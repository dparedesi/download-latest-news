Title: Ethereum supply drops – Yet Tom Lee insists ‘$3K is still undervalued’

ETH is trading differently than traditional tech stocks. Ethereum [ETH] is sending mixed signals. Some mid-size whales are trimming their holdings, while the biggest players barely care. Yet despite ETH trading at elevated valuations for years, more people continue to hold it… and less ETH sits on exchanges. Are investors seeing Ethereum through a different, longer-term lens? Ethereum’s accumulation heatmap shows that the 1-10K ETH cohort was the first to sell into strength, and they did it right near the price top. These mid-size whales sold heavily during the peak, capturing profits while the market was still celebrating new highs. What’s more, is that they haven’t stopped. Source: Alphractal Selling from this group continues, keeping pressure on ETH even as sentiment remains upbeat. In contrast, the largest holders (wallets with more than 10K ETH) are far more neutral. They’re neither panic-selling nor aggressively buying. This might be why ETH’s rally has struggled to find smooth momentum. ETH held on CEXs has been dropping, falling from around 14.5 million ETH in late July to nearly 12.5 million ETH at press time. Investors (both retail and institutional) are moving coins off exchanges and into long-term storage. So far, consistent outflows reduce immediate sell pressure and prove confidence. Source: X Even as mid-size whales continue taking profits, the broader trend shows fewer holders keeping ETH available to sell. Despite Ethereum trading at a fully diluted P/S ratio above 100x for years, levels most dot‑com companies never sustained, the number of holders continues to rise. Charts reveal Ethereum’s P/S repeatedly spiking above 1,000x, at times approaching 3,000x, while total addresses have now surpassed 250 million. Source: X Holders aren’t treating ETH like a revenue-driven tech stock. Instead, many appear to value it as a long-term settlement asset. The idea is probably that its utility, network effects, and role in shaping digital money outweigh its short-term financial ratios. Adding to the bullish outlook, Bitmine’s Tom Lee says Ethereum at $3K is grossly undervalued. He mentioned the probability of ETH reaching $12K based on its 8-year average, with upside scenarios of $22K and even $62K per ETH. This is the long-term potential that many investors seem to already price in.

By Rolling Stone If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission. There are two kinds of people in this world: those who are easy to shop for, and those who make the holiday season a little more challenging with their picky, well, let’s call it specific taste. With hundreds of websites to choose from, and the holidays fast approaching (most shipping deadlines are Dec. 17, 2025, to arrive in time for Christmas), how do you find unique gifts for the nice-list members who are a bit more particular? Our Rolling Stone editors have put together a guide featuring more than 60 of the best gifts to grab this holiday season. While most of these items are music-oriented — that’s what we do, after all — we’ve also included a few surprises that will make anyone feel merry and bright. From Grateful Dead collaborations to band merch that’s a lot more premium than digging through a bargain bin to the best in tech and tested audio equipment, these are our top-rated gifts for this holiday season. So go ahead, read, peek, and add to cart. It’s everything you didn’t know you were looking for, all in one place. From musician autobiographies to coffee-table books featuring your favorite bands, these are the best gifts for every reader. $22.17 $29.99 26% off Lawrence Burney’s debut, No Sense in Wishing: Essays, traces the author and cultural critic’s musical journey from his formative years in Baltimore to transformative experiences in Lagos and Johannesburg. Burney explores turning points like watching his mother perform as the opening act at a Gil Scott-Heron show, Lupe Fiasco introducing him to a kind of Blackness he initially thought was “corny as shit,“ and the New York fandom leading him to interrogate regional distinctions of Blackness. The collection of essays transcends the author’s personal self-searching to become a fresh ethno-musical study. $24.50 $35.00 30% off Cameron Crowe’s semi-autobiographical film, Almost Famous, was inspired by his early days as a teenage Rolling Stone reporter. Now, Crowe returns to that familiar territory, without the gloss of fiction. The Uncool is a memoir documenting a raucous time for rock & roll and a freewheeling moment in this publication’s history, when the merely 16-year-old Crowe profiled artists like Led Zeppelin and Jackson Browne. There’s no shortage of famous faces in The Uncool: David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, and Kris Kristofferson, to name a few. But there are some not-so-famous ones, too; Crowe dives deep on his family, offering a portrait of his parents and his Southern Californian upbringing. $50.37 $65.00 23% off Jill Furmanovsky’s Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere would have been the ideal tribute to what once was, if not for the unlikeliest of unlikely story lines — the brothers Gallagher reuniting for one of the most unforgettable tours in the history of rock & roll. Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere features hundreds of photos of the band in the studio, onstage, and everywhere in between. Furmanovsky has photographed Oasis since the Definitely Maybe days, making this one of the most intimate looks at a band that would immodestly — but not incorrectly — call themselves Familiar to Millions. $107.23 $150.00 29% off Anton Corbijn’s music-video credits play like a greatest hits of rock from the 1980s onward. From U2 and Depeche Mode to Nirvana and Metallica, Corbijn has been there, camera in tow. This retrospective compiles hundreds of photographs from Corbijn’s archives, including portraits of R.E.M., the Rolling Stones, and Nick Cave. The book also includes written contributions from Adam Clayton of U2, Marlene Dumas, Johan Faes, Samantha Morton, and Tom Waits. $55.00 From her live performances to her music videos, Mitski has an undeniable power of drawing audiences in. Photographer Ebru Yıldız distills that electric energy into King of All the Land, a 144-page art book featuring powerful black-and-white images of Mitski, shot around Nashville. Yıldız is known largely for her portraits of musicians, from John Cale and David Byrne to Lucy Dacus and Angel Olsen. King of All the Land documents the synergy of two artists — Yıldız and Mitski — and their singular, uncompromising visions. $71.96 $100.00 28% off This photography book from rock & roll photographer Elliott Landy comprises nearly 400 images of the Band during a formative year from 1968 to ’69. The group was creating their first two albums, Music from Big Pink and The Band, which birthed a new Americana sound. “I don’t believe there will ever be anything that even vaguely resembles that kind of musical unity again. Nor does there need to be. They said it all,” writes Eric Clapton, in the book’s foreword. $69.90 $75.00 7% off This definitive behind-the-scenes book delivers the full story of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Journalist and author Jay Glennie worked with Quentin Tarantino to unearth photographs from the set, concept art, production memos, and other artifacts from the film’s creation. The book also includes more than 65 exclusive interviews with cast and crew members, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. It’s a peek at how the double Oscar-winner was created, and Tarantino’s movie-making process. $14.50 Sometimes it’s far more interesting to dive into an autobiography than a fantasy novel — no shade to our beloved fiction favorites. But this one about Eighties pop icon Debbie Gibson is easily one of the most compelling reads to hit our list in years. At 178 pages, it’s a tight, intimate look at Gibson’s life and career. $12.81 $27.99 54% off Rob Sheffield — bestselling author, journalist, and longtime Rolling Stone contributing editor (since 1997, no big deal) — has written eight books on music, TV, and pop culture. His latest, Heartbreak Is the National Anthem, might be his most powerful yet.With an in-depth look into the life and legacy of Taylor Swift, he explores everything from the magical relationship she has with her fans and her songwriting prowess to her ability to captivate stadiums filled with 90,000 people. It’s a “Timeless” masterpiece that you’ll want to read over and over again. $11.99 Music journalist Jeff Weiss spent the first years of his career in Los Angeles working for celebrity tabloids at a time when the medium was at its peak. In the early 2000s, before blogs and social media pushed the industry off its track, Weiss carved out a niche as a young and hungry writer willing to concoct elaborate fake personas in order to chase down the day’s biggest story. Of course, the most prominent pop star of the time, Britney Spears, was always in his crosshairs. This book, which documents his time in the ethically murky industry, not only charts her rise from a bubbly Louisiana teen to her entry into a conservatorship but also wrestles with his own complicity in her downfall. While it’s not entirely nonfiction — Weiss has admitted that some of the scenes were created with literary license, though he’s declined to say exactly which ones — it’s a frenetic and engrossing read, perfect for anyone interested in Spears’ career or tabloid media’s race to the bottom. The most impressive part of the book is the care with which he comes at the subject. “I tried to make it a sympathetic portrayal of Britney,” Weiss told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “I didn’t want to be condescending to her.” $25.06 $29.00 14% off We know you’re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but trust us, this paperback by Mark Ronson reads just as good as it looks. On sale for the holidays, it’s an authentic and compelling account from the man behind some of today’s most influential tracks. $33.17 $50.00 34% off Photography legend Jim Marshall’s book, The Grateful Dead: Photos and Stories From the Formative Years, 1966-1977, is the first-ever collection dedicated solely to his work with the Grateful Dead. This book features some of the most revealing and previously unseen images of the band, most of which were captured in San Francisco. It also includes notable musicians like Janis Joplin, Neil Young, David Crosby, and others. Additionally, the book includes an afterward by John Mayer, the frontman and guitarist of Dead & Company. It features colored edges, making it a perfect gift for fans of the psychedelic scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Whether they’re a fan from afar or proudly “with the band,” these gifts — from home decor to limited-edition games and instruments — are must-haves for any music devotee. $45.00 Noah Kahan’s beloved album Stick Season may have dropped in 2022, but our staff still has it on repeat (just peek at a few of our Spotify Wrapped receipts). If there’s a Kahan fan in your life, or honestly just someone who lives in New England, grab this Stick Season candle by Ranger Station. It smells like a chilly day in Maine, but without the frostbite. The brand notes it has a long burn time too, of up to 30 hours. $36.98 $75.00 51% off Barbie has released plenty of diva dolls over the years — there was the recent Stevie Nicks launch, the Aaliyah Barbie that sold out in seconds, and now a drop dedicated to the Queen of Christmas herself, Mariah Carey. Decked out in her sparkly red dress, this rare doll is already almost sold out on Amazon. So if you’re waiting for the right “tiiiiiime!” to add it to your cart for the collector in your life, this is it. $21.25 $25.00 15% off Shopping for musicians can be trickier than it seems — most are extremely particular about their gear (understandably so; not every axe is created equal). That’s why we suggest something like this leather guitar-pick holder. It’s way less pressure than choosing a new guitar for them, but just as useful — and it still feels thoughtful. Plus, Etsy notes that you can engrave the case, making them feel like the rock star they already are. $1,210.00 Ah, sometimes we miss the nostalgic days of the boombox era … OK, we’re mostly kidding, because playing music on your phone is definitely more convenient. But that longing for the good-old days pops up now and then. That’s why we love this necklace from editor-favorite brand Sydney Evan. It’s cheeky yet chic and makes a great gift for yourself or the fellow Nineties wild child in your life. $79.96 Good golly, Miss Dolly! The country superstar has done it again: this time with wines that taste far more premium than their affordable price tag. Available on the Home Shopping Network in various multi-packs, these Dolly Parton-branded wines come in adorable packaging with an even punchier taste. They’re the perfect gift for any holiday soiree or secret Santa exchange. $16.30 If you want presents as unique as the person receiving them, Uncommon Goods is our go-to. These music-themed playing cards feature legends like Amy Winehouse, David Bowie, and Prince, making them an ace when it comes to gifting. Grab a deck for as low as $16. $39.99 Surprise your favorite Metallica fan with the very same stainless-steel tumbler used by James Ulrich onstage. He even has a specially designed microphone stand with a bottle holder for his Yeti when he’s performing live. This 20-ounce cup keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot — whether you’re singing onstage or having a casual karaoke sesh by the fire this holiday season. $329.00 $388.00 15% off If you want to win the award for giving your favorite musician the coolest gift they’ve ever received (or seen, for that matter), this sampler is it. For less than $330, it’s “packed with over 400 handcrafted instruments and sounds from iconic reggae producers, plus a synth engine with classic bass and lead tones and pressure-sensitive dub sirens,” according to the brand. $1,149.00 This gorgeous, compact, and incredibly playable instrument will instantly become anyone’s couch guitar of choice, and it’s also set up with the electronics you need to play out. As the brand-new junior model of Jeff Tweedy’s just-reissued signature 00DB — which aimed to emulate Woody Guthrie’s guitars of choice — it’s also shockingly affordable for a Martin signature guitar, with a tight, punchy sound. It’s made of sustainable wood too. Only one warning: If you buy this thing and fail to instantly write “Handshake Drugs”-level masterpieces on it, that’s on you. $50.00 Valhalla digital plugins are the behind-the-scenes secret sauce on everything from pop smashes to single-stream hopefuls. Always affordable, simple to use, and beautifully designed, their newest drop, FutureVerb’s clean spaces pair easily with highly colored echoes, easily transforming generic ho-hum sounds into towering epic studio ’scapes. $24.95 “Roll dice and leave your bummers behind,” advertises Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey, a new game from Twogether Studios. This game does all that and more, as you roll extremely groovy dice (they’re tie-dye, obviously), and take trips around the iconic frontman’s artwork while accumulating tokens. The packaging also includes a “cosmic journey bag” that you can use for the game pieces or … other items. “My dad’s legacy lives on through moments of joy, laughter, and connection,” Trixie Garcia said in a statement. “Like music, games foster community, and Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey is a whimsical way for fans to keep that spirit alive wherever the road may lead.” Amen to that. $17.98 The Twice trio recorded their own version of Huntr/x’s original diss track “Takedown” for this film’s soundtrack, and the group’s own song “Strategy” is also included in the film and on the album. Even if you’ve just had the Saja Boys’ infectious “Soda Pop” stuck in your head for weeks (we don’t blame you, us too), then you’ll want to order it now before it sells out ahead of the holidays. The CD comes with a fold-out poster and photo card (random one of three), like a real K-pop album. $215.00 Shopping for a Wilco fan? All you need is this box set and tickets to one of their upcoming shows, and you can check them off your list twice in one go. $99.00 Backpack-sized and ready to fit into every producer’s setup, this is going to become a must, especially for laptop warriors. With real people-size controls, a screen so you can see what all the many, many knobs are actually doing, and a way to hit stop when your jam gets out of control, Akai’s new midi controller finally gets this small form factor right. $170.18 Few things are as striking as this White Stripes vinyl set — and, yes, that even includes decorations bought at Tiffany’s. Grab it now while it’s still in stock at Walmart for under $200, so they can spend the rest of the holidays jamming out to classics like “Black Math” and “Seven Nation Army.” $349.99 A turntable is always a great gift — whether they live and breathe vinyl or just want to give their living space a retro upgrade. $26.14 $32.99 21% off Bummed the five-foot-tall superstar’s Short n’ Sweet tour is over? Continue the sleepover party with these two dazzling records: The recent Grammy-nominated Man’s Best Friend and her 2023 Christmas EP, Fruitcake. The former is available in several spectacular vinyl variants, from iridescent blue to light brown, as well as several alternate covers that are worth getting your hands on. Fruitcake, one of the strongest Christmas albums from a pop star in years, is jam-packed (no pun intended) with Carpenter’s signature melodies and innuendos, only holiday themed (“I need that Charles Dickens,” she sings on “A Nonsense Christmas”). The milky, clear, and liquid glitter vinyl sold out instantly, but plenty of other colors are available. Put that on with Carpenter’s 2024 Christmas special in the background, and you’ll have a ho-ho holiday. $23.99 A gift that transcends generations, this limited-edition Buckingham Nicks baby-blue vinyl is a present worth fighting over. Perfect for your cousin who just discovered Fleetwood Mac on TikTok — or your grandmother who hasn’t stopped playing it since the Seventies. It’s a Yankee Swap winner. $20.99 Wondering what to do with your stack of cassettes after your 2006 Honda finally bit the dust? For those of us still committed to portable physical media — without the CD skips — Amazon has a perfect solution. This portable cassette player lets you revisit your collection using your favorite wired or wireless headphones. The best part is its ability to record, too, meaning endless possibilities to impress that special someone with a good old-fashioned mix tape. $39.99 For the aspiring studio rat in your life, give them a break and get them what they won’t get themselves. A way to figure out what’s wrong when there’s no sound happening. This affordable Swiss army knife of a cable tester will help them figure out that they need to take better care of their connections. From the best Bluetooth speakers to over-ear cans that block out the world, these tech-forward gifts are everything they’ve been wanting this season. $129.00 $149.00 13% off With a stylish transparent case and plenty of smart features, Nothing’s earbuds are a standout, and the sound quality outperforms a lot of the competition at this price. Replace your giftee’s old, tired buds this season with a fresh new pair (for 13 percent off). $179.99 From its long-lasting battery life (30-plus hours on a charge) to its packable frame, the Marshall Emberton speaker checks all of our boxes for a great, reliable outdoor speaker. We’ve used ours to play music outside for months (and left it there, accidentally), because that’s what it’s designed to do. It can handle rain, serious dust, and hours of tunes. Bonus: The retro design instantly makes any patio look cooler. $59.95 Over the past couple of years, Loop has established itself as the leader in universal-fit earplugs. Most of our staff (myself included) have extensively tested the brand’s bestsellers and can confidently say the hype is real. I love their metallic, jewelry-like design, which makes them better-looking than most earplugs (unless you want total discretion). More importantly, I love the excellent noise-reduction that turns down the volume without sacrificing audio quality.The Loop Switch 2 is our top pick from the brand. Unlike most earplugs, you can adjust how much volume is let in by shifting a dial (no need to swap tips). The plugs have three modes: “Quiet,” “Experience,” and “Engage,” ranging from almost full quiet to noise-dampening. The former is great for non-concert activities, as well as extremely loud shows, while the “Engage” option is ideal for full immersion and occasional conversations. $499.99 $599.99 17% off Polaroid’s flagship camera will take your instant photos to the next level. With tack-sharp autofocus and fully-manual controls built into the camera (and even more available via an App), you can take full command behind the lens. The I-2 lens contains the largest aperture of any Polaroid camera to date, allowing for beautiful portraits and lower-light shooting that was never possible before. $649.00 $849.95 24% off The X Half combines analog ideas in a digital format. At its simplest, the camera is fun-sized, vertically-oriented, and loaded up with Fuji’s signature-film presets based on the brand’s own classic film stocks. To really turn up the old-school experience, there is a “film camera mode” that prevents image previews, which requires the user to use a film advance lever to enable the next frame. In standard mode, that same lever can also be used to enable split-frame photography, much like the original half-frame cameras that it is based on. $449.99 $549.00 18% off I first tried these headphones last summer, when a manager played me a song on them. I was stunned by the sound quality and immediately asked what brand they were. There’s a lot to love with the AirPods Max: The sound is expansive and truly noise-cancelling; they instantly connect to all of my devices; and they have a long battery life. Plus, they’re available in flattering colors and actually fit my tiny head, unlike previous headphones. They sit snug and comfortably in place, whether I’m sitting at my desk, walking around New York City, or even running on the treadmill. It’s a steep price, but totally worth it when I think about how much use I’m getting out of them and how perfect a gift they’d make. $699.99 You know a gift is truly great when it’s sold out almost everywhere — who doesn’t remember the Cabbage Patch craze of the Eighties? Luckily, we tracked down the Marshall Heston 60 soundbar, still available at Best Buy in limited quantities. While it comes with a $699 price tag, it’ll amp up movie night for any cinephile in your life. $89.00 $99.00 10% off Finding a great gift can already feel like a win, but scoring one on sale makes the season even merrier and brighter. Take this wireless audio streamer, for instance: Available on Amazon with delivery in less than two days via Prime, it’s a fun little gadget that fits neatly on a desk or bedside table. $1,199.99 $1,499.99 20% off Our staff tested dozens of speakers this year, and Klipsch’s the Sevens were the best in terms of sound, price, and design. The midcentury-inspired bookshelf speakers deliver a beautiful sound stage and a warm, full experience — no matter what kind of music you’re playing. They don’t require an amp, making them a great gift for audiophiles and newbies alike. $399.99 $449.00 11% off Bose’s latest QuietComfort Ultra headphones, released in October, combine the all-day comfort and industry-leading noise canceling Bose is known for with subtle, but genuinely useful upgrades over the original 2023 model. The latest generation of the headphones features a similar design to the first generation, but with polished metal yokes instead of matte. While I personally preferred the understated matte accents, the QC Ultra 2 headphones nonetheless have a stylish, high-end look. They’re lightweight, but the headband and ear cups have ample, comfortable cushioning. Overall, when it comes to performance and features, noise-canceling and audio quality, and comfort and design, the QC Ultra 2 headphones are as close to the complete package as anything on the market. While we love digging through concert merch bins and scouring our favorite thrift shops for the coolest band gear, these clothing picks are just as awesome — with half the effort. $68.00 Imogene + Willie offers some of the softest 100-percent cotton graphic tees, as well as adorable caps and beanies. Originally a denim company, Imogene + Willie has evolved into a full retail shop with brick-and-mortar locations in Austin and Nashville. Their designs are heavily influenced by music, and they collaborate with artists like Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Billy Strings, as well as iconic venues like the Grand Ole Opry. Their clothing is both stylish and cozy, creating a perfect concert outfit. We test a lot of clothing at Rolling Stone, but there’s one brand we keep coming back to: Dr. Martens. The iconic footwear company just dropped these new stud-covered shoes, and we’re already chomping at the bit to wear them to our next rock concert. Sure, they’d make an epic gift for anyone on your nice list, but honestly? They’re the kind of steal you should snap up for yourself while they’re still in stock. $250.00+ There’s no shortage of merch for Deadheads, from dog bowls to toothbrush holders. And don’t even get us started on apparel. The Dead have done collaborations with everyone from Old Navy to designer Gabriela Hearst. So, where does one get the best Steal Your Face sweater? Look no further than Alice + Olivia, who just released their new collab with the Dead (their second since 2016) in honor of the iconic band’s 60th anniversary. It’s difficult not to be overwhelmed by the amount of stellar items they have, but I recommend the skull pullover and muscle tank, which are great quality and fit perfectly. However, any of the items make a great gift for the Deadhead in your life — they’re sure to be merry and grateful. $125.00 You know what they say: The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time — especially when it’s covered in embroidered emblems. Available in sizes from small to 2XL, there are “No Surprises” with this Radiohead jumper: It’s high-quality, has a premium design, and will make your giftee look like the opposite of a “Creep.” $17.40 Socks can be a controversial gift, does Dad really need another pair of crisp, white calf coverings? But this black-and-white pair, made in collaboration with American band Blue Angel, is a massive upgrade from the basic gift. $110.00 Sometimes it’s worth taking style tips from some of our favorite celebrities, like Matthew McConaughey and Brooke Shields, and this time, they were definitely right about Caddis glasses. The eyewear brand, which has been crafting some of Hollywood’s favorite reading and prescription frames since 2017, is a viral sensation — and one that actually lives up to the hype. With multiple styles to choose from, Caddis glasses keep anyone on trend, whether it’s just for fun (sunglasses) or for necessity (progressive readers). $110.00+ The perfect gift for any jam-band fan is a vintage T-shirt from Jesse Lockwood’s Primarily Dead shop. While the shop (which has been operating since 2020) features primarily Dead items (as its name suggests), it also offers T-shirts, stickers, and more from bands like Phish, the Allman Brothers, Pink Floyd, and other classic-rock and jam bands. Lockwood is very selective about what he sells, offering an array of choices, telling Rolling Stone, “Every one of these shirts has a story to tell — some were made and sold by fans in small batches in parking lots just to generate enough money to get to the next show, some are licensed single-show shirts made by the band and only sold at that venue, and others were more widely available. They all create a nostalgic feeling for both the people that were there and the people that wish they could have been there.” Lockwood also sources shirts. If you are looking for something specific, contact him on Instagram @primarily_dead or through his website, https://www.primarilydead.com/. $76.00 They don’t have to be a star on the court to love this Tennis Brat crew-neck sweater. This social media sensation works for every It-girl (or It-boy) on your shopping list thanks to the brand’s premium fabrics, easy fit, and unmistakable logo. $224.25 $299.00 25% off It’s no secret that the little black bricks in our pockets can be a major attention hog, but paradoxically, there are some situations where integrating tech in more places makes it less obtrusive. Take Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses, which let you record photos, video, and more, all while keeping your phone securely stashed. First released in 2023, Meta’s Ray-Ban AI glasses have outlasted other smart glasses for one simple, undeniable reason — they don’t look ridiculous. Instead, Meta smartly leveraged the recognizable style of the world’s most iconic eyewear brand, landing on a design that’s barely more conspicuous than regular Wayfarers. If you want an all-encompassing gift — from gaming gear to experiential presents — these finds are perfect for a variety of ages and interests. $59.99 If there’s just one game you need to play from 2025, it’s Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The French RPG draws inspiration from Japanese titans of the genre like Final Fantasy, with a dynamic combat system that blends turn-based strategy and rhythmic parrying. And while the action is engaging, it’s the heartbreaking narrative and world-building that’s made the year’s most talked-about game a sensation. Set in a fantasy realm where a divine entity known as the Paintress eradicates everyone over a certain age year after year, players take on the roles of the latest band of would-be saviors on a suicide mission to bring humanity back from the brink. With award-worthy voice work from actors like Charlie Cox, Jennifer Hale, and Andy Serkis, the story presented in-game is a genuine tearjerker, and should be experienced by the widest possible audience, even if RPGs aren’t normally your bag. $498.88 A new generation of Nintendo hardware is always an event, but there’s some special alchemy that’s put Switch 2 on another level. The hybrid handheld/home console has quickly become the fastest selling console of all time, largely in part because of its, frankly, insane lineup of new games and the ability to play legacy Switch titles.The console’s library includes all-new releases like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and Metroid Prime 4 — many of which are among the best games of the year — on top of upgraded versions of classics like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. With great ports of high-end games like Cyberpunk 2077 and indies like Hades II, Switch 2 is one of the most diverse platforms available, with something for every kind of player. $399.99 A good pair of gaming headphones is essential these days, as cinematic experiences and high-stakes online competition demand the best possible soundscape. And while it’s one thing to hear well, Razer Kraken V4 Pro cans provide a visceral physical response to in-game action with HD haptics. What does that mean? It’s essentially the tactile feedback (a.k.a. vibrations) that are now standard in all game controllers but applied to the headset.On PC, Kraken V4 Pro headphones can be paired with other Razer devices via Synapse to create a unique user profile — with certain titles like Borderlands 4 having been custom-tuned to provide haptic feedback and THX spatial audio tailored to the game. But using the OLED control hub, it can connect to basically anything (Switch, PS5, even mobile devices) via BlueTooth, USB, or auxiliary cable. It’s like having a rumbling IMAX theater wrapped around your head. $25.00+ Some people prefer to gift experiences rather than tangible items, and we’re 100 percent on board. A StubHub gift card lets them choose an event near them — whether it’s a concert, comedy show, or dance performance. There’s something for every type of fan. $6.00+ MasterClass is one of the internet’s favorite ways to learn a new skill, with courses on everything from music to acting to cooking. The best part? Every course is taught by an expert in the field, and many are also A-list celebrities. Gift it this holiday season for as low as $6. $65.00 Longtime cannabis activist Jane West got her start making accessories way back in 2016, right around the time weed was legalized in her home state of Colorado. She’d been working to promote women within the male-dominated industry, and her product line was similarly focused. We’ve been fans for the past decade, partaking in her ever-growing line of pipes, one-hitters, bongs, and bubblers, sometimes disguised as makeup compacts for discreet use. But her newest endeavor, the Twenties Collection, is by far our favorite. Inspired by Art Deco designs, these cut-glass objects are as beautiful as they are functional, and this hand pipe has become our favorite smoking object in our extensive arsenal. $90.00 There’s an unspoken competition about who looks best on the slopes, and these Grateful Dead and Knockaround snow goggles will help your favorite snowboarder or skier claim the title. Grab them at Dick’s Sporting Goods for under $100. $199.25 Building Lego’s 1,074-piece Fender Stratocaster set feels almost as gratifying as performing a solo on the guitar used by legends from Jimi Hendrix to Kurt Cobain. Everything here feels true to life, albeit miniaturized, including the Lego brick-based guitar’s pickup switch, tuning pegs, textile strap, stand, and picks (you have a choice of four colors). The best part? The fact that the set comes with an opportunity to view the final piece’s interior details, like its motherboard, not to mention that you can create the guitar in either black or red. Ideal for both rock & roll aficionados and the Lego-obsessed, this is a holiday gift that will keep on giving. After all, your recipient can rebuild it an endless amount of times (and our editors recommend doing just that). $9.99 We may be biased, but a Rolling Stone subscription is about as good as it gets.

Posted in: Amazon MGM Studios, Movies, Netflix, Warner Bros | Tagged: Amazon MGM Studios, netflix, Warner Bros Amazon MGM Studios begins its theatrical commitment in 2026, and Netflix should keep an eye on it as a possible path forward for Warner Bros. Yesterday, it became official; one of the oldest movie studios, Warner Bros., has officially been acquired by the first streaming service, Netflix. In many ways, people were not surprised. Warner Bros. has changed hands so many times in the last decade that if each leadership change didn't come with layoffs, it would be funny. There are a lot of big feelings from every part of the industry right now, but getting an idea of what Netflix could do in the future might be as easy as looking to 2026. When Amazon acquired MGM in 2022, the conversation surrounding that move was very similar to the one we had yesterday. Everyone was sure that a studio approaching its centennial had just been bought by the company that symbolized everything wrong in the world. People were sure this was the end for the studio, and we had seen the last of any MGM film in theaters. Then things began to move in what is now known as Amazon MGM Studios. It wasn't immediate, because things rarely are, but in May 2025, Amazon MGM Studios took to the stage at South by Southwest and confirmed their commitment to the theatrical model. The number they gave was 12-14 movies a year, but obviously, that isn't something we were going to see in 2025, so the first year of Amazon MGM's commitment begins in 2026, and they are doing so with some big films. They kicked down the doors at CinemaCon last year with a massive late-night presentation that no one was expecting, with a ton of footage and projects announced and confirmed. If Netflix is looking for a model that could emulate Warner Bros., something the industry should keep an eye on is how Amazon MGM does at the box office in 2026. If it works, there is a good chance they have found the sweet spot that confirms theatrical releases for a nice chunk of films while also acknowledging that not every movie can make it to the theaters. No one has ever said there weren't movies that were better off on streaming; it's dismissing the theatrical experience entirely. CinemaCon is in April, and whether or not Netflix and Warner Bros. show up is going to be a really telling sign for the studios' relationship with exhibition. Meanwhile, we'll also see if the Amazon MGM Studios commitment works out and not so subtly point out to Ted that you can acquire a decades-old studio and remain mostly true to its original intent.

Title: Crypto Sell-Off: Binance, Coinbase, Dump Over $2 Billion In Bitcoin As Prices Dip Below $90,000

Time Published: 2025-12-06T12:00:54Z

The cryptocurrency market experienced another wave of liquidations on Friday, with Bitcoin (BTC) prices dipping below the critical support level of $90,000. This decline followed a brief rally that had seen its price rise approximately $3,000 above this threshold earlier in the week. Data from CoinGlass reveals that nearly $430 million in liquidations occurred across the crypto market over the past 24 hours, predominantly affecting leveraged long positions, which accounted for about $350 million. During this period, Bitcoin underwent a 3.5% retracement, with its price settling at just above $89,120—a stark 29% below its all-time high of over $126,000 reached in October. Market expert OxNobler recently highlighted the role of both retail and institutional investors in this downturn. In a post on social media platform X, OxNobler detailed the reason behind Bitcoin’s decline: significant sell-offs by major players. According to the analyst, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, sold 4,000 BTC; U.S.-based Coinbase (COIN) liquidated 5,675 BTC; and traditional finance giant Fidelity sold 3,288 BTC. Additionally, market maker Wintermute offloaded 1,793 BTC. Notably, the analyst pointed out that Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which is the largest public company holder of Bitcoin with over 650,000 coins, has also sold over 3,820 coins in this same time frame. The firm’s sell-off comes on the heels of speculation regarding Strategy’s potential to liquidate some of its holdings due to the substantial losses affecting its financial performance amid declining Bitcoin prices. When Strategy CEO Phong Le was questioned about the possibility of selling off Bitcoin, he acknowledged that while the firm’s former CEO, Michael Saylor, has consistently opposed selling, circumstances may change if the company’s stock trades below the net value of its Bitcoin holdings, which aligns with the recent actions taken by the firm. Interestingly, while these institutional sell-offs have contributed to the current market dip, Coinbase’s institutional division has projected a potential recovery for the crypto market in December, citing improving liquidity, a 92% probability of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting rates, and supportive macroeconomic conditions. Analysts have pointed out several reasons for optimism, including the recovery of liquidity, the resilience of the “AI bubble,” and the attractiveness of short US dollar trades at current levels. However, OxNobler warned that the situation may not be so straightforward. Alongside the activities of major institutions, he noted that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, had recently sold $130 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Furthermore, Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, seems to have resumed selling Ethereum, with millions of ETH being moved from the foundation’s wallet through Gnosis Safe. Ultimately, OxNobler asserts that these institutional activities may have a hand in manipulating crypto prices and preventing them from climbing to higher levels and key resistance points.

BlackRock’s routine transfers mask bearish signals as RSI and MACD confirm short-term selling momentum dominance. The crypto market is showing strain. After failing to stay above $94,000, Bitcoin [BTC] fell 2.6% to a low of around $89,596, as of press time. At the same time, Ethereum [ETH] mirrored the move with a 3.72% drop to $3,038. This sharp correction has fueled fear among retail investors. Yet, behind the panic, institutional giants are increasing their commitments and doubling down. On the 5th of December, BlackRock deposited $125.5 million in BTC and $2.5 million in ETH to Coinbase. Analyst Ted Pillows warns that this could precede an institutional selling wave, potentially adding further instability. He said, “More selling?” And, hence, a question arises: Is the current dip a signal for deeper selling, or is it simply smart money quietly defining the new, higher floor of this ETF-driven cycle? The recent price drop, following Bitcoin’s inability to hold the $94,000 level, has inevitably focused attention on large institutional movements, specifically, BlackRock’s multi-million dollar deposit of BTC and ETH to Coinbase. In the crypto market, large transfers to exchanges are quickly seen as bearish, mainly due to liquidation risk, since they increase the supply that could be sold. With ETF outflows and macro uncertainty already heightening nerves, the market reacts sharply to such movements. So, if institutions did liquidate, the added supply could push prices lower, a fear reinforced by past cases where big deposits preceded corrections. For retail investors, seeing major funds move assets onto trading platforms often signals trouble ahead. However, this panic misses a key point: managing multi-billion-dollar ETFs often requires routine transfers that have nothing to do with imminent selling. However, a deposit alone does not automatically equate to further sales. For an ETF issuer like BlackRock, such fund movements often reflect routine operational needs, custody adjustments, redemption processing, rebalancing, or other internal workflows. BlackRock relies on Coinbase Prime for institutional custody and high‑volume trading, reflecting a systematic strategy rather than panic selling. Often, such large transfers are routine steps in ETF creation and redemption processes designed to keep prices aligned. Even so, technical indicators continue to suggest a bearish outlook in the short term. At the time of writing, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) were lying below their neutral levels, confirming the dominance of selling momentum in the short-to-medium term. Source: Trading View To decisively flip the market narrative from “bear in control” to “bullish breakout,” Bitcoin must successfully cross and hold the key resistance level at $98,000. Until then, the market remains technically subdued and vulnerable to volatility.

A father of four young children is “very upset” because his €244 weekly disability allowance has been cut by €80. An elderly woman who has custody of her two grandchildren has “nothing left for food” after paying her bills. These are among the stories heard on more than 900 calls for help made during a single morning this week to the St Vincent de Paul eastern region call centre in Dublin. The centre, on Sean McDermott Street in the north inner city, takes calls from counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. It will receive about 1,500 by the day’s end from households “desperately struggling and stressed”, says Sinead Gill, the information lead for the region. “We are up 7 per cent on the number of calls since last year. Nationally, there were 250,000 calls in 2024 and, as usual, we are exceptionally busy at Christmas,” she says. “People are finding it really, really tough, especially without the extra double-payments. They were a huge help last year, but they’re gone,” she adds, referring to the two double-payment child benefits paid in late 2024 but not repeated in this year’s budget in October. [ Saint Vincent de Paul expects over a quarter of a million Christmas calls for helpOpens in new window ] The housing crisis and the “inadequacy” of social welfare rates to meet basic needs are key drivers of poverty, says Gill. “You can hear the stress in people’s voices. People are finding it so, so hard to cover the costs of basics like food, heat and even winter clothes for their kids.” Kate Darcy, one of five information support officers on duty, takes 13 calls over a 25-minute period. If a caller is on her database, she checks their details before reassuring them a volunteer will contact them to arrange a visit before Christmas. If someone is a first-time caller, she takes details of their situation. “You’re a couple with four children?,” she asks a mother. “You are all right. No don’t apologise,” she adds “Look, I have you down for the Christmas help. We don’t have a date yet for that area but they will be out and they will call you. Keep your phone on. God bless.” Another mother calls. “It’s three children you have? And you are struggling in general? I know, I know. I really do ... No problem at all, love; don’t be worrying.” An older woman in north Dublin calls. “Are your grandchildren still there with you? They are. And how can I help you?” Darcy explains after the call that the woman missed a visit from volunteers the previous evening. “I will get them to give you a ring back ... No problem at all. Take care,” she tells the woman, On her screen a log of locations from which calls have come this morning includes areas all over Dublin: Cherry Orchard; Tallaght; Swords; Crumlin; Rathmines; Chapelizod; from Priorswood on the north side of the city to Rialto on the south side; and from Malahide in north Co Dublin down to Bray in Co Wicklow, and as far as Athy in Co Kildare. “You get calls from every area – most are from the more struggling areas, but we get calls too from Foxrock, Ranelagh, Blackrock, Killiney,” she says, referring to areas of Dublin known for their affluence. “There isn’t an area we haven’t had a call from.” Jackie Ryan, who is logging email requests for help, has had more than 1,000 since last week. “All need help with food – that or electric, or gas.” She reads some out, withholding names of senders. A mother in Dublin 10 writes: “I am looking for help for myself and my two boys. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.” Another mother, in Dublin 8, says: “Dear Vincent de Paul, I am writing to yous to request help. I am struggling immensely keeping up with bills and groceries. I am very concerned with how I am going to afford to buy my son’s presents this year considering I have not been able to save due to being so tight on money. [ ‘Why shouldn’t everyone have some nice things at Christmas?’: A day on a charity food runOpens in new window ] “I have applied for a part-time job to suits my son’s hours in school to no avail. I am under so much pressure. Any help would be highly appreciated.” “She is struggling big time,” says Ryan. “God love her.” A man in his 70s, living alone, writes: “My wife died last year. I am finding it hard on my income.” A single mother is in homeless accommodation with her daughter. “She will be three in January. I was looking for any sort of help possible for Christmas, anything at all would be greatly appreciated, so much.” Appeals for help also come in by post. Darcy reads one, written on a page torn from a child’s school copybook. “I am a full-time carer. My son has [a] disease and my grandson [lives with us]. I would greatly appreciate any help or a food voucher. I have an open fireplace if you could help me with some coal or turf. Thank you kindly.” Some of the calls can be “very distressing” for call-takers says Margo Duffy, who has been with the society for more than a decade. “There will be the odd one that just gets you. It is only when you are working in a job like this that you realise there is so much stress out there, so much poverty,” she says. The charity continues to welcome donations, of money and new toys, says Gill. “We also need more volunteers. Unfortunately, we cannot visit everyone who calls for help this Christmas because we just don’t have enough volunteers,” she says. “That is very hard.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock’s $28.7M ETH buy signals a new era – What’s cooking?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=551532
Time Published: 2025-12-06T03:00:25Z
Full Content:
Why are giants like BlackRock and BitMine racing to amass millions of ETH? BlackRock’s latest $28.78 million acquisition of Ethereum is drawing global attention. However, its true significance is being missed. This move is not a speculative gamble on a token’s price. Instead, it is a strategic signal about Ethereum’s established role as critical financial infrastructure. Moving beyond Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative, BlackRock is classifying Ethereum as a key platform. It also means that BlackRock is not simply investing in a token. Instead, it is actively validating Ethereum’s role as the world’s leading financial ledger for tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWAs). The company must have acquired $28.78 million worth of ETH to support its growing digital products, particularly the BUIDL fund. Especially since this fund operates entirely on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, running such a large on-chain product requires BlackRock to maintain a deep, continuous supply of Ethereum’s native gas – ETH. According to Arkham Intelligence data, BlackRock now holds a massive position of 3,944,794 ETH – Making it the third-largest holder globally after the Eth2 Beacon Deposit Contract and Binance. This institutional focus is juxtaposed against the aggressive accumulation strategy of corporate treasuries like BitMine Immersion. The firm, which is the world’s largest Ethereum treasury, recently added 69,822 ETH. In doing so, it boosted its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, while hitting 60% of its “Alchemy of 5%” supply target. Meanwhile, on the price front, ETH was trading near $3,123.46 on the charts. This, after a minor downtick at press time. However, the momentary price action may have been overshadowed by the long-term bullish sentiment fueled by these institutional moves. BlackRock recently made news for its latest buy-in, confirming that Ethereum is evolving as the active foundation for mainstream, on-chain finance. The simultaneous on-chain movement of $589 million in BTC and ETH (received from Coinbase) does not reflect a “market flush.” Instead, ETF redemption mechanics directly drive these transfers. These large transfers, even with BTC near $90,898 and ETH above $3,000 at press time, reveal a key truth. They show that visible crypto movements often represent capital exiting the ETF system, rather than entering it. This resulting market volatility does not signal weakness. On the contrary, they highlights how crypto is transitioning into a mature, institutionally-plumbed financial system.

Title: Will Solana’s price hit $500 after Vanguard’s SOL ETF decision?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=551463
Time Published: 2025-12-06T01:00:43Z
Full Content:
Vanguard’s SOL ETF – Betting on fundamentals amid volatility? With back-to-back ETFs, the crypto market is entering one of its most aggressive adoption phases yet. Notably, this momentum isn’t limited to Bitcoin [BTC]. Instead, institutions are finally diversifying into altcoins too. Even without a confirmed “altcoin season,” the data has been seeing steady institutional demand. Solana [SOL] is leading the charge, having rolled out six spot SOL ETFs in Q4 and pulled in about $622 million in inflows so far. Notably, almost 95% of that capital has gone into Bitwise’s BSOL ETF, effectively positioning it as the BlackRock-tier heavyweight of the Solana ecosystem. In short, 2025 has finally brought altcoins into the spotlight. Source: Farside Investors Building on this momentum is Vanguard Group. For context, Vanguard is one of the world’s largest asset managers, managing over $11 trillion and serving more than 50 million investors. In a significant policy shift, the firm has opened its platform to crypto ETFs. Announced on 02 December, this move reverses Vanguard’s long-held position against crypto ETFs. This is a clear nod towards growing institutional demand for crypto. Among top-caps, Solana is also part of the mix. Vanguard’s move to support a SOL ETF isn’t just bullish for Solana. Instead, it also highlights a broader shift in institutional focus toward altcoins. Until Q4 2025, Ethereum [ETH] was the only altcoin with Spot ETFs in the U.S. However, that’s changing fast. In this context, Vanguard’s adoption of SOL marks a turning point. Even former skeptics are starting to diversify into a market once considered too volatile. Given SOL’s price action, that caution is understandable though. Source: TradingView (SOL/USDT) Notably, this policy shift comes at a particularly volatile moment too. On the charts, Solana is still one of the “worst-performing assets” across multiple timeframes. In fact, zoomed out, SOL is down about 28% on the year – Marking its worst annual performance since the -95% drop in 2022. The weekly and daily charts tell a similar story. So, what exactly is Vanguard betting on? Looking at the price alone, the ROI isn’t compelling. So, is this move driven more by Solana’s fundamentals than by short-term gains? No doubt, Solana has lived up to its “Ethereum killer” tag. While price action hasn’t always reflected it, the fundamentals tell a different story. Notably, Chainspect data makes that clear, explaining why Vanguard’s bet on SOL matters. According to Chainspect, Solana’s scalability metrics revealed a 4.78% jump in real-time TPS [1H] to 798.5 txs/s and transaction finality at 12.8 seconds. This puts it among the most-efficient high-cap blockchains currently. Source: ChainSpect Against this setup, Vanguard’s bet on Solana clearly looks long-term. As a result, a $500-target (Roughly a 270% rally from SOL’s press time price) can’t be entirely ruled out. The upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, slated for Q1 2026, is expected to give Solana’s fundamentals an additional boost. Combined with growing institutional adoption, these developments will position SOL for potentially substantial upside over the coming year. Especially as improvements in scalability strengthen its long-term fundamentals.

Title: Sam Altman's Dirty DRAM Deal

Time Published: 2025-12-06T00:24:55Z

Home Videos Podcasts Articles GPU Chart Merchandise Support Us! More... Written by Tom of Moore’s Law Is Dead Special Assistance by KarbinCry & kari-no-sugata Based on this Video: https://youtu.be/BORRBce5TGw At the beginning of November, I ordered a 32GB DDR5 kit for pairing with a Minisforum BD790i X3D motherboard, and three weeks later those very same sticks of DDR5 are now listed for a staggering $330– a 156% increase in price from less than a month ago! At this rate, it seems likely that by Christmas, that DDR5 kit alone could be worth more than the entire Zen 4 X3D platform I planned to pair it with! How could this happen, and more specifically – how could this happen THIS quickly? Well, buckle up! I am about to tell you the story of Sam Altman’s Dirty DRAM Deal, or: How the AI bubble, panic, and unpreparedness stole Christmas... But before I dive in, let me make it clear that my RAM kit’s 156% jump in price isn’t a fluke or some extreme example of what's going on right now. Nope, and in fact, I'd like to provide two more examples of how how impossible it is becoming to get ahold of RAM - these were provided by a couple of our sources within the industry: One source that works at a US Retailer, stated that a RAM Manufacturer called them in order to inquire if they might buy RAM from them to stock up for their other customers. This would be like Corsair asking a Best Buy if they had any RAM around. Another source that works at a Prebuilt PC company, was recently given an estimate for when they would receive RAM orders if they placed them now…and they were told December…of 2026! So what happened? Well, it all comes down to three perfectly synergistic events: OpenAI executed two unprecedented RAM deals that took everyone by surprise. The secrecy and size of the deals triggered full-scale panic buying from everyone else. The market had almost zero safety stock left due to tariffs, worry about decreasing RAM prices over the summer, and stalled equipment transfers. Below, we’re going to walk through each of these factors — and then I’m going to warn you about which hardware categories will be hit the hardest, which products are already being cancelled, and what you should buy right now before the shelves turn into a repeat of 2021–2022...because this is doomed to turn into much more than just RAM scarcity... On October 1st OpenAI signed two simultaneous deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for 40% of the worlds DRAM supply. Now, did OpenAI’s competition suspect some big RAM deals could be signed in late 2025? Yes. Ok, but did they think it would be deals this huge and with multiple companies? NO! In fact, if you go back and read reporting on Sam Altman’s now infamous trip to South Korea on October 1st, even just mere hours before the massive deals with Samsung and SK Hynix were simultaneously signed – most reporting simply mentioned vague reports about Sam talking to Samsung, SK Hynix, TSMC, and Foxconn. But the reporting at the time was soft, almost dismissive — “exploring ties,” “seeking cooperation,” “probing for partnerships.” Nobody hinted that OpenAI was about to swallow up to 40% of global DRAM output – even on morning before it happened! Nobody saw this coming - this is clear in the lack of reporting about the deals before they were announced, and every MLID Source who works in DRAM manufacturing and distribution insist this took everyone in the industry by surprise. To be clear - the shock wasn’t that OpenAI made a big deal, no, it was that they made two massive deals this big, at the same time, with Samsung and SK Hynix simultaneously! In fact, according to our sources - both companies had no idea how big each other's deal was, nor how close to simultaneous they were. And this secrecy mattered. It mattered a lot. Had Samsung known SK Hynix was about to commit a similar chunk of supply — or vice-versa — the pricing and terms would have likely been different. It’s entirely conceivable they wouldn’t have both agreed to supply such a substantial part of global supply if they had known more...but at the end of the day - OpenAI did succeed in keeping the circles tight, locking down the NDAs, and leveraging the fact that these companies assumed the other wasn’t giving up this much wafer volume simultaneously…in order to make a surgical strike on the global RAM supply chain…and it's worked so far... Imagine you're running a hyper scaler, or maybe you’re a major OEM, or perhaps pretend that you are simply one of OpenAI’s chief competitors: On October 1st of 2025, you would have woken up to the news that OpenAI had just cornered the memory market more aggressively than any company in the last decade, and you hadn't heard even a murmur that this was coming beforehand! Well, you would probably make some follow-up calls to colleagues in the industry, and then also quickly hear rumors that it wasn't just you - also the two largest suppliers didn’t even see each other’s simultaneous cooperation with OpenAI coming either! You wouldn't go: “Well, that’s an interesting coincidence”, no, you would say: “WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON THAT WE DON’T KNOW ABOUT?” Again – it’s not the size of the deals that's solely the issue here, no, it’s also the unexpectedness and brazenness of them. On October 1st silicon valley executives and procurement managers panicked over concerns like these: What other deals don’t we know about? Is this just the first of many? None of our DRAM suppliers warned us ahead of time! We have to assume they also won't in the future, and that it’s possible all of global DRAM could be bought up without us getting a single warning! We know OpenAI’s competitors are already panic-buying! If we don’t move now, we might be locked out of the market until 2028! OpenAI’s competitors, OEMs, and cloud providers scrambled to secure whatever inventory remained out of self-defense, and self-defense in a world that was entirely defenseless due to the accelerant I’ll now explain in Part III... Normally, the DRAM market has buffers: warehouses of emergency stock, excess wafer starts, older DRAM manufacturing machinery being sold off to budget brands while the big brands upgrade their production lines…but not in 2025, in 2025 those would-be buffers were depleted for three separate reasons: Tariff Chaos. Companies had deliberately reduced how much DRAM they ordered for their safety stock over the summer of 2025 because tariffs were changing almost weekly. Every RAM purchase risked being made at the wrong moment – and so fewer purchases were made. Prices had been falling all summer. Because of the hesitancy to purchase as much safety stock as usual, RAM prices were also genuinely falling over time. And, obviously when memory is getting cheaper month over month, the last thing you’d feel is pressured to buy a commodity that could be cheaper the next month…so everyone waited. Secondary RAM Manufacturing Had Stalled. Budget brands normally buy older DRAM fabrication equipment from mega-producers like Samsung when Samsung upgrades their DRAM lines to the latest and greatest equipment. This allows the DRAM market to expand more than it would otherwise because it makes any upgrading of the fanciest production lines to still be additive change to the market. However, Korean memory firms have been terrified that reselling old equipment to China-adjacent OEMs might trigger U.S. retaliation…and so those machines have been sitting idle in warehouses since early spring. Yep, there was no cushion. OpenAI hit the market at the exact moment it was least prepared. And now time for the biggest twist of all, a twist that’s actually public information, and therefore should be getting discussed by far more people in this writer's opinion: OpenAI isn’t even bothering to buy finished memory modules! No, their deals are unprecedentedly only for raw wafers — uncut, unfinished, and not even allocated to a specific DRAM standard yet. It’s not even clear if they have decided yet on how or when they will finish them into RAM sticks or HBM! Right now it seems like these wafers will just be stockpiled in warehouses – like a kid who hides the toybox because they’re afraid nobody wants to play with them, and thus selfishly feels nobody but them should get the toys! And let’s just say it: Here is the uncomfortable truth Sam Altman is always loath to admit in interviews: OpenAI is worried about losing its lead. The last 18 months have seen competitors catching up fast — Anthropic, Meta, xAI, and specifically Google’s Gemini 3 has gotten a ton of praise just in the past week. Everyone’s chasing training capacity. Everyone needs memory. DRAM is the lifeblood of scaling inference and training throughput. Cutting supply to your rivals is not a conspiracy theory. It’s a business tactic as old as business itself. And so, when you consider how secretive OpenAI was about their deals with Samsung and SK Hynix, but additionally how unready they were to immediately utilize their warehouses of DRAM wafers – it sure seems like a primary goal of these deals was to deprive the market, and not just an attempt to protect OpenAI's own supply… Alright, now that we are done explaining the how, let’s get to the “now what?” – because even if the RAM shortage miraculously improves immediately behind the scenes – even if the AI Bubble instantly popped or 10 companies started tooling up for more DRAM capacity this second (and many are, to be fair), at a minimum the next six to nine months are already screwed. See above: DRAM manufactures are quoting 13-Month lead times for DDR5! This is not a temporary blip. This could be a once-in-a-generation shock. So what gets hit first? What gets hit hardest? Well, below is an E through S-Tier ranking of which products are "the most screwed": S-Tier (Already Screwed – Too Late to Buy) - RAM itself, obviously. RAM prices have “exploded”. The detonation is in the past. A-Tier (Almost Screwed – Don’t Wait to Buy!!!) SSDs. These tends to follow DRAM pricing with a lag. Small Prebuilt PC Companies. That lack large buffers of inventory. RADEON GPUs. AMD doesn’t bundle RAM in their BOM kits to AIBs the way Nvidia does. In fact, the RX 9070 GRE 16GB this channel leaked months ago is almost certainly cancelled according to our sources. XBOX. Microsoft didn’t plan. Prices may rise and/or supply may dwindle in 2026. B-Tier (Eventually Screwed – Don’t wait much longer to buy!) Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia maintains large memory inventories for its board partners, giving them a buffer. But high-capacity GPUs (like a hypothetical 24GB 5080 SUPER) are on ice for now because those stores were never sufficiently built up. In fact, Nvidia is quietly telling partners that their SUPER refresh “might” launch Q3 2026 – although most partners think it’s just a placeholder for when Nvidia expects new capacity to come online, and thus SUPER may never launch. C-Tier (Think about buying soon) Laptops and phones. These companies negotiate immense long-term contracts, so they’re not hit immediately. But once their stockpiles run dry, watch out! D-Tier (Consider buying soon, but there’s no rush) PlayStation. Sony planned better than almost anyone else. They bought aggressively during the summer price trough, which is why they can afford a Black Friday discount while everyone else is raising prices. E-Tier (Prices might actually drop) Anything without RAM. Specifically CPUs that do not come with coolers could see price drops over time since there could be a drop in demand for CPUs if nobody has the RAM to feed them in systems. ???-Tier —Steam Machine. Valve keeps things quiet, but the big unknown is whether they pre-bought RAM months ago before announcing their much-hyped Steam Machine. If they did already stockpile an ample supply of DDR5 - then Steam Machine should launch fine, but supply could dry up temporarily at some point while they wait for prices to drop. However, if they didn’t plan ahead - expect a high launch price and very little resupply…it might even need to be cancelled or there might need to be a variant offered without RAM included (BYO RAM Edition!). And that’s it! This last bit was the most important part of the article in this writer's opinion – an attempt at helping you avoid getting burned. Well, actually, there is one other important reason for this article’s existence I'll tack onto the end – a hope that other people start digging into what’s going on at OpenAI. I mean seriously – do we even have a single reliable audit of their financials to back up them outrageously spending this much money…for this? Heck, I’ve even heard from numerous sources that OpenAI is “buying up the manufacturing equipment as well” – and without mountains of concrete proof, and/or more input from additional sources on what that really means…I don’t feel I can touch that hot potato without getting burned…but I hope someone else will… Sources: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/openais-stargate-project-to-consume-up-to-40-percent-of-global-dram-output-inks-deal-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-the-tune-of-up-to-900-000-wafers-per-month https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-accelerate-advancements-in-global-ai-infrastructure https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ddr5/ai-led-dram-supply-crunch-reportedly-has-morgan-stanley-downgrading-major-oems-skyrocketing-memory-prices-could-erode-server-and-pc-margins https://wccftech.com/dram-prices-have-risen-by-a-whopping-172-this-year-alone/ https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1991255966235419112 https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WTMMnQ/corsair-vengeance-rgb-64-gb-2-x-32-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-cmh64gx5m2b6000c30?history_days=730 https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-is-knocking-100-off-ps5-consoles-for-black-friday-2025 https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-sk-hynix-halt-old-equipment-sales-over-fears-us-backlash-ft-reports-2024-03-12/ https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/samsung-and-sk-hynix-the-worlds-biggest-makers-of-dram-and-flash-memory-chips-have-potentially-lost-the-right-to-buy-us-equipment-for-use-in-their-china-based-factories/ https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/12/news-samsung-reportedly-expands-1c-dram-capacity-for-hbm4-targeting-60k-wafers-monthly-in-2025/ https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/01/news-openai-ceo-reportedly-meets-foxconn-tsmc-heads-to-korea-to-explore-samsung-sk-hynix-ties/?utm_source=chatgpt.com https://www.economist.com/business/2025/11/19/cracks-are-appearing-in-openais-dominant-facade?utm_source=chatgpt.com https://tech4gamers.com/ram-prices-increased/ https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/trump-tariffs-american-importers.html https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2025/11/12/companies-will-struggle-to-stay-on-top-of-tariff-chaos https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apple-aims-source-all-us-iphones-india-pivot-away-china-ft-reports-2025-04-25/ https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/03/india-us-tariffs-china-trump-foreign-policy.html https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2024 https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/nvidia-q3-updates-ai-bubble-fears-spotlight-2025-11-19/ https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2025/10/01/seoul-altman-ai-deal-samsung-sk-chips-data-centers/9291759343811/#google_vignette https://www.micron.com/products/memory?srsltid=AfmBOopdnGb80CSI2TU-hbQ6Ei33c2PJ-3ESQuxMk1FZrPrJjUwk8DQI https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/radeon-rx-9070-gre-16gb-rumor ©2019 by Moore's Law Is Dead.

Title: Layoff Rumors And Metaverse Cuts Push Meta Shares Higher—Details

Time Published: 2025-12-05T23:00:53Z

Meta Platforms Inc. shares climbed after reports that the company is weighing deep reductions to the budget behind its metaverse projects. Investors pushed the stock higher as traders reacted to the possibility that one of the company’s most costly bets could be scaled back. Based on reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, Meta is considering cuts of up to 30% to the unit that builds its virtual reality and metaverse products, a move tied to planning for the company’s 2026 budget. The change would mainly affect Reality Labs, the division that makes Quest headsets and Horizon virtual spaces. Reality Labs has posted heavy losses since 2020. Reports put the total at more than $60 billion and, by some counts, closer to $70 billion in cumulative losses over recent years. Those sums have kept pressure on management to rethink where the company puts its money. The market response was swift. Meta’s share price jumped roughly 4%, and some outlets calculated that the move added about $69 billion to the company’s market value as traders reacted positively to a pullback from costly metaverse spending. That reaction signals investors prefer money steered toward projects with clearer near-term returns. Reports have warned that the cuts could bring staff reductions inside Reality Labs, with layoffs possibly starting as early as January 2026. Company leaders reportedly discussed budget scenarios during recent planning meetings. Any job cuts would mark a sharp change after years of heavy investment in virtual reality and related software. At the same time, Meta has been moving money into artificial intelligence and related hardware. The company finalized a multibillion-dollar deal this year to take a large stake in Scale AI — a pact reported at roughly $14 billion for a near-half ownership — and then hired talent from that startup to help run a new AI effort. That tradeoff shows where Meta’s priorities now lie. For people who own or use Meta’s VR gear, this does not mean every project will end. But several initiatives could see slower progress and smaller teams. For rivals and suppliers in the AR/VR space, the cut may reshape who wins short-term device and platform business. Analysts say the move narrows one major uncertainty for Meta while opening another: how well the company can compete in AI after so many dollars flowed into virtual worlds.

Home » Artificial intelligence » XAI Grok 4.2 May Have Cracked the Code on Trading xAI Grok 4.20 created a 47% return in the Nasdaq and outperformed all others in the Alpha Arena competition. 32 instances of various LLMs (including multiple variants of the same model under different prompting strategies like “Situational Awareness,” “Monk Mode,” “Max Leverage,” and “New Baseline”) were each allocated $10,000 in real money to trade autonomously on the Nasdaq exchange. The total capital across all participants was $320,000. Models had to generate trading ideas, size positions, time entries/exits, and manage risk without human intervention, using only market data inputs. This lasted 2 weeks and focused on volatile tech stocks, including Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), Amazon (AMZN), and others. Grok 4.20 executed 105 trades and dominated the leaderboard, with its top instance (Situational Awareness strategy) achieving a +47% return (growing $10,000 to $14,698), with an aggregate return across its instances cited as approximately 12.11% (possibly an averaged or weighted figure).

I think buying and holding will still end up being the best way to grow investments if this turns out to be a reality once there is more long-term data. But, what I could see is a boon for prediction markets with LLMs being able to make at least semi-accurate predictions better than humans, based on being able to interpret vast amounts of information from different sources very quickly. Not for sports, but for other events such as weather, natural disasters, etc. Replying to myself, but the live stream actually did mention someone cleaning house on Polymarket which was exactly where my mind was going. The top 1% of American households owns around 30-31% of the total U.S. wealth, a share that has grown significantly over recent decades, while the bottom 50% holds a mere 2-3%. After the billionaire tech bros put most people out of work and take their share of the productivity gains, do you really think they will stop there? They will look around at who still has wealth, and look for ways to take control of that. Specifically share holders. AI gives them the power to manipulate the share market. With this they can accumulate even more of the wealth share. Also, most rich people see shareholders as an impediment. If AI can help them to retake full control of their businesses (Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft etc) then why would they not do that? After all every billionaire really wants to be a trillionaire. Communism was shown to be busted in the 20th century. Capitalism has been the most successful system so far but perhaps capitalism will cease to function in the 21st century, or perhaps it can be successfully modified? This means all those annoying traderobot ads targetting the inexperienced traders on the net are scams, Already, most trading is done by autonomous trading algorithms, trading in microseconds against each other, so much so that being physically close to the stock exchange is worth millions in electron proximity. Sometimes these programs exaggerate moves of a stock or even sector, especially volatile sectors like tech, but also small caps. In one famous instance, that also pointed to other less spectacular moves of the S&P index, a “Flash Crash” from the algorithms, resulted in several arrests: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_flash_crash “New regulations put in place following the 2010 flash crash[10] proved to be inadequate to protect investors in the August 24, 2015, flash crash — “when the price of many ETFs appeared to come unhinged from their underlying value”[10] — and ETFs were subsequently put under greater scrutiny by regulators and investors.[10] On April 21, 2015, nearly five years after the incident, the U.S. Department of Justice laid 22 criminal counts, including fraud and market manipulation, against Navinder Singh Sarao, a British financial trader. Among the charges included was the use of spoofing algorithms; just prior to the flash crash, he placed orders for thousands of E-mini S&P 500 stock index futures contracts which he planned on canceling later.[11] These orders amounting to about “$200 million worth of bets that the market would fall” were “replaced or modified 19,000 times” before they were canceled.[11] Spoofing, layering, and front running are now banned.[4] The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) investigation concluded that Sarao “was at least significantly responsible for the order imbalances” in the derivatives market which affected stock markets and exacerbated the flash crash.[11] Sarao began his alleged market manipulation in 2009 with commercially available trading software whose code he modified “so he could rapidly place and cancel orders automatically”.[11]” So, there are/were guardrails in place, but will they work against AI? Maybe more importantly, will a neutered SEC, CFTB, DOJ, and other agencies both in the U.S. and abroad be allowed to curb such activity? Trump’s administration has said no one should hinder the development of AI, and has been the most pro-crypto currency – a form of virtual speculation on something with no underlying value – administration in the world. Eventually, there should be enough AI competing against each other that they should cancel each other out; some will short the market/stocks too. using leverage that might bankrupt the company, sector and even potentially the entire banking sector – see: Long Term Capital Management in 1997: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management. This wasn’t AI but its sophisticated trading derivatives might have been similar to what AI could do in minutes instead of months. Faced with AI that’s too fast and unpredictable to keep up with, and tax and trading costs that whittle advantages down to nothing (what was the tax liability of these AI systems in the test?), the smartest thing for ordinary investors to do might be the oldest: Buy and Hold and index of top stocks. This was inevitable, it’s why I think their is zero chance the stock market exists in a few years, unless they globally institute massive changes, which will impact day traders the most. I think they will have to put limits in place on how fast you can buy or sell a stock, and a mandatory time of holding a stock (IE:24hrs). Comment

Title: Salesforce CEO Mulls Changing Name to AI-Flavored ‘Agentforce’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/salesforce-ceo-mulls-changing-name-to-ai-flavored-agentforce-2000696360
Time Published: 2025-12-05T22:25:34Z
Full Content:
Reading time 2 minutes Despite the fact that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff talks about AI nonstop, regularly chimes in on the AI news of the day, and endlessly pushes his company’s AI platform, he seems worried that people just aren’t associating Salesforce with AI. Luckily, he has a solution in mind, according to a report from Business Insider: changing the company’s entire name to Agentforce to evoke the AI agents that he’d like the company to be known for. While the suggestion of changing the company’s name was apparently raised in jest, Benioff took it seriously and told the publication that a new corporate name might be in the works. “That would not shock me,” he reportedly said, with an apparent preference for the name Agentforceâcurrently the name used by a number of the company’s AI-related services, including Agentforce Sales, Agentforce Service, and Agentforce 365 Platform. On one hand, Salesforce Agentforce Sales is pretty redundant, so there’s some logic in simplifying the naming convention. On the other hand, it’s hard not to get a whiff of the cryptocurrency goldrush era, where companies just started throwing the word “blockchain” into everything. Remember when Long Island Iced Tea Corporation changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation, a name that doesn’t even make sense, and saw its stock immediately skyrocket by over 400%? It feels like we’re not that far off from a situation similar to that. Salesforce, of course, would not be the first tech company to go through a rebrand. Google famously became Alphabet, Jack Dorsey’s Square changed to Block, Elon Musk renamed Twitter to X, and Michael Saylor changed Microstrategy’s moniker to Strategy as it became a bitcoin holding company. Notably, at least two of those are changes most people simply don’t acknowledge. But perhaps the most appropriate parallel for this particular change is Facebook rebranding to Meta in the midst of an effort to pivot the company into a new era where it would become the platform of the metaverse, an immersive virtual reality world where just about anything you could imagine is possible, including having legs. The dream of that particular reality is largely dead now, with Meta reportedlyÂ that it’ll likely have layoffs within its Reality Labs division and will shift away from the virtual world to build more AI products. And yet, the name sticks. That might be a fate Benioff should consider: if you go so far all-in on a single bet that you surrender your name to it, you might just be stuck with a reminder of that decision even if it fails.

Title: Perpetual Futures
URL: https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/perpetual-futures-explained/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T21:23:03Z
Full Content:
Programming note: Bits about Money is supported by our readers. I generally forecast about one issue a month, and haven't kept that pace that this year. As a result, I'm working on about 3-4 for December. Much financial innovation is in the ultimate service of the real economy. Then, we have our friends in crypto, who occasionally do intellectually interesting things which do not have a locus in the real economy. One of those things is perpetual futures (hereafter, perps), which I find fascinating and worthy of study, the same way that a virologist just loves geeking out about furin cleavage sites. You may have read a lot about stablecoins recently. I may write about them (again; see past BAM issue) in the future, as there has in recent years been some uptake of them for payments. But it is useful to understand that a plurality of stablecoins collateralize perps. Some observers are occasionally strategic in whether they acknowledge this, but for payments use cases, it does not require a lot of stock to facilitate massive flows. And so of the $300 billion or so in stablecoins presently outstanding, about a quarter sit on exchanges. The majority of that is collateralizing perp positions. Perps are the dominant way crypto trades, in terms of volume. (It bounces around but is typically 6-8 times larger than spot.) This is similar to most traditional markets: where derivatives are available, derivative volume swamps spot volume. The degree to which depends on the market, Schelling points, user culture, and similar. For example, in India, most retail investing in equity is actually through derivatives; this is not true of the U.S. In the U.S., most retail equity exposure is through the spot market, directly holding stocks or indirectly through ETFs or mutual funds. Most trading volume of the stock indexes, however, is via derivatives. The large crypto exchanges are primarily casinos, who use the crypto markets as a source of numbers, in the same way a traditional casino might use a roulette wheel or set of dice. The function of a casino is for a patron to enter it with money and, statistically speaking, exit it with less. Physical casinos are often huge capital investments with large ongoing costs, including the return on that speculative capital. If they could choose to be less capital intensive, they would do so, but they are partially constrained by market forces and partially by regulation. A crypto exchange is also capital intensive, not because the website or API took much investment (relatively low, by the standards of financial software) and not because they have a physical plant, but because trust is expensive. Bettors, and the more sophisticated market makers, who are the primary source of action for bettors, need to trust that the casino will actually be able to pay out winnings. That means the casino needs to keep assets (generally, mostly crypto, but including a smattering of cash for those casinos which are anomalously well-regarded by the financial industry) on hand exceeding customer account balances. Those assets are… sitting there, doing nothing productive. And there is an implicit cost of capital associated with them, whether nominal (and borne by a gambler) or material (and borne by a sophisticated market making firm, crypto exchange, or the crypto exchange’s affiliate which trades against customers [0]). Perpetual futures exist to provide the risk gamblers seek while decreasing the total capital requirement (shared by the exchange and market makers) to profitably run the enterprise. In the commodities futures markets, you can contract to either buy or sell some standardized, valuable thing at a defined time in the future. The overwhelming majority of contracts do not result in taking delivery; they’re cancelled by an offsetting contract before that specified date. Given that speculation and hedging are such core use cases for futures, the financial industry introduced a refinement: cash-settled futures. Now there is a reference price for the valuable thing, with a great deal of intellectual effort put into making that reference price robust and fair (not always successfully). Instead of someone notionally taking physical delivery of pork bellies or barrels of oil, people who are net short the future pay people who are net long the future on delivery day. (The mechanisms of this clearing are fascinating but outside today’s scope.) Back in the early nineties economist Robert Shiller proposed a refinement to cash settled futures: if you don’t actually want pork bellies or oil barrels for consumption in April, and we accept that almost no futures participants actually do, why bother closing out the contracts in April? Why fragment the liquidity for contracts between April, May, June, etc? Just keep the market going perpetually. This achieved its first widespread popular use in crypto (Bitmex is generally credited as being the popularizer), and hereafter we’ll describe the standard crypto implementation. There are, of course, variations available. Instead of all of a particular futures vintage settling on the same day, perps settle multiple times a day for a particular market on a particular exchange. The mechanism for this is the funding rate. At a high level: winners get paid by losers every e.g. 4 hours and then the game continues, unless you’ve been blown out due to becoming overleveraged or for other reasons (discussed in a moment). Consider a toy example: a retail user buys 0.1 Bitcoin via a perp. The price on their screen, which they understand to be for Bitcoin, might be $86,000 each, and so they might pay $8,600 cash. Should the price rise to $90,000 before the next settlement, they will get +/- $400 of winnings credited to their account, and their account will continue to reflect exposure to 0.1 units of Bitcoin via the perp. They might choose to sell their future at this point (or any other). They’ll have paid one commission (and a spread) to buy, one (of each) to sell, and perhaps they’ll leave the casino with their winnings, or perhaps they’ll play another game. Where did the money come from? Someone else was symmetrically short exposure to Bitcoin via a perp. It is, with some very important caveats incoming, a closed system: since no good or service is being produced except the speculation, winning money means someone else lost. One fun wrinkle for funding rates: some exchanges cap the amount the rate can be for a single settlement period. This is similar in intent to traditional markets’ usage of circuit breakers: designed to automatically blunt out-of-control feedback loops. It is dissimilar in that it cannot actually break circuits: changes to funding rate can delay realization of losses but can’t prevent them, since they don’t prevent the realization of symmetrical gains. Perp funding rates also embed an interest rate component. This might get quoted as 3 bps a day, or 1 bps every eight hours, or similar. However, because of the impact of leverage, gamblers are paying more than you might expect: at 10X leverage that’s 30 bps a day. Consumer finance legislation standardizes borrowing costs as APR rather than basis points per day so that an unscrupulous lender can’t bury a 200% APR in the fine print. Prices for perps do not, as a fact of nature, exactly match the underlying. That is a feature for some users. In general, when the market is exuberant, the perp will trade above spot (the underlying market). To close the gap, a sophisticated market participant should do the basis trade: make offsetting trades in perps and spot (short the perp and buy spot, here, in equal size). Because the funding rate is set against a reference price for the underlying, longs will be paying shorts more (as a percentage of the perp’s current market price). For some of them, that’s fine: the price of gambling went up, oh well. For others, that’s a market incentive to close out the long position, which involves selling it, which will decrease the price at the margin (in the direction of spot). The market maker can wait for price convergence; if it happens, they can close the trade at a profit, while having been paid to maintain the trade. If the perp continues to trade rich, they can just continue getting the increased funding cost. To the extent this is higher than their own cost of capital, this can be extremely lucrative. Flip the polarities of these to understand the other direction. The basis trade, classically executed, is delta neutral: one isn’t exposed to the underlying itself. You don’t need any belief in Bitcoin’s future adoption story, fundamentals, market sentiment, halvings, none of that. You’re getting paid to provide the gambling environment, including a really important feature: the perp price needs to stay reasonably close to the spot price, close enough to continue attracting people who want to gamble. You are also renting access to your capital for leverage. You are also underwriting the exchange: if they blow up, your collateral becoming a claim against the bankruptcy estate is the happy scenario. (As one motivating example: Galois Capital, a crypto hedge fund doing basis trades, had ~40% of its assets on FTX when it went down. They then wound down the fund, selling the bankruptcy claim for 16 cents on the dollar.) Recall that the market can’t function without a system of trust saying that someone is good for it if a bettor wins. Here, the market maker is good for it, via the collateral it kept on the exchange. Many market makers function across many different crypto exchanges. This is one reason they’re so interested in capital efficiency: fully collateralizing all potential positions they could take across the universe of venues they trade on would be prohibitively capital intensive, and if they do not pre-deploy capital, they miss profitable trading opportunities. [1] Gamblers like risk; it amps up the fun. Since one has many casinos to choose from in crypto, the ones which only “regular” exposure to Bitcoin (via spot or perps) would be offering a less-fun product for many users than the ones which offer leverage. How much leverage? More leverage is always the answer to that question, until predictable consequences start happening. In a standard U.S. brokerage account, Regulation T has, for almost 100 years now, set maximum leverage limits (by setting minimums for margins). These are 2X at position opening time and 4X “maintenance” (before one closes out the position). Your brokerage would be obligated to forcibly close your position if volatility causes you to exceed those limits. As a simplified example, if you have $50k of cash, you’d be allowed to buy $100k of stock. You now have $50k of equity and a $50k loan: 2x leverage. Should the value of that stock decline to about $67k, you still owe the $50k loan, and so only have $17k remaining equity. You’re now on the precipice of being 4X leveraged, and should expect a margin call very soon, if your broker hasn’t “blown you out of the trade” already. What part of that is relevant to crypto? For the moment, just focus on that number: 4X. Perps are offered at 1X (non-levered exposure). But they’re routinely offered at 20X, 50X, and 100X. SBF, during his press tour / regulatory blitz about being a responsible financial magnate fleecing the customers in an orderly fashion, voluntarily self-limited FTX to 20X. One reason perps are structurally better for exchanges and market makers is that they simplify the business of blowing out leveraged traders. The exact mechanics depend on the exchange, the amount, etc, but generally speaking you can either force the customer to enter a closing trade or you can assign their position to someone willing to bear the risk in return for a discount. Blowing out losing traders is lucrative for exchanges except when it catastrophically isn’t. It is a priced service in many places. The price is quoted to be low (“a nominal fee of 0.5%” is one way Binance describes it) but, since it is calculated from the amount at risk, it can be a large portion of the money lost. If the account’s negative balance is less than the liquidation fee, wonderful, thanks for playing and the exchange / “the insurance fund” keeps the rest, as a tip. In the case where the amount an account is negative by is more than the fee, that “insurance fund” can choose to pay the winners on behalf of the liquidated user, at management’s discretion. Management will usually decide to do this, because a casino with a reputation for not paying winners will not long remain a casino. But tail risk is a real thing. The capital efficiency has a price: there physically does not exist enough money in the system to pay all winners given sufficiently dramatic price moves. Forced liquidations happen. Sophisticated participants withdraw liquidity (for reasons we’ll soon discuss) or the exchange becomes overwhelmed technically / operationally. The forced liquidations eat through the diminished / unreplenished liquidity in the book, and the magnitude of the move increases. Then crypto gets reminded about automatic deleveraging (ADL), a detail to perp contracts that few participants understand. (Pray we do not alter them further.) Risk in perps has to be symmetric: if (accounting for leverage) there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure long, then there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure short. This does not imply that the shorts or longs are sufficiently capitalized to actually pay for all the exposure in all instances. In cases where management deems paying winners from the insurance fund would be too costly and/or impossible, they automatically deleverage some winners. In theory, there is a published process for doing this, because it would be confidence-costing to ADL non-affiliated accounts but pay out affiliated accounts, one’s friends or particularly important counterparties, etc. In theory. In theory, one likely ADLs accounts which were quite levered before ones which were less levered, and one ADLs accounts which had high profits before ones with lower profits. In theory. [2] So perhaps you understood, prior to a 20% move, that you were 4X leveraged. You just earned 80%, right? Ah, except you were only 2X leveraged, so you earned 40%. Why were you retroactively only 2X? That’s what automatic deleveraging means. Why couldn’t you get the other 40% you feel entitled to? Because the collective group of losers doesn’t have enough to pay you your winnings and the insurance fund was insufficient or deemed insufficient by management. ADL is particularly painful for sophisticated market participants doing e.g. a basis trade, because they thought e.g. they were 100 units short via perps and 100 units long somewhere else via spot. If it turns out they were actually 50 units short via perps, but 100 units long, their net exposure is +50 units, and they have very possibly just gotten absolutely shellacked. In theory, this can happen to the upside or the downside. In practice in crypto, this seems to usually happen after sharp decreases in prices, not sharp increases. For example, October 2025 saw widespread ADLing as (more than) $19 billion of liquidations happened, across a variety of assets. Alameda’s CEO Caroline Ellison testified that they lost over $100 million during the collapse of Terra’s stablecoin in 2022, but since FTX’s insurance fund was made up; when leveraged traders lost money, their positions were frequently taken up by Alameda. That was quite lucrative much of the time, but catastrophically expensive during e.g. the Terra blowup. Alameda was a good loser and paid the winners, though: with other customers’ assets that they “borrowed.” In the traditional markets, if one’s brokerage deems one’s assets are unlikely to be able to cover the margin loan from the brokerage one has used, one’s brokerage will issue a margin call. Historically that gave one a relatively short period (typically, a few days) to post additional collateral, either by moving in cash, by transferring assets from another brokerage, or by experiencing appreciation in the value of one’s assets. Brokerages have the option, and in some cases the requirement, to manage risk after or during a margin call by forcing trades on behalf of the customer to close positions. It sometimes surprises crypto natives that, in the case where one’s brokerage account goes negative and all assets are sold, with a negative remaining balance, the traditional markets largely still expect you to pay that balance. This contrasts with crypto, where the market expectation for many years was that the customer was Daffy Duck with a gmail address and a pseudonymous set of numbered accounts recorded on a blockchain, and dunning them was a waste of time. Crypto exchanges have mostly, in the intervening years, either stepped up their game regarding KYC or pretended to do so, but the market expectation is still that a defaulting user will basically never successfully recover. (Note that the legal obligation to pay is not coextensive with users actually paying. The retail speculators with $25,000 of capital that the pattern day trade rules are worried about will often not have $5,000 to cover a deficiency. On the other end of the scale, when a hedge fund blows up, the fund entity is wiped out, but its limited partners—pension funds, endowments, family offices—are not on the hook to the prime broker, and nobody expects the general partner to start selling their house to make up the difference.) So who bears the loss when the customer doesn’t, can’t, or won’t? The waterfall depends on market, product type, and geography, but as a sketch: brokerages bear the loss first, out of their own capital. They’re generally required to keep a reserve for this purpose. A brokerage will, in the ordinary course of business, have obligations to other parties which would be endangered if they were catastrophically mismanaged and could not successfully manage risk during a downturn. (It’s been known to happen, and even can be associated with assets rather than liabilities.) In this case, most of those counterparties are partially insulated by structures designed to insure the peer group. These include e.g. clearing pools, guaranty funds capitalized by the member firms of a clearinghouse, the clearinghouse’s own capital, and perhaps mutualized insurance pools. That is the rough ordering of the waterfall, which varies depending geography/product/market. One can imagine a true catastrophe which burns through each of those layers of protection, and in that case, the clearinghouse might be forced to assess members or allocate losses across survivors. That would be a very, very bad day, but contracts exist to be followed on very bad days. One commonality with crypto, though: this system is also not fully capitalized against all possible events at all times. Unlike crypto, which for contingent reasons pays some lip service to being averse to credit even as it embraces leveraged trading, the traditional industry relies extensively on underwriting risk of various participants. Many crypto advocates believe that they have something which the traditional finance industry desperately needs. Perps are crypto’s most popular and lucrative product, but they probably won’t be adopted materially in traditional markets. Existing derivatives products already work reasonably well at solving the cost of capital issue. Liquidations are not the business model of traditional brokerages. And learning, on a day when markets are 20% down, that you might be hedged or you might be bankrupt, is not a prospect which fills traditional finance professionals with the warm fuzzies. And now you understand the crypto markets a bit better. [0] Brokers trading with their own customers can happen in the ordinary course of business, but has been progressively discouraged in traditional finance, as it enables frontrunning. Frontrunning, while it is understood in the popular parlance to mean “trading before someone else can trade” and often brought up in discussions of high frequency trading using very fast computers, does not historically mean that. It historically describes a single abusive practice: a broker could basically use the slowness of traditional financial IT systems to give conditional post-facto treatment to customer orders, taking the other side of them (if profitable) or not (if not). Frontrunning basically disappeared because customers now get order confirms almost instantly by computer not at end of day via a phone call. The confirm has the price the trade executed at on it. In classic frontrunning, you sent the customer’s order to the market (at some price X), waited a bit, and then observed a later price Y. If Y was worse for the customer than X, well, them’s the breaks on Wall Street. If Y was better, you congratulated the customer on their investing acumen, and informed them that they had successfully transacted at Z, a price of your choosing between X and Y. You then fraudulently inserted a recorded transaction between the customer and yourself earlier in the day, at price Z, and assigned the transaction which happened at X to your own account, not to the customer’s account. Frontrunning was a lucrative scam while it lasted, because (effectively) the customer takes 100% of the risk of the trade but the broker gets any percentage they want of the first day’s profits. This is potentially so lucrative that smart money (and some investors in his funds!) thought Madoff was doing it, thus generating the better-than-market stable returns for over a decade through malfeasance. Of frontrunning Madoff was entirely innocent. Some more principled crypto participants have attempted to discourage exchanges from trading with their own customers. They have mostly been unsuccessful: Merit Peak Limited is Binance’s captive entity which does this. It also is occasionally described by U.S. federal agencies as running a sideline in money laundering, Alameda Research was FTX’s affiliated trading fund. Their management was criminally convicted of money laundering. etc, etc. One of the reasons this behavior is so adaptive is because the billions of dollars sloshing around can be described to banks as “proprietary trading” and “running an OTC desk”, and an inattentive bank (like, say, Silvergate, as recounted here) might miss the customer fund flows they would have been formally unwilling to facilitate. This is a useful feature for sophisticated crypto participants, and so some of them do not draw attention to the elephant in the room, even though it is averse to their interests. [1] Not all crypto trades are pre-funded. Crypto OTC transactions sometimes settle on T+1, with the OTC desk essentially extending credit in the fashion that a prime broker would in traditional markets. But most transactions on exchanges have to be paid immediately in cash already at the venue. This is very different from traditional equity market structure, where venues don’t typically receive funds flow at all, and settling/clearing happens after the fact, generally by a day or two. [2] I note, for the benefit of readers of footnote 0, that there is often a substantial gap between the time when market dislocation happens and when a trader is informed they were ADLed. The implications of this are left as an exercise to the reader. I write about the intersection of tech and finance, approximately biweekly. It's free.

Title: 'Get all that Hermes stuff now': Netflix director accused of $11 million fraud rushed to buy luxury goods, texts show

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After Carl Rinsch got an infusion of $11 million from Netflix to finish his passion project — a futuristic television series — he could sleep well at night. That's partly because he bought a $439,000 handmade mattress on what prosecutors say was on Netflix's dime. At Rinsch's criminal fraud trial in Manhattan federal court on Friday, jurors heard more about the director's spending spree from some of the people who witnessed it firsthand. His former personal assistant testified that he compared himself to a character in a movie who had 30 days to spend $30 million — or lose it all. Prosecutors also called to the stand a salesman who waxed on about the handmade Swedish mattress he sold Rinsch, complete with a "sleep doctor" to massage it for him. Rinsch liked the Hästens Grand Vividus mattress so much that he decided to buy a second one, the salesperson testified Friday. Prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York allege Rinsch defrauded Netflix by misusing funds for the production of "White Horse" — a show about artificial beings who create their own society on Earth after a schism with humankind. Rinsch filmed portions of "White Horse," but went over budget and never finished a single episode. On Friday, jurors heard more testimony from Maria Skotnikova, who worked as a personal assistant for Rinsch and made logistical arrangements for the filming of "White Horse." Skotnikova said Rinsch made multiple luxury purchases after Netflix gave him an additional $11 million in March 2020 to finish the project, including a rush to buy Hermes goods. "Get all that Hermes stuff now," Rinsch told Skotnikova in one August 2021 text message sent to the jury. "This is your job," he texted her a short while later. "We have to do this. Or else the money goes bye-bye. Get it." According to Skotnikova, Rinsch compared his situation to "Brewster's Millions" — the 1985 movie about a man who learns he received a $30 million windfall from a family member but must spend it all within 30 days. Skotnikova also testified Thursday about driving to meetings in Ferraris and Rolls-Royces, vehicles an FBI forensic accountant said Rinsch purchased using money that originally came from Netflix. Skotnikova said Friday that Rinsch tried to purchase a large amount of furniture from the French designer Jacques Adnet, which he considered "interesting and underappreciated." Rinsch, known for directing "Ronin 47" with Keanu Reeves, wanted to have a "monopoly" on the designer's furniture pieces so he could "control the price," Skotnikova testified. The spending spree also included over 480 food takeout orders on Postmates and Uber Eats in a six-month span in 2022. The FBI forensic accountant previously testified that Rinsch moved the funds from Netflix through different accounts, invested a portion of it in the stock market and cryptocurrency, and spent other amounts on what appeared to be personal uses. Later Friday, jurors heard from Johan Ericsson, who served as the top Hästens salesperson on the West Coast of the US. He said he met Rinsch in 2021, when the director went to the brand's Los Angeles store. Rinsch purchased four mattresses for a total of $617,610.66, records show. He received a discount because he bought floor models rather than having them individually handmade in Sweden, Ericsson said. The highlight was the Grand Vividus in the "black shadow" colorway. It was the top-of-the-line model that took over 700 hours to make, Ericsson said. The Grand Vividus is not just a mattress, but a "sleep instrument" that includes a base and leather headboard, and comes with a "bed doctor" who visits your house to massage the mattress, according to Ericsson. Rinsch was so pleased with it that he later modified his order to get an additional Grand Vividus mattress rather than three lesser Hästens models, according to Ericsson. "These are two very special beds," Ericsson said. US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who is overseeing the trial, chastised prosecutors for allowing Ericsson to spend so much time on the witness stand waxing lyrical about the qualities of Hästens mattresses. "I was going to call it a sales pitch, but he obviously deeply believes in the brilliance of these mattresses," Rakoff said. Ericsson said that Rinsch never spoke with him about using the mattresses for the production of "White Horse." Rinsch's defense lawyers say he's innocent, and the case is really about a "creative genius" who was overwhelmed by the challenges of the project and didn't get the support he needed from Netflix. In a deposition for a separate legal proceeding, which was entered into evidence in the criminal trial, Rinsch was asked why he purchased "a mattress that costs $450,000 for this production." "Because it retains value," Rinsch said. "And a mattress that you spend $30,000 on is worth zilch, but a mattress that you spend $450,000 on — guess what? It's worth a hundred grand more now. So hey, what are you gonna do?" Prosecutors told Rakoff they expect to finish presenting their case on Monday. Rinsch — an engaged and jittery presence in the courtroom — hasn't said whether he will take the witness stand while his lawyers present his defense case. Jump to

Title: Netflix Deal for Warner Bros. Pushes Global M&A Toward 2021 Peak

(Bloomberg) -- Global mergers and acquisitions are on pace for their best year since 2021, as a spate of late-year deals pushes deal volumes to well over $3 trillion. Netflix Inc.’s $72 billion pact for Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., the year’s biggest acquisition including debt, underscores how corporate titans are swinging for bold, game-changing M&A under the deal-friendly Trump administration. Dealmakers are betting that they have a once-in-a-generation chance to usher through their dream deals with little or minimal pushback from antitrust regulators. Companies have been able to tap record-breaking financing packages, including Netflix’s loan of $59 billion, which would rank among the biggest of its type. That thinking also helped foster Kimberly-Clark Corp.’s $40 billion deal for Tylenol-maker Kenvue Inc. in November and the BlackRock Inc.-led purchase of Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion in October. Then there’s Union Pacific Corp.’s deal for railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp. for more than $80 billion including debt in July, a transaction that would have been unimaginable under the previous administration. As of Thursday, global M&A volumes for the year stood at $3.3 trillion, up 37% from 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That puts 2025 on track to have the best year for dealmaking since 2021, when there were $3.8 trillion in transactions announced. The increase is even sharper in the US, where deals for companies based in the country are up 53% to almost $1.8 trillion, just short of the 2021 high-water mark, the data show. In addition to 32 deals topping $10 billion this year, the US totals have been driven by almost 300 deals of $1 billion or more. Those included transactions such as Friday’s almost $4.8 billion acquisition of industrial equipment maker SPX Flow Inc. by ITT Inc., which confirmed a Bloomberg News report. The enterprise value of the Netflix deal totals about $82.7 billion. The transaction, which also confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report on the deal being imminent, comes as Wall Street advisers and their clients dash to wrap up deals before the traditional holiday slowdown period.

Title: When Positivity Turns Toxic: How Cultures That Silence Dissent Lose Their Edge
URL: https://observer.com/2025/12/toxic-positivity-leadership-workplace-culture/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T20:15:19Z
Full Content:
In his book Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More, historian Alexei Yurchak introduced the concept of “hypernormalization.” This describes a phenomenon in which an entire population accepts an officially sanctioned version of truth that fundamentally contradicts their lived reality. This emerged during the post-Stalin, pre-Perestroika Soviet era and was, in effect, gaslighting at a societal scale. A similar dynamic has taken hold inside many contemporary organizations, from Uber to Theranos, BrewDog to Careem, where the unrelenting, top-down insistence on happiness and positivity bears little resemblance to employees’ actual experiences in the workplace. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. A series of scandals, whistleblowing cases and public testimonies by employees at these companies illustrate what can go wrong when bosses oversell the good times and their positivity turns toxic. At Uber, for example, a sexual harassment case highlighted the stark discrepancy between the company’s espoused values and the behavior of senior leadership. At BrewDog, an open letter from former employees shed light on a stressful and fear-driven workplace culture that contradicted the utopian vision of the company and its operations promoted by its founders on social media. The core issue with organizations that demand positivity, either as a core tenet of their internal culture or as an essential mode of interacting with their customers, is that it creates a false illusion. Whatever its origins, over time, the enforced positivity becomes misguided, brittle and artificial. Employees are required to see, hear and speak no evil, while their emotional labor is translated into inauthentic performance. Doubts, frustrations and legitimate concerns are suppressed because they fail to align with the preferred narrative of how things are “supposed” to feel. Which is not to say such traits disappear. Instead, they become part of what psychologist Carl Jung called “the Shadow,” the accumulated, disowned aspects of self and system waiting for an outlet, often surfacing in ways that are corrosive and destabilizing. Far from building resilience and cohesion, then, forced optimism erodes any sense of psychological safety, leaving employees fatigued, cynical and disengaged. Performing and projecting positivity that bears no resemblance to reality is both draining and demoralizing. Amazon has long marketed itself as an upbeat company, the bringer of joy, with its ubiquitous smile logo. What its administrative personnel have witnessed in recent years, though, tells a very different story. For all the wellness programs, Mental Health America awards, and counseling opportunities made available to employees and their households, there has been a groundswell of discontent as people have adapted to post-pandemic realities. The company’s mandate requiring employees to return to the office three days per week was far from popular. Many employees had adapted well to working from home, appreciating the flexibility and work-life balance remote work afforded them. They remained unconvinced by leadership’s arguments about the benefits of physical proximity and face-to-face interaction with colleagues. Tensions escalated when rumors circulated that Amazon was preparing to extend the policy to a required five in-office days by 2025. Insights from TeamBlind’s poll of 2,585 verified Amazon employees illustrate the disconnect: 91 percent reported dissatisfaction with the return-to-office mandate, and 73 percent said they were considering leaving the company because of the change. A far from positive reaction saw some employees taking to the streets in protest, echoing earlier walkouts during the 2023 mass layoffs. More cuts followed, as Amazon pursued both bureaucratic efficiency and its rollout of generative A.I. Yet even in the Amazon case, employees felt able, if only partially, to voice their frustrations publicly. As Megan Reitz and John Higgins highlight in Speak Out, Listen Up, leaders are often unaware of how their own status and the workplace cultures they create discourage dissent, closing down discussion. Where negativity is stigmatized, there is little opportunity for challenge, debate, risk escalation or alternative thinking. Many find that when they do speak up—and certainly when they whistle blow—they are subsequently ostracized not only by senior leaders but by colleagues they were once close to as well. This pattern has repeatedly surfaced in scandals involving Uber, Theranos and Boeing. None of this is to suggest that constant criticism or unfettered negativity produces healthy cultures, and can be as toxic as forced positivity. For all the advocacy of psychological safety in recent years, there is a need for nuance and balance—it does not mean an absence of discomfort. As Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic argues in Don’t Be Yourself, performance pressure, friction and critical feedback all have their place and can be adapted to suit interactions with different employees. Effective leaders know when to deploy positivity as motivation and when to lean into constructive tension. After all, creative friction has fueled some of the world’s most significant breakthroughs. Without it, many transformative ideas would have never survived. The challenge—and the opportunity—is finding a middle ground between toxic positivity and unchecked venting. Healthy cultures make room for candor, dissent and complexity. They treat discomfort as information, not insubordination. They recognize that negativity, when expressed constructively, is not a threat but a necessary catalyst for progress.

Nearing the halfway point and festive mid-season break, the top flight of the Energia All-Ireland League is starting to take shape. The next two rounds could go a long way toward determining whether there will be a breakaway group atop the table. Going into the weekend’s fixtures, Lansdowne had opened up a five-point gap on Ballynahinch in fifth, by dint of last week’s 18-10 win which denied the Ulstermen even a bonus point. Hence, after three fifth-placed finishes in a row, ‘Hinch host leaders St Mary’s acutely mindful of not falling adrift of the leading quartet. The home side retain key men such as Ulster duo Marcus Rea, who shifts to number eight, and outhalf James Humphreys, as well as Conor Rankin and Aaron Sexton. They also appear strengthened by the return of hooker Zack McCall, ex-captain Bradley Lumey and former Irish Under-20 backrower Reuben Crothers. Then again, St Mary’s are flying high and welcome back hugely influential outhalf Conor Dean after he was rested for last week’s big win at home to Nenagh. The meeting of Terenure and Young Munster also looks significant in the playoff picture. Young Munster, who did the double over Terenure last season, sit an unlucky eighth. They have slipped 12 points off their hosts, who are third, after last week’s sixth one-score defeat of the season in their epic derby with Cork Con. Hubert Gilvarry’s hat-trick took his tally to eight tries in seven games, making the Sligo man the division’s leading try scorer. Ger Slattery shifts Munster’s Shay McCarthy to the other wing in a reshuffle and, adding to the attacking talent out wide in this game, Leinster’s Joshua Kenny makes his long-awaited debut for Terenure. Carlos Spencer also promotes Austrian-born outhalf Caspar Gabriel in a reshuffled backline and welcomes back Leinster hooker John McKee after last week’s loss in Clontarf. Cork Con and Old Belvedere renew acquaintances at Temple Hill for the first time in eight years, both sitting mid-table with identical records and both needing a win to stay within sight of the frontrunners. After last week’s big win over UCD, Old Belvedere welcome back Josh Ericson at number eight following his debut for Leinster last week. At the bottom of the table, Nenagh Ormond look to have a daunting task as they continue to search for their first points of the season at home to Clontarf. The champions make their first visit to Tipperary on the back of six successive wins and growing momentum. Nenagh have picked a new backrow and have shuffled their backline, with the 41-year-old player-coach Derek Corcoran starting at outhalf. ‘Tarf are without Jordan Coughlan, but their injuries in midfield are offset by the return of Hugh Cooney, as well as Leinster prop Alex Usanov.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg rebranded Facebook for the metaverse. Four years and $70 billion in losses later, he’s moving on
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/05/mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-layoffs-cuts-facebook-rebrand/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T17:52:44Z
Full Content:
In 2021, Mark Zuckerberg recast Facebook as Meta and declared the metaverse—a digital realm where people would work, socialize, and spend much of their lives—the company’s next great frontier. He framed it as the “successor to the mobile internet” and said Meta would be “metaverse-first.”The hype wasn’t all him. Grayscale, the investment firm specializing in crypto, called the metaverse a “trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.” Barbados even opened up an embassy in Decentraland, one of the worlds in the metaverse. Almost five years later, that bet has become one of the most expensive misadventures in tech. Meta’s Reality Labs division has racked up more than $70 billion in losses since 2021, according to Bloomberg, burning through cash on blocky virtual environments, glitchy avatars, expensive headsets, and a user base of approximately 38 people as of 2022. For many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; the metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their phone or laptop. Despite years of investment, VR remains burdened by serious structural limitations, and for most users there’s simply not enough compelling content beyond niche gaming. Zuckerberg is now preparing to slash Reality Labs’ budget by as much as 30%, Bloomberg said. The cuts—which could translate to $4 billion to $6 billion in reduced spend—would hit everything from the Horizon Worlds virtual platform to the Quest hardware unit. Layoffs could come as early as January, though final decisions haven’t been made, according to Bloomberg. The move follows a strategy meeting last month at Zuckerberg’s Hawaii compound, where he reviewed Meta’s 2026 budget and asked executives to find 10% cuts across the board, the report said. Reality Labs was told to go deeper. Competition in the broader VR market simply never took off the way Meta expected, one person said. The result: a division long viewed as a money sink is finally being reined in. Wall Street cheered. Meta’s stock jumped more than 4% Thursday on the news, adding roughly $69 billion in market value. “Smart move, just late,” Craig Huber of Huber Research told Reuters. Investors have been complaining for years that the metaverse effort was an expensive distraction, one that drained resources without producing meaningful revenue. Meta didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’srequest for comment, but it insists it isn’t killing the metaverse outright. A spokesperson told the South China Morning Post that the company is “shifting some investment from metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables,” point­ing to momentum behind its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which Zuckerberg says have tripled in sales over the past year. But there’s no avoiding the reality: AI is the new obsession, and the new money pit. Meta expects to spend around $72 billion on AI this year, nearly matching everything it has lost on the metaverse since 2021. That includes massive outlays for data centers, model development, and new hardware. Investors are much more excited about AI burn than metaverse burn, but even they want clarity on how much Meta will ultimately be spending—and for how long. Across tech, companies are evaluating anything that isn’t directly tied to AI. Apple is revamping its leadership structure, partially around AI concerns. Microsoft is rethinking the “economics of AI.” Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are pouring billions into cloud infrastructure to keep up with demand. Signs point to money-losing initiatives without a clear AI angle being on the chopping block, with Meta as a dramatic example. On the company’s most recent earnings call, executives didn’t use the word “metaverse” once.

Title: Stocks Have Rebounded Ahead of the Fed Meeting—But the Market's Leaders Are Changing

The stock market may not be roaring into the most wonderful time of the year, but it is chugging along. Its next big test, however, is right around the corner. Investors' attention has for days largely been fixed on Wednesday's rate decision from the Federal Reserve. Rising optimism that the Fed will cut at its last meeting of 2025—based on futures market data, it's viewed as a near-certainty—has helped the major indexes recover most of the ground they lost during the volatile first three weeks of November; the major U.S. indexes are within a few percentage points of fresh records as this week draws to a close. A lot changed below the surface last month. The Magnificent Seven group of tech heavyweights— Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—nearly entered a technical correction as investors debated whether big tech was spending too much on artificial intelligence. On Nov. 20, a blowout earnings report from Nvidia failed to put AI bubble fears to rest, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) closed the day 9% below its record high. It's not that long ago that there was serious doubt among investors about whether the Fed would cut rates at its December meeting, the last of the year. Now it's seen as a virtual certainty. That might increase investor appetite for risk assets, but in the runup to the meeting a broader slice of stocks has been climbing. This year’s least-loved sectors, meanwhile, including healthcare and energy, became leaders. More than 60% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index last month, compared with just 33% since the start of the year, suggesting “a change of leadership heading into 2026,” according to Bank of America analysts. Eight of the S&P 500's 11 sectors outperformed the broader index, they wrote, while tech lagged. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, an index that tracks the stocks of companies that move goods and people around the country, rose for a tenth consecutive day on Friday. According to Dow Theory, that's a bullish sign for stocks if observed alongside a rising Dow Jones Industrial Average. (The Dow Industrials rose on Friday, and is up nearly 5% over the past two weeks.) Fed officials are divided on how to proceed. Some policymakers fear that cutting rates too aggressively will stoke inflation, which has run above the Fed’s 2% target for more than four years and reaccelerated in recent months. Others fear that leaving rates unchanged will harm the weakening job market, potentially tipping the U.S. economy into recession. The government shutdown delayed the release of several vital economic reports, leaving officials no choice but to fly partially blind next week. The most recent official labor market data that policymakers have sent mixed signals, but data from private sources suggest the job market has continued to soften. The private sector shed 32,000 jobs in November, according to payroll provider ADP. Employers announced more than 150,000 layoffs in October, the highest number for that month since 2003. Wall Street generally expects the Fed will prioritize employment over inflation next week, moving to bring rates lower. Investors see an 87% chance the Fed cuts interest rates, according to federal funds futures trading data. Just two weeks ago, that figure was 30%. Update—December 5, 2025: This article has been updated to reflect the end of trading on Friday.

Title: Polymarket plans to use in-house market maker to trade against users: Report

The company has approached traders, including sports bettors, about joining the effort as it expands in the US and rival Kalshi faces scrutiny over similar practices. Polymarket is recruiting staff for an internal market-making team that may trade against users on its platform. The company has recently approached traders — including sports bettors — about joining the group, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the discussions. The initiative comes as Polymarket expands its US presence after resolving regulatory issues stemming from a 2022 case, when it paid a $1.4 million penalty to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Kalshi, a Polymarket competitor, already operates an internal unit known as Kalshi Trading, which places bids on its exchange to help support liquidity. The arrangement has drawn criticism from some users, and a proposed class-action lawsuit filed last month alleged that the desk sets betting lines that disadvantage customers. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have also sought external participants to supply liquidity on their platforms. On Kalshi, companies such as Susquehanna International Group have taken on market-making roles. Cointelegraph reached out to Polymarket for comment but had not received a response at time of publication. Related: Polymarket is opening US app to waitlisted users after CFTC green light Prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi have experienced significant growth in recent years, with both companies securing new partnerships and reaching high private-market valuations as the sector expands. The platforms enable users to bet on a wide range of events, from sports to predicting the next day’s weather in New York City. During The New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Thursday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argued that prediction markets’ trading desks could strengthen such markets’ accuracy. “If your goal is for the 99% of the people trying to get a signal about what’s going to happen in the world […] you actually want insider trading,” he said, adding that traders would benefit from “really good information” and “get a higher quality signal out of them.” He added: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who was also part of the discussion, was not so enthusiastic about prediction markets. “We try to help people navigate a 30-year outcome,” Fink said. “I don’t really care about what happens in the next moment. I’m aware in the betting market, in football, you can bet every play, but to me, this is not how I’m going to live my life.” In the third quarter of 2024, prediction markets saw a combined volume on the three largest platforms increase by 565% to $3.1 billion, up from $463.3 million in the prior quarter.

Title: Meta Confirms "Shifting Some" Funding "From Metaverse Toward AI Glasses"
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-confirms-shifting-some-funding-from-metaverse-toward-ai-glasses/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T17:24:23Z
Full Content:
Meta has officially confirmed "shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables", following reports of an up to 30% budget cut for parts of Reality Labs. Reality Labs, if you're unaware, is the division of Meta behind its Quest headsets, Horizon software, smart glasses, and sEMG wristband, as well as researching future technologies such as Codec Avatars and true AR glasses. Yesterday, Bloomberg first reported that the division is facing up to 30% budget cuts that would primarily target VR and Horizon Worlds. Following Bloomberg's report, other mainstream news outlets including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Insider have published their own reports corroborating the general claim, with slightly differing details, and the NYT and BI even received an official prepared statement from Meta, which the company confirmed to UploadVR. "Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables given the momentum there," the statement reads. "We aren't planning any broader changes than that." Business Insider's report suggests that the cuts will primarily hit Horizon Worlds, and that employees are facing "uncertainty" about whether this will involve layoffs. One likely cut BI's report mentions is the funding for third-party studios to build Horizon Worlds content. The New York Times report, on the other hand, seems more definitive in stating that these cuts will come via layoffs. Meta's funding shift from Horizon Worlds and VR to smart glasses comes just over a year after a leaked memo from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staff that 2025 will determine whether their projects are "the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure". In the memo, Bosworth described 2025 as "the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs", and told staff they "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR". Note that at the time, Meta was using MR to refer to VR too, a nomenclature that it ended earlier this year. "And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance", Bosworth followed that sentence with. Since then, Reality Labs saw its highest-ever quarterly revenue in Q4 2024 with the launch of Quest 3S, which was the top-selling console on Amazon US for Christmas. But this momentum did not carry through into 2025 at all. The first two quarters of 2025 saw Quest sales decline year-over-year, revealing that while Quest 3S was a popular stocking stuffer, it simply is not a successful year-round product. While Q3 saw a rebound, Meta explained that this was due to retailers stocking up on Quest 3S for this year's holiday season. Next year, our sources suggest that Meta has prioritized shipping an ultralight Horizon OS headset with a tethered compute puck instead of a traditional form factor Quest 4, and the company will be closely tracking how it performs in comparison to Quest 3 and Quest 3S through 2027. Meanwhile, Meta has continued to push its Horizon Worlds "metaverse" platform with multi-million-dollar creator competitions, especially focused on smartphone-only worlds, as the company hopes to scale the platform from a social VR space to a cross-platform Roblox and Fortnite competitor. But this doesn't seem to have gained much traction. Meta is set to roll out its Horizon Studio world creation toolset, powered by the Horizon Engine it built to replace Unity in Horizon Worlds, and the company will be closely tracking whether this meaningfully improves engagement. This relative stagnation in its Quest and Horizon Worlds efforts comes as the company is seeing skyrocketing sales and significant public and investor interest in its smart glasses. Back in February, in its Q4 2024 earnings call, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica said that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses had sold 2 million units, and in its Q2 2025 call in July said that sales had more than tripled since last year, performing "exceptionally well". In its Q2 2025 call in July, the company said that the glasses were performing "exceptionally well" in the market, with sales having more than tripled compared to 2024. During the February call, the company also announced that its annual production capacity for smart glasses would be increased to 10 million by the end of 2026. And in its Q3 2025 sales call in October, it said that it was accelerating this target to reach the 10 million annual production rate sooner, as smart glasses drove more than a third of its quarterly growth. This combination of significant success in the smart glasses space and relative failure in growing its VR headset and metaverse platform business is likely the driver of the company's decision to shift some funding to the former, hoping to further establish itself as the leader in the space before rival products from Apple and Google arrive.

Title: Meta's metaverse reversal nods to tech's new mantra: AI or the highway

Like a helicopter too heavy for lift off, tech companies are ditching anything they don't view as essential to get their AI plans off the ground. Meta is planning to cut its metaverse division's budget by as much as 30% and considering job cuts as part of the move, writes BI's Jyoti Mann and Pranav Dixit. The decision comes as tech companies look to pare back anything not directly focused on giving them an edge in the AI wars. Investors loved the move, with the stock finishing the day up almost 3.5%. For Meta, ditching the metaverse has been a long time coming. (We actually declared it dead back in checks notes May 2023.) During Meta's most recent earnings call, the word "metaverse" wasn't even used once. It's quite the reversal from when the metaverse was the literal inspiration for the entire company's rebrand from Facebook. But it's tough to keep making the case for funding something that burns billions of dollars and doesn't directly generate a ton of revenue. Especially when you need to make room for AI plans that are burning billions of dollars and have yet to directly generate a ton of revenue. Meta is unlikely to be the last company to cut non-AI-related fat. AI projects are really expensive. From hardware to talent to power, there doesn't appear to be a "cheap" way to do it. The space is also incredibly competitive, and even the first movers are feeling the heat. That's forcing companies to rethink their allocation of resources, particularly when it comes to projects that don't get them to their AI goals. Even those focused solely on AI are recalibrating their approach. OpenAI is sidelining ancillary projects to solely focus on beefing up ChatGPT. Tech companies with business lines already benefiting from the AI boom hold an advantage. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft's cloud businesses are experiencing an uptick from AI investments. Those players aren't standing still, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tapped a new advisor to "rethink the new economics of AI." Next month could be a good indication of how much tech companies are willing to throw overboard to keep their AI dreams afloat. Several companies conducted layoffs at the start of the year as part of their annual culling. Where companies draw the line will be interesting to watch. Money-losing endeavors not tied to AI will be obvious targets, but what about the stuff that is bringing in money but doesn't fit a company's future AI vision? How much will companies cut from what already is to support what could be? Jump to

Title: CoinEx Research November 2025 Report: Painvember's Brutal Reality Check
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/05/3200809/0/en/CoinEx-Research-November-2025-Report-Painvember-s-Brutal-Reality-Check.html
Time Published: 2025-12-05T15:01:00Z
Full Content:
December 05, 2025 10:01 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research’s November 2025 Report: Painvember is a brutal reality check after Uptober’s euphoric highs. Profit-taking by long-term holders, sustained ETF outflows, and cascading liquidations drove the downturn, all against a risk-off macro backdrop. While the Fed’s late-month dovish pivot and progress on the Ukraine–Russia peace framework briefly improved liquidity expectations, sentiment deteriorated again due to China reaffirming its crypto ban, S&P Global downgrading USDT, and rising Japanese yields threatening a yen carry-trade unwind. Beyond Bitcoin, AI and prediction-market sectors saw heightened volatility but also meaningful innovation and on-chain activity, while stablecoin flows printed their weakest reading in nearly a year, a key inflection point that may determine whether crypto enters a short-term correction or a new multi-month bear cycle. From Euphoria to Exhaustion: The Toughest Month of 2025 Following a fresh new high in early October, where Bitcoin peaked around $126,000, the momentum of "Uptober" dissipated rapidly, giving way to intense selling pressure throughout November. The asset plunged to a low of $80,500 before closing the month at $90,300, marking a 28% drawdown from its all-time high. This correction was fueled by profit-taking from OG whales, significant outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, and a wave of cascading liquidations, all amplified by a broader risk-off sentiment in the macroeconomic environment. On the macro side, the Federal Reserve shifted toward a more dovish stance late in the month, with market-implied odds of a 25-basis-point rate cut on December 10 climbing to 85%. This development, alongside progress in Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations, offered a glimmer of optimism for improved liquidity conditions in crypto markets. However, sentiment soured toward month-end amid several headwinds: China reaffirmed its stringent crypto ban, S&P Global downgraded Tether's USDT to its lowest "Weak" stability rating, rekindling concerns over stablecoin vulnerabilities, and rising Japanese government bond yields signaled a potential acceleration in the yen carry-trade unwind, pulling liquidity out of risk assets like Bitcoin. In our view, as crypto becomes increasingly institutionalized, macroeconomic factors will play an outsized role in dictating price action. For Bitcoin to avert a deeper bear phase, it must defend the critical $80,000–$82,000 support zone amid ongoing volatility. Key Charts to Watch BTC has remained weak this month, dipping to around $80k before rebounding. However, the overall rebound lacks strength and is highly likely to retest the $80k zone. A break below could lead to a decline toward the next key support at $73k. $ZEC failed to sustain its prior strength and retraced into a demand zone. As a move driven by fundamentals & spot demand, $ZEC’s current cycle may not yet be over—closely monitor price action at the support level. The AI Infrastructure Throne is Shaking In November, the AI sector presented a complex landscape of strong fundamentals yet escalating competition. The chip behemoth NVIDIA delivered better-than-expected earnings, but its stock price experienced significant volatility due to news that Meta plans to shift towards Google TPU chips. This sparked market concern that the monopolistic structure of AI infrastructure might be loosening. On the model front, Google formally released its flagship model, Gemini 3 Pro, boasting a 1M token context window and powerful multimodal capabilities, solidifying its position in the model arms race. Notably, China's Moonshot AI Lab also launched its kimi-k2-thinking model this month. This model, which utilizes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, achieves high-performance inference at extremely low training costs. This marks an intensification of the global open-source AI model competition, providing the decentralized AI community with a new low-cost, high-efficiency model option. AI Bubble FUD Spills Over The volatility in the stock prices and valuations of AI giants directly impacted the cryptocurrency market through the risk sentiment transmission chain. As high-beta core assets of the US tech sector, the short-term correction in AI concept stocks triggered a broader sell-off in "Risk-On Assets." This stock-crypto market linkage was prominent in November: the decline of market leaders like NVIDIA heightened fears of an AI bubble, subsequently leading to selling pressure on the crypto market near critical price points. Crypto AI Projects also Cooking The cryptocurrency AI track remained highly active and innovative in November. Infrastructure leader Bittensor (TAO) continued to expand its subnet ecosystem and attracted institutional capital through an ETP listing in the European market, with market focus shifting to its first halving mechanism in December. In terms of compute power, Render (RNDR) officially launched its Compute Subnet, transitioning into a pure AI inference computing network. The application and agent layers saw real-world stress testing: nof1.ai's Alpha Arena Season 1.5 commenced, deploying $320,000 in real capital, pitting multiple AI models, including Gemini 3 Pro and kimi-k2-thinking, against each other in real-time cryptocurrency and US stock token trading on the Hyperliquid DEX, directly placing the AI models' investment judgment capabilities in a competitive arena. Prediction Markets Enter Normalized High-Liquidity Era The prediction market’s weekly volume exceeded $3.6 billion in November, significantly surpassing the 2024 election peak. In our view, the market has successfully transitioned from an "event-driven" model to a phase of "normalized high liquidity." Polymarket maintains its stable retail user base, while Kalshi, leveraging compliance and institutional capital, has caught up to and, in periods, overtaken Polymarket in transaction volume. The Monad-based Opinion protocol surged in Q4, rapidly capturing a significant market share and challenging the established duopoly. Polymarket Builders Ecosystem: High Concentration & Strategic Value Extreme Volume Concentration: The Builders program has created a highly concentrated structure, with Betmoar dominating the ecosystem by capturing an astonishing 68.49% of all third-party front-end transaction volume. This highlights an "extreme head effect" driven by superior UX or specific incentives. Tier 2 Differentiation: The second tier, led by Standtrade (9.8%) and Polytraderpro (7.77%), proves that specialized interfaces (e.g., Pro tools for traders) still hold significant volume and room for differentiated competition. Strategic Long Tail: The remaining volume (~14%) is held by long-tail projects (like Polycule and Matchr.xyz). Though small, these independent front-ends are critical to Polymarket's overall censorship resistance and global market penetration. Stablecoin Flows Just Printed the Most Bearish Bar in a Year Stablecoin inflows have slowed significantly, with the next period's data being extremely critical. This month, stablecoins continued to see inflows, but the volume has slowed markedly, reaching the lowest level ($1.9B) in nearly a year. The next period's data is highly critical and could lead to two possible scenarios: Economic Data & Events to Watch in December 2025 About CoinEx Established in 2017, CoinEx is an award-winning cryptocurrency exchange designed with users in mind.

Title: AI Update, December 5, 2025: AI News and Views From the Past Two Weeks
URL: https://www.marketingprofs.com/opinions/2025/54083/ai-update-december-5-2025-ai-news-and-views-from-the-past-two-weeks
Time Published: 2025-12-05T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past two weeks or so: OpenAI declares 'code red' as rivals close in on ChatGPT. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly declared a "code red," telling staff to urgently improve ChatGPT as competitors like Google and Anthropic catch up. The company is pausing new initiatives such as ads, shopping and health agents, and the Pulse personal assistant to focus on speed, reliability, personalization, and broader question coverage. Daily coordination calls and temporary team transfers will support the push. The move underscores intensifying competition and the challenge of funding massive AI investments while still figuring out profitability. Importance for marketers: ChatGPT's road map is shifting toward core quality rather than new surfaces. Expect rapid, sometimes disruptive, UX changes that affect integrations, content workflows, and any planning based on future ad or commerce features. Google tests merging AI Overviews with AI Mode in Search. Google is testing a unified experience that connects AI Overviews with conversational AI Mode directly from the main search results page on mobile. Users who see an AI Overview at the top of results will be able to tap through and continue asking follow-up questions in an integrated chat with Gemini. Previously, people had to decide whether to start in classic search or switch into AI Mode. The experiment rolls out globally on mobile and aligns with Google's vision of frictionless, conversational information seeking. Importance for marketers: This further blurs the line between search and chat. Winning visibility means optimizing content so AI Overviews and conversational follow-ups surface your brand, not just ranking in traditional blue links. ChatGPT adds shopping research to power product discovery. OpenAI launched a shopping research feature in ChatGPT that turns product discovery into a multistep conversation. Users describe what they need, answer follow-up questions about preferences and budget, and receive a customized buyer's guide. The system pulls price, availability, specs, reviews, and images from across the web, and users can refine results by marking items as "Not interested" or "More like this." The feature, powered by a shopping-specialized GPT-5 mini variant, currently performs best in consumer categories such as electronics, beauty, home, and sports. Importance for marketers: Early-stage product comparison can now happen entirely inside ChatGPT. Retailers and brands must ensure their product data, structured content, and site visibility align with how OpenAI's shopping system discovers, evaluates, and ranks items. Retailers race to be seen by AI as holiday shopping goes agentic. Big US retailers are adapting to an AI-shaped shopping landscape, where tools like ChatGPT and Gemini recommend products alongside traditional search and ads. With most of the projected $253 billion in online holiday sales still coming through classic web journeys, AI referrals are small but growing and show higher purchase intent. Brands are experimenting with AI-only websites hidden from human shoppers, ramping up blog and Reddit content, and seeking coverage in editorial "best of" lists that scrapers ingest. Early data shows AI-driven traffic rising sharply year over year. Importance for marketers: Generative engine optimization is becoming operational reality. Teams need content, technical SEO, and reputation tactics designed explicitly to feed AI scrapers and agentic recommendation systems, not just human readers. Ads appear headed to ChatGPT's free app experience. Code discovered in a beta version of the ChatGPT Android app suggests OpenAI is preparing an ads feature, with references to "bazaar content," "search ad," and a "search ads carousel." That implies the free ChatGPT app may soon include advertising alongside or within responses. OpenAI has so far relied on subscriptions and API usage for revenue, but IT remains unprofitable and reportedly faces large funding needs to sustain its growth. CEO Sam Altman has previously said he is not opposed to ads if they are implemented carefully. Importance for marketers: If search-style ads arrive in ChatGPT, it effectively becomes a new paid media channel. Marketers should expect auction dynamics, creative formats, and measurement questions similar to search—only now embedded inside conversational experiences. DeepSeek releases open-source models that challenge GPT-5. Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled two large models, DeepSeek-V3.2 and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, claiming performance on par with or better than GPT-5 and Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro on elite math, coding, and reasoning benchmarks. A sparse attention architecture dramatically cuts inference costs and supports long context windows, enabling cheaper processing of large documents. Both models, with hundreds of billions of parameters, are released under an MIT open-source license, including full weights and tooling. Regulators in Europe and the US are already scrutinizing DeepSeek over data and national security concerns. Importance for marketers: Frontier-level capabilities are moving into free, open models. This could reduce dependence on a few US providers, but also raises questions about data governance, compliance, and where sensitive customer or campaign data is processed. AI helps drive record $11.8 billion in Black Friday online sales. US Black Friday online spending hit a record $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from 2024, according to Adobe Analytics. AI-powered shopping tools played a major role, helping consumers navigate inflation worries, tariffs, and flat discount levels. AI-driven traffic to retail sites rose more than 800% compared with last year, aided by tools such as Walmart's Sparky and Amazon's Rufus. Globally, Salesforce estimates AI and agents influenced $14.2 billion in Black Friday online sales. Higher prices and stronger luxury demand offset fewer units per order. Importance for marketers: AI assistants now materially shape holiday commerce, from price discovery to basket composition. Brands should instrument journeys to understand AI-assisted paths to purchase and adjust promotion tactics, messaging, and merchandising accordingly. EU plans to delay high-risk AI rules until 2027 after industry pushback. The European Commission proposed delaying enforcement of stricter AI Act rules on high-risk use cases from August 2026 to December 2027. The changes, part of a broader "Digital Omnibus," aim to streamline digital regulations, cut administrative burdens, and respond to criticism from Big Tech and other businesses. Affected areas include biometric identification, hiring and exams, utilities, road traffic, health services, creditworthiness, and law enforcement. Proposed GDPR tweaks would also allow large tech firms to use Europeans' personal data to train AI models under certain conditions. Importance for marketers: The delay gives organizations extra time to align their AI-driven hiring, customer scoring, and service workflows with EU rules. However, eventual compliance is inevitable, especially for profiling, risk scoring, and use of personal data for model training. Study finds AI companies' safety practices lag global standards. A new edition of the Future of Life Institute's AI safety index concludes that major AI firms, including Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, and Meta, fall far short of emerging global safety standards. An expert panel found none had robust plans to control advanced, potentially superintelligent systems, despite rising public concern about harms such as self-harm, psychosis, and AI-enabled hacking. The report criticizes both limited regulation and aggressive lobbying against binding rules, even as companies invest hundreds of billions in new AI infrastructure. Importance for marketers: As safety narratives intensify, brands deploying AI for customer engagement, personalization, or support must show credible guardrails. Clear policies, human escalation paths, and transparent messaging about AI limitations will increasingly factor into brand trust and corporate reputation. White House pauses order that would preempt state AI laws. The Trump administration has paused a draft executive order that would have empowered the Justice Department to challenge state AI laws and threaten broadband funding to states that impose their own AI regulations. The draft envisioned an "AI Litigation Task Force" to argue that such state rules unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce. Lawmakers from both parties opposed the plan, calling it an attack on state efforts to address fraud, deepfakes, and child abuse imagery. Critics said it would prioritize AI industry concerns over consumer protections. Importance for marketers: The pause preserves a patchwork of state-level AI rules for now. Brands using AI in advertising, personalization, and content generation still need to track state regulations and avoid assuming a single federal standard will override local restrictions. EU edges toward banning social media and AI chatbots for those under 16 who don't have consent. The European Parliament adopted a nonbinding resolution calling for a ban on social media for teens under 16 without parental consent, extending to AI chatbots due to mental health concerns. The move aligns Europe with Australia's stricter youth protections and follows French President Emmanuel Macron's criticism of addictive algorithms and "Wild West" platforms. Implementation details remain unclear, but the plan may rely on a digital identity wallet for age verification, requiring teens to re-verify regularly. Critics warn of a pervasive "digital checkpoint" infrastructure. Importance for marketers: Youth-focused campaigns in Europe could face dramatic access and targeting changes. Age-gating, consent workflows, and channel strategies for teen audiences will need to adapt to stricter verification regimes and possibly reduced reach. EU opens antitrust probe into Meta's AI plans for WhatsApp. The European Commission has launched an antitrust investigation into Meta over policies that may restrict rival AI assistants on WhatsApp, giving an advantage to Meta's own Meta AI. Complaints from smaller companies alleged that changes to access rules could block competing chatbots from reaching users on the platform. EU officials are considering interim measures and note that the case is separate from, but complementary to, digital gatekeeper rules under the Digital Markets Act. Italy's antitrust authority is running a parallel investigation. Importance for marketers: If WhatsApp becomes more locked down around Meta's AI, access to users through third-party assistants could narrow. Brands betting on independent AI agents for messaging campaigns and customer service must track how platform owners control AI distribution and integrations. Anthropic launches Claude Opus 4.5 for enterprise-grade coding and analysis. Anthropic announced Claude Opus 4.5, its newest flagship model, tailored for professional developers and knowledge workers such as analysts and consultants. Opus 4.5 follows recent releases of Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 and is positioned as state-of-the-art for agentic coding tasks, outperforming rivals like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5.1 on SWE-bench Verified. Anthropic says the model excels at working with spreadsheets, slide decks, and deep research, and will serve as the default for its Pro, Max, and Enterprise offerings. Importance for marketers: Stronger coding and analysis capabilities make it easier to automate campaign reporting, dashboard building, and data exploration. Enterprise teams can offload more operational work to AI and redirect human effort toward brand, creative, and strategy. Anthropic introduces Claude for Nonprofits with steep discounts and connectors. Anthropic, in partnership with GivingTuesday, launched Claude for Nonprofits to help resource-constrained organizations adopt AI. Eligible nonprofits can receive up to 75% off Team and Enterprise plans, with access to Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and Opus 4.5 on request. The program includes open-source connectors to Benevity, Blackbaud, and Candid, plus a free AI Fluency for Nonprofits course via Anthropic Academy. Partners such as Bridgespan and Vera Solutions will support strategy and implementation. Importance for marketers: Nonprofit marketing and development teams gain access to enterprise-grade AI at lower cost. That can raise expectations for content quality, grant output, donor personalization, and reporting even in smaller organizations, reshaping benchmarks for nonprofit communications and fundraising. Mistral debuts new large and small models to stay in the AI race. French AI startup Mistral released a new suite of models, including Mistral 3, which it calls the world's best open-weight multimodal, multilingual large model, and a compact Ministral 3 model for devices, robots, and drones. The company, recently valued at 11.7 billion euros after a funding round led by ASML and Nvidia, positions the models for agents, retrieval-augmented systems, and complex enterprise workflows. Ministral 3 can run on a single GPU, lowering costs and supporting on-device use without network access. Importance for marketers: Mistral's open-weight models expand options beyond US giants, especially in Europe. Flexible deployment on devices and lower-cost infrastructure could enable more localized, privacy-conscious AI experiences in campaigns and customer touchpoints. Nvidia takes $2 billion stake in Synopsys to deepen AI design tools. Nvidia has invested $2 billion in chip design software maker Synopsys, acquiring about 4.8 million shares in a private placement and becoming one of its largest shareholders. The expanded tie-up will see Synopsys use Nvidia's developer tools and libraries to build AI-powered applications for chip design, verification, and other electronic design automation tasks. The deal follows a string of major AI investments by Nvidia, including stakes in OpenAI and Intel. Synopsys shares rose on the news while Nvidia's dipped slightly. Importance for marketers: Nvidia's growing influence across the AI hardware and software stack could reinforce its position as the default infrastructure layer. Over time, this may affect model availability, pricing, and performance for SaaS tools and marketing platforms your teams depend on. ByteDance launches Doubao-powered AI voice assistant on ZTE phones. ByteDance is introducing an AI voice control tool, powered by its Doubao large language model, that will debut on ZTE's Nubia M153 smartphone before rolling out to other manufacturers. Users will be able to find content and book tickets via voice, competing with AI features from Huawei and Xiaomi. Apple's Apple Intelligence is not yet available in China, though Alibaba has announced collaboration plans. ByteDance stresses it will not build its own phones and is partnering across the ecosystem. Importance for marketers: In China, voice AI entry points are diversifying beyond a single platform. For brands targeting Chinese consumers, discoverability strategies must consider device-level assistants and super-app ecosystems, not just search or social. Wikipedia seeks more AI licensing deals to cover scraping costs. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales says the nonprofit is negotiating additional licensing agreements with AI companies, similar to its existing deal with Google, to offset infrastructure costs from heavy AI crawling. High-volume automated access forces Wikipedia to pay for more servers and memory, even though its content remains free to individuals. Wales argues donors did not intend to subsidize multibillion-dollar AI products, and suggests technical tools like Cloudflare's AI Crawl Control may limit bots if companies do not pay. Importance for marketers: As key knowledge sources demand compensation or restrict access, training data and content availability may shift. Brands that rely on reference-style content, UGC, or wikis should anticipate changing terms for how AI systems can use and quote that material. Amazon workers warn about an all-costs-justified AI strategy. More than 1,000 Amazon employees have anonymously signed an open letter criticizing the company's "all-costs-justified" AI push. Organized by Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, the petition warns that AI investments risk fueling layoffs, environmental damage from energy-hungry data centers, and abuse in surveillance and deportation contexts. Workers say executives overstate AI benefits while downplaying internal dissatisfaction and climate impact. Signers include senior engineers, product leaders, marketers, and warehouse staff, many of whom fear retaliation in a more restrictive internal climate. Importance for marketers: Internal resistance to AI rollouts can affect brand reputation, recruiting, and customer trust. Marketers must factor employee sentiment and social responsibility into how they communicate AI initiatives, both externally and in employer branding. Amazon pulls AI anime dubs after fan and creator backlash. Amazon's Prime Video quietly rolled back a beta program that used AI to generate English and Spanish dubs for several anime titles; the move came after fierce criticism from fans and voice actors. The AI dubs, seen as undermining human performers and delivering poor quality, triggered online outrage, including high-profile critiques from well-known dub actors. Some English AI dubs have been removed, though certain Spanish versions remain. The episode follows broader industry hesitation around visible generative AI use in films and television. Importance for marketers: Audiences can strongly reject AI-generated creative work if it feels like cost-cutting at the expense of quality or livelihoods. For brand content, transparency, creative standards, and collaboration with human talent are essential to avoid reputational blowback. OpenAI to acquire Neptune for deeper training analytics. OpenAI has agreed to acquire Neptune, a startup that builds monitoring and debugging tools for AI model training workflows. The two companies already collaborated on a metrics dashboard for foundation-model teams. Neptune will wind down its external services, and terms of the deal were not disclosed. OpenAI plans to integrate Neptune's fast, precise analysis system into its training stack to expand visibility into how models learn. The acquisition joins a string of OpenAI deals aimed at strengthening internal tooling and capabilities. Importance for marketers: Better training analytics can translate into more reliable, capable models powering the tools marketers use daily. Over time, that may mean fewer unexplained failures, more consistent output quality, and faster iteration on new features in marketing and creative platforms. Russian tech leader compares AI power to a new nuclear club. Alexander Vedyakhin, first deputy CEO of Russia's Sberbank, argues that AI will create a "nuclear club" of nations with their own large language models, conferring influence comparable to nuclear technology. He says Russia must maintain at least two or three homegrown models for sensitive domains and cannot rely on foreign systems. Vedyakhin claims Sberbank's GigaChat models rival top Western systems but warns that energy and infrastructure demands make AI investment risky and potentially unprofitable, especially amid sanctions and limited hardware access. Importance for marketers: Geopolitical competition around AI may drive national preferences and restrictions on which models can be used in certain markets. Global brands should anticipate localization requirements, data residency rules, and political sensitivities around AI vendor choice. Trump's Genesis Mission aims to use AI for scientific and energy breakthroughs. President Trump signed an executive order launching the "Genesis Mission," billed as the largest mobilization of US scientific resources since Apollo. The Department of Energy will build an AI-enabled platform to support research in areas such as energy, national security, and drug discovery. Officials say AI will automate experiments, speed simulations, and generate predictive models to cut energy costs and accelerate breakthroughs. The initiative has no public cost estimate but promises new partnerships with companies, including Nvidia and Dell. Importance for marketers: Large government-backed AI programs can accelerate innovation in energy, healthcare, and infrastructure, indirectly creating new markets and narratives. Marketers in B2B and public sector contexts should watch where funding flows, as it will shape future demand, partnership opportunities, and policy direction.

Title: State Street still using DEI to curry favor with leftist state officials — despite Wall Street clampdown
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/business/state-street-still-using-dei-to-curry-favor-with-leftist-state-officials/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T14:50:28Z
Full Content:
Woke investing has faced a clampdown on Wall Street, but if its critics are to be believed State Street – one of the biggest asset managers in the US – is still using it to curry favor with leftist state and local officials who control hundreds of billions of dollars in pension money, The Post has learned. State Street’s work involving controversial Diversity Equity and Inclusion and green energy policies — where it facilitates woke shareholder votes on behalf of some of its big, public pension clients — has sparked chatter on Wall Street and Washington following New York City Comptroller Brad Lander’s move last month to block rival BlackRock as a manager of the city’s pension fund. In a recent posting on X, Alabama GOP senator Tommy Tuberville said State Street, which manages $8 billion in city pension money overseen by Lander, is “already caving to the WOKE Mamdani climate agenda before he has even taken office.” Lander is a key supporter of the socialist New York City mayor elect Zohran Mandani, who himself supports policies such as DEI and green energy. For its part, State Street says it’s getting a bad rap — and it has some strong evidence suggesting as much. The bank offers nearly a dozen such proxy-voting frameworks for pension funds, including those that appeal to Red State public officials that steer clear of anything woke. It doesn’t engage directly with US companies to push stuff like Diversity Equity and Inclusion employment policies or green energy. Rather it facilitates shareholder votes on these measures for progressive pension-fund clients, people like Lander — the fiduciary of the city retirement funds — during what’s known as “proxy season,” when big investors get to vote on corporate governance proposals. Yet the controversy is real. Lander isn’t looking to ditch BlackRock – headed by investing prodigy Larry Fink – because it has done a bad job managing the retirement funds of the city’s firemen, teachers and police. Rather, Lander’s beef is that BlackRock has gone non-woke in recent years. After fully embracing corporate government policies like Environment Social Governance investing, the big asset manager no longer demands strict adherence to so-called carbon-neutral edicts, meaning it won’t force ExxonMobil to invest in windmills versus drilling. It also won’t demand strict gender and racial preferences in appointing board members. State Street, meanwhile, offers something known as the “Sustainability Stewardship Service Proxy Voting and Engagement Policy.” The policy, reviewed by The Post, dictates how the firm will push proxy or shareholder votes on shares it holds for its woke clients on a range of corporate governance edicts, including those, critics say, that are on dubious legal grounds. Those include “progress made against deforestation- and other land use-related targets and commitments” and whether portfolio companies “regularly identify whether there are risks related to human rights in their operations and value chain.” Most controversial, critics say, are the firm’s “Diversity” standards, which hold that “Effective board oversight of a company’s long-term business strategy necessitates gender diversity, and the level of such diversity depends on various factors including culture and progress made.” The standards also require board-level “racial/ethnic diversity in select markets.” State Street’s moves appear to run counter to the recent corporate shift away from DEI. Most large companies, even such diversity stalwarts as JPMorgan and BlackRock, have sought to roll back strict adherence to DEI in hiring and in business dealings – including asset management. Trump later doubled down on ending DEI, issuing an executive order that “directs all departments and agencies to take strong action to end private sector DEI discrimination, including civil compliance investigations.” Press officials from State Street say there is nothing improper about how it handles DEI and other progressive shareholder votes because it’s doing so at the behest of their clients, like Lander, when they demand it. It also facilitates votes for conservative public officials who run pension assets in Middle America and the south. “The sustainability policy that you’re referencing is a policy that our clients can choose or not choose … our voting and engagement policies and practices comply with US law,” wrote spokesman Mark LaVoie.

The funeral is taking place in St Patricks Cathedral, Dublin. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos Award-winning architect Hugh Wallace has been described as “honest, passionate and deeply human” during his funeral at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin. Mourners were told how the TV star, who died suddenly at home at the age of 68 last Sunday, and his husband, Martin Corbett, were planning to move to a new home this weekend. His funeral service took place this morning at a packed St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin, where he was baptised. Mourners included presenters Dermot Bannon and Brendan Courtney in attendance. Hugh Wallace's husband, Martin Corbett, and family leaving St Patrick's Cathedral after the funeral service in Dublin. Photo: Sam Boal/Collins Photos Today's News in 90 - Friday December 5 At the beginning of the service, one of Mr Wallace’s favourite songs, Judy Garland’s Somewhere Over the Rainbow, was played. The Dean of the cathedral, the Very Reverend William Morton, who led the service, described Mr Wallace as ”honest, direct, passionate, challenging and deeply human” and as a “man who quite literally shaped the spaces in which others live their lives”. “He lived fully. He lived deeply. He left his mark unmistakably,” he told the mourners. “For the last 10 years, since beginning with the series Home of the Year, television viewers were delighted to welcome Hugh into their living rooms. His endearing and gregarious nature, his good humour and optimism, and the fact that he was always so unassuming meant that we all thought he had been on our screens for far longer than he had,” he said. “He was, as we say, a natural with his characteristic voice, his large spectacles, colourful shirts and jumpers. “Hugh, of course, was known to many through his work on television, knowledgeable, forthright, unafraid to speak plainly and never short of conviction, he understood buildings, but more than that, he understood people.” Martin Corbett leaving after the funeral service of Hugh Wallace who passed away unexpectedly at home. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos “A home is where love abides, and everyone who knew Hugh knows that his true home was found in his life with Martin in shared work, shared laughter, shared dreams and shared courage. Their new home held so much in store for them, yet the love that filled those plans does not vanish with death,” Rev Morton added. The dean said he was “fascinated” to hear about the couple’s new house – located just next door to their current home. "Hugh had successfully sought planning permission to have a window put into his bedroom from which he could see the spire of St Patrick's [Cathedral]. "And now, as the spire he saw from his window still stands over the city, so too does the impact of his life stand as it always will in the hearts of those who knew him and who respected him.” During the funeral, friend and fellow architect John Waters paid a tribute to his late friend by making a speech as if Hugh Wallace himself was speaking to mourners. “I’m afraid I was taken by complete surprise on Sunday. I didn't think I'd get a sudden exit. I had assumed a more flamboyant exit in years to come, after much more TV success and perhaps a couple of Bafta Awards, because the rumours were there. “Things were going so well. Douglas Wallace Consultants were flying. My TV career was flying, and furniture was coming for the house that Martin and I had been working on for three years. “With everything that was going on, I'm afraid the universe took its own decision on Sunday night, and here we all are.” Mr Wallace, who was a judge on every RTÉ’s Home of the Year, was born in 1956 and the only child of Susan and Kenneth. TV personality Dermot Bannon leaving after the funeral of Hugh Wallace. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos He met his husband Martin on Valentine’s Day in 1988 at the George bar in Dublin. "Martin has often accused me of having only child syndrome, and I take that as meaning I'm a special person,” Mr Waters continued, speaking on behalf of Mr Wallace. “Some of you may remember the phrase in Dublin that love stories begin at [nightclub] Zhivago. A lot of fairy tales also began at the George pub in Dublin, and Martin and I were part of a fairytale. It was Valentine's night of 1988, and we lasted together for 37 years, which I'd take again if I could. “Martin never really bought into the celebrity stuff. Martin loved me for me; he became my civil partner in 2012, and he stuck with me to the end, right up until Sunday night. “We really did travel the world together and meet very interesting people, but behind the celebrity and the public persona, Martin and I were really two ordinary guys. We had the same hopes, fears, dreams and wants as everyone else. “I'm just going to ask you to remember I've had some of the best times of my life with most of you, or some of you. It's important that when you think of those, you smile, don't be sad. Give Martin a shoulder to lean on if he needs it, be kind to each other." He later quoted William Shakespeare, and said: “Let thee all remember that a pop of colour will brighten your day.” TV presenter Brendan Courtney arrives for the funeral of tv personality and architect Hugh Wallace who passed away unexpectedly at home on the 1st of Dec 2025. The funeral is taking place in St Patricks Cathedral, Dublin. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos Mr Wallace always knew he was going to have a career in architecture and design, he said. “I met a kindred spirit, Alan Douglas, and by the end of 1982, in the face of a biting recession, we set up Douglas Wallace architects from our rented flat in Blackrock. So things were starting to move, and we were starting to be known. It was a mad, busy time. There were ups, there were downs, there were tears, there was laughter, there was building of lifetime friendships. “Then came the 90s, and we got bigger contracts, shopping centres, bars, restaurants. We grew, projects got bigger. Our offices got bigger. We had offices in London, Belfast, Prague. We're doing hotels with designers and hotels with visionaries. “Then came 2008, and we all fell over the cliff. They say you can't keep good men down. And from the ashes of Douglas Wallace Mark One came Douglas Wallace Consultants, a new gang of tightly knit directors, of which I am pleased to say I was still part. ”Later on in my career, I got a real lucky break in relation to the TV programmes. It was such a shock to me that that came at that age, but I really embraced it. "As you all know, I loved it, and I'm chuffed to bits with the feedback that I got in terms of the knowledge that I was able to share. I was privileged to do that in the way I did.” The funeral cortege arrives at Dublin's St Patrick's Cathedral. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos

Title: Dragon Age Day Comes And Goes In Complete Silence Just One Year After Veilguard
URL: https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-day-bioware-layoffs-december-4-2000650888
Time Published: 2025-12-05T13:55:18Z
Full Content:
Dragon Age: The Veilguard December 4th is Dragon Age Day, the unofficial day fans of BioWareâs fantasy RPG anthology celebrate the series. Last year, the studio earnestly participated. Dragon Age: The Veilguard was only about a month old at the time, so BioWare released the gameâs incredible character creator for free and broke down early player choices on social media. This year? There wasnât a peep from the studio on the matter. Not even a single mention of the franchise that once won âBest Gameâ at the Game Awards. If you look at BioWareâs Dragon Age social accounts, the last time the studio used the gameâs X account was to repost an ad for The Veilguard on the EA Play subscription service on August 28. The developerâs official blogâs last post was on November 7, celebrating Mass Effectâs equivalent âholiday,â N7 Day, which had a small update on the upcoming fifth game and the Amazon television series. Youâll find no such post about Dragon Age. BioWare has admitted itâs become a one-game studio after massive layoffs back in January, so there is no fifth Dragon Age game in the works, but the silence also casts a shadow on the RPG seriesâ past.Â If youâre only passively paying attention, it might make sense for the studio to not make a big deal about a series without a sequel itâs actively promoting. But for fans and the developers who spent decades working on Dragon Age, itâs another insult to beloved games that seemed to sometimes get the short end of the stick over their troubled development. In the months since BioWare was gutted of veteran talent and Dragon Age: The Veilguard was thrown under the bus by parent company Electronic Arts, developers have been candid about how the Dragon Age team felt like it wasnât treated fairly by the broader company. The Veilguardâs messy production saw the game rebooted from a live service no one wanted into a single-player RPG that, miraculously, came out feeling like the character-driven epics BioWare is associated with despite being a decade in the works.Â After the game didnât reach internal projections out of the gate, EA downsized BioWare and has focused the company exclusively on Mass Effect, and implied that The Veilguard may have reached a broader audience if it had stayed a live service game no one asked for. So perhaps itâs for the best that BioWare didnât acknowledge Dragon Age this year. If the company had even made a tweet or blog post expressing its love for the world of Thedas and pride in having brought it to life, the messaging would have come across as tone-deaf after the hell its team reportedly went through.Â At least this way, the fans and creatives who made these games get the day to themselves, without it being co-opted by a studio and publisher that treated them like second-class citizens.

Title: Report: Meta planning massive cuts to Reality Labs metaverse division

Time Published: 2025-12-05T13:01:58Z

Company expected to redirect investment to augmented reality glasses Tech giant Meta is reportedly looking to make cuts in its Reality Labs metaverse division, the home of the Quest VR headest and the Horizon Worlds platform. That's according to Bloomberg, which reports that execs at the company are eying up budget reductions of as much as 30% during 2026. Layoffs might be take place as early as January. The company is planning cuts across the board, but more extensively to the metaverse division because it has not seen significant competition in the space, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg. Investors and analysts have been demanding the company reduce its heavily lossmaking investments in the sector, which run at billions of dollars per quarter. The firm is reportedly not looking to abandon its metaverse plans, but is moving the money it is saving with these cuts into its augmented reality glasses, currently produced in partnership with Ray-Ban, according to additional reporting by the New York Times. “Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio, we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse towards AI glasses and wearables, given the momentum there. We aren’t planning any broader changes than that,” a Meta spokesperson told the FT. Following the Bloomberg report, the company's stock shot up 5.5% when the markets opened on Thursday morning, suggesting investor approval for the changes. Meta's share price ended the day 3.4% higher. In February 2025, Meta disclosed that despite its Meta Quest hardware yielding $1.08 billion in revenue, the Reality Labs division recorded a $4.97 billion loss. This part of the company has been in the red for much of its existence and lost over $70 billion since the company pivoted to focus on the metaverse. For the three months ending September 30, 2025, Meta reported a $4.4 billion operational loss – largely in line with the previous year's figures – while for the nine months ending September 30th, this loss comes to $13.2 billion, a 3% increase year-on-year. Meta CFO Susan Li told investors that the company expected lower Reality Labs revenue for its Q4, which ends on December 30, 2025. Facebook rebranded as Meta Platforms back in 2021, such was Zuckerburg and co.'s conviction that the metaverse was the future of digital communication. Despite Meta's more recent focus on AI, the company announced last month that it was cutting 600 jobs from its Superintelligence Labs division. The cuts would be the latest in a series of significant job losses at the company. In January of this year, Meta cut 5% of its workforce, estimated to be around 3,600 staff, while in 2023, it laid off 10,000 workers and retired 5,000 open roles.

Title: Are retail investors trying to tell us something about Apple?

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As an avid Apple Music user, I felt left out on Spotify Wrapped Day earlier this week. Most of my Spotify-using friends and coworkers gleefully swapped musical tastes all day long as I sat on the outside. "But Apple has an intuitive interface and superior audio quality," I mumbled into my coffee, to no one in particular. As it turns out, retail investors have been similarly treating Apple like an afterthought. During the shortened Thanksgiving week, they piled into every Magnificent 7 stock but Apple, pulling $96 million out, according to JPMorgan data. (For context, Nvidia led inflows with $650 million.) What's more, JPMorgan found that day traders have been consistent sellers of Apple throughout the year. This matches data from Schwab showing that its clients were net sellers of Apple during the third quarter. The reason is relatively straightforward to anyone who's followed the AI race this year: Apple is behind — or at least that's the perception investors have. While fellow contestants Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta loudly pile tens of billions of dollars into AI and ink huge deals with one another, Apple has been its typically quiet self. The secrecy and painstaking caution that helped the company create and mass-manufacture some of the world's most ubiquitous consumer products is now viewed as a drawback. Apple's competitors are growing more aggressive, and it's struggling to match that energy. Reflective of cooling retail interest is middling stock performance for Apple, especially by its high standards. It's up 12% year to date, trailing the S&P 500 by almost five percentage points. This is a company that's exceeded a 30% annual return in five of the last six years! And it's not just retail investors getting cold feet about Apple. Berkshire Hathaway has trimmed its holding in the company by two-thirds from its peak position (although the stock remains Berkshire's top holding by value). Viking Global went as far as to offload its entire stake in the fourth quarter of last year. As for how it's going at Apple right now, it's hard to ignore the exit of the company's AI chief. Sure, there's a talent war raging in the industry, but Apple has more cash on hand than most small nations. If it wanted to pay up to keep key people, it could. It also doesn't help that criticism is coming from high places. A co-creator of the tech behind Siri recently said it was a misstep to make the AI agent voice-only. Still, I'd stop short of breaking out the violins for Apple. It remains an undeniable juggernaut. But it does have newly resurgent Alphabet nipping at its heels, and Microsoft isn't far behind. It could soon lose its spot as the second-most-valuable company. Ultimately, there's a difference between being a mega-profitable behemoth and also having your stock price trounce peers and go straight up forever. Apple eventually might have to settle for the former. Jump to

Title: No, Progressives Don’t Want “Purity.” They Just Want Some Courage.

Time Published: 2025-12-05T11:00:00Z

Mainstream Democrats use dozens of old catchphrases that suggest they’re out of step. “When they go low, we go high,” for example, sounded fine when Michelle Obama first said it in 2016, but it passed its sell-by date almost the next day. For quite some time, the Democratic Party, which is still closely aligned with banks and billionaires, has needed to go anywhere but high. But it’s the meme of the “purity test” that should spike real worry that the Democratic Party is missing the moment right now. Party standard-bearers still use the phrase as a slur to trivialize legitimate questions from the left. It’s a petty and defensive move, and it comes across as a refusal to engage with the most obvious and urgent questions facing the party and the country. A recent case in point involved New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Booker is a tireless legislator who two weeks ago sponsored a promising bill to provide support for family caregivers, but he has sometimes been criticized for his coziness with Big Tech and Big Pharma. In October, the popular firebrand Jennifer Welch of the podcast I’ve Had It asked Booker why he and other Democrats had turned to “Neville Chamberlain–type appeasement” with President Trump. As just one example, Welch cited Booker’s confirmation of one of Trump’s shadiest ambassadors, Charlie Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s father-in-law; a felon and a billionaire real-estate developer from Booker’s home state of New Jersey. “What do you have to say about the capitulation that you participated in?” Booker smiled. He tried to seem unflappable. He then waved away Welch as “holding up a purity test.” “That’s such bullshit,” Welch shot back. “It’s not a purity test. It’s, Are we in this fight? Are we being beholden to corporations and corporate interests? Or, Are we really the party of the working class?” Welch was right. “Purity test” is bullshit, and it’s a deflection Democrats must stop using. Challenges to politicians on major issues, including foreign policy, acceptance of corporate money, and failure to keep ICE out of cities—these are not puritanical attacks on their lifestyles. They are credible allegations that the party must acknowledge and address: that Democrats are allies of Republican hawks like Liz Cheney, valets for private equity, and hopeless incrementalists on social justice. (“Never forget that slavery lasted over 200 years,” said the comedian Christina Brown, playing a generic Democrat, in an extremely popular video sketch. “Because progress takes time.” Another “Democrat” in the sketch, this one played by Prance, added, “We’re going to stand up for Black people. Blackrock. Blackwater mercenaries. Blackstone. Black sites. Black ops.”) To dismiss the concerns of progressives is to deepen the demoralization that many of them have felt since 2015, when, as they see it, Democrats put Trump in office by keeping Senator Bernie Sanders and his then-insurgent socialism off the ticket. Right or wrong, the Democrats’ failure to nominate Sanders in 2016 is the origin story of the modern left, and they’re sticking to it. That cursed election is not available for relitigation. So now it’s up to older Democrats, who came up believing that unfettered capitalism was the country’s one true path, to stop trying to censor this generation of liberals, and start learning from them. And if the Democratic leadership doesn’t want to watch satire on TikTok to understand their own party, they can at least look at the polls. According to Gallup in September, fully 66 percent of Democrats view socialism, by that name, favorably. Bullishness on socialism is up a whopping 16 points since 2010, Obama’s heyday. At the same time, per the Gallup poll, only 17 percent of Democrats view big business favorably, while—and this is especially surprising—a mere 36 percent of independents do. Anti-monopoly views are clearly no longer the province only of sullen Occupy alumni. Look at those numbers. The vast majority of the gettable electorate can now be spooked by even a hint that the Democratic Party is ignoring the people in favor of rich or ideological donors, corporate interests, Black Rock, Blackstone, and billionaire PACs. The purity-test dodge seems to have started during the presidential primary of 2019, when Barack Obama told a room of Bay Area donors that Democrats running for president should not be “woke” or engage in “cancel culture.” (Why did that daft formulation waylay so many minds, institutions, and opinion pages?) Nor, Obama said, should Democrats run on positions that could turn off the center and the center-right. What those positions were exactly he didn’t say, but good guesses include taxing the rich and downscaling the police. “I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections,” he told the Silicon Valley crowd. “Because, you know what, the country is complicated.” Complicated? Was that 2019-speak for something like “hopping with billionaires who must not be taxed”? If by “complicated” Obama had meant the country was increasingly socialist, he would have come closer to the mark. But in those days “complexity” was all about trying to seduce Republicans and the rich. A few months after Obama’s fundraising event, Pete Buttigieg, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, reprised the purity-test dodge on the debate stage. Senator Elizabeth Warren, also a candidate, pressed him on his ties to robber-baron donors, and he responded that this wasn’t fair game. To mention the opulence of his donor parties, he said, was nothing but a “purity test.” Five years later, sounding out politicians for their connections to billionaires doesn’t seem so persnickety. With their massively successful “Fight Oligarchy” national tour, which has drawn 261,100 attendees so far, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and good old Bernie have skillfully energized the party’s progressive grassroots and quietly reoriented the whole Democratic enterprise. Progressive Democrats no longer just oppose the bottomlessly corrupt billionaire in the White House. They oppose all billionaires, of every party, as they are all bottomlessly corrupt—and have long rigged politics and the economy to consolidate power, exploit workers, pursue white nationalism, and wage war. If Democrats, when asked, can’t commit to opposing oligarchy, they’re not failing purity tests. They’re hiding a dangerous and right-wing worldview, and Americans deserve to know about it. Socialism may have been sidelined in 2015, and again in 2019, but it’s on all the tickets now. Virginia Heffernan is the author of the Substack newsletter Magic + Loss.

Title: Bitcoin Vindicated: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Eats His Words

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has retracted his earlier statements criticizing Bitcoin (BTC) as a tool for money laundering and theft. Since his criticism, BlackRock has become the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with Fink evolving into a strong advocate of the premier cryptocurrency. After previously taking a hard stance toward Bitcoin, Larry Fink has reiterated a change of heart toward the largest cryptocurrency. In a recent interview, the BlackRock CEO admitted that his former views on Bitcoin were wrong, and new insights have forced a shift in perspective for digital assets.According to Fink, interactions with thousands of clients, including government leaders, as the BlackRock CEO revealed the upsides of Bitcoin. For Fink, Bitcoin is now an international asset class with the BlackRock CEO underscoring BTC’s inflation-hedging and borderless properties in several interviews. “I had very strong views,” said Fink. “But that doesn’t mean I’m not wrong. My thought process always evolves.” Back in 2017, Larry Fink described Bitcoin as an “index of money laundering” while dismissing it as speculation and “not a real investment.” In 2018, Fink noted that BlackRock had no interest in a Bitcoin ETF, maintaining that its clients were not keen on cryptocurrency exposure.Starting in 2020, Fink’s public comments indicated a streak of neutrality. In multiple interviews, the BlackRock CEO acknowledged Bitcoin’s potential but raised concerns over its volatility and dire lack of regulation. In the following years, Fink and BlackRock began paying significant attention to Bitcoin, mulling the possibilities of tokenization using blockchain technology. Things reached a crescendo in 2023 after BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, citing growing clients’ need for BTC exposure. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in early 2024, the ETF recorded a flying start. At the moment, IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with over $72 billion in assets under management (AUM), reflecting massive institutional interest in the asset class. Barely two years since its launch, Bitcoin ETFs are now BlackRock’s largest revenue drivers, surpassing revenue-generating two-decade-old products for the asset manager. For context, BlackRock manages over 1,600 ETFs globally, with IBIT on course to clinch $100 billion in AUM.

Title: Ripple CEO’s Ultra-Bullish Projection: Bitcoin To Reach $180,000 By End Of 2026

Bitcoin could extend its recent rebound after posting a 7% daily gain on Wednesday, with 2026 likely to be the crypto’s most bullish year yet. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse cited regulatory progress and institutional interest as the secret sauce for Bitcoin hitting $180,000 by the end of 2026. During a recent panel discussion alongside Solana Foundation President Lily Liu and Binance co-CEO Richard Teng as part of Binance Blockchain Week, Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse boldly projected that the Bitcoin price could grind all the way to $180,000 per coin before the end of next year. “I’ll go out on a limb, and I’ll say Bitcoin $180,000, December 31, 2026,” Garlinghouse postulated, indicating strong optimism about the alpha cryptocurrency’s long-term price trajectory. Bitcoin was trading for $93,216 at publication time, up a meagre 0.1 percentage over the past 24 hours period, CoinGecko data shows. The leading crypto hit a record peak of $126,080 just two months ago before sagging. The Ripple CEO expects 2026 to be the most bullish year for the crypto industry to date due to several factors. “There are so many macro factors that are continuing to provide tailwinds for this industry that, as we go into 2026, I don’t remember being this optimistic in the last handful of years,” he opined. First, Garlinghouse notes that after years of being hostile to the crypto sector, the United States has finally achieved regulatory clarity under the Trump administration. This drastic regulatory change, according to him, is significantly undervalued. Garlinghouse then highlighted that renowed Wall Street giants are now foraying the market. Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and now even Vanguard, which previously held a long-standing anti-crypto stance, is now allowing its 50 million clients to invest in regulated digital asset products. Crypto has transitioned beyond mere speculation into real-world utility. More improved interfaces and practical applications indicate that crypto is beginning to solve real problems. Per Garlinghouse, this will buoy a prolonged bull rally. “The last thing I’ll say on this (which I think we’ll probably all agree about) is we’re also seeing real-world applications, where it’s not just about the speculation,” he explained. Other industry pundits are less optimistic. As ZyCrypto reported last month, veteran trader Peter Brandt claimed BTC will not reach $200k by the end of this year as widely tipped by various strategists. For Brandt, the next bull run leading to that price level will take place over four years.

Economy Class & Beyond 05/12/2025 by Kevincm Leave a Comment Why yes, I’m trying to avoid writing something else. Or is it booking something else? So, a quick food adventure before I get back to booking something… In this Trip Report: It’s time for a poor-quality, unplanned food adventure post. Because people like food photos, ideas and my bad planning going up in flames. Some plans fell through the floor (be it from exhaustion from overstimulation or being awake for way too many hours), others… I’ll go into in-depth. I tend to stop here to stock up for a weekend, as filled Chinese meat buns are never a bad thing to have to nibble during quiet moments. I’ve written about this bakery before – and it’s a place I return to for supplies and snacks, since i learned about it in the Eater Documentary. Put it like this, it’s one of the main stops on my Chicago trips. I remember Paris Baguette (and quietly laughing at the name) when I went to Seoul in 2009 (and yes, it’s a South Korean Company). It seems the company has spread out since then, opening branches around the world. It sells a mixture of sweet and savoury items… and your author was in a savoury mood that day. The branch I visited was on the main street in Chinatown. But strangely, Paris Baguette was out of baugettes. Lonely baguette stand is lonely. I had a crab and a meat croquette. They were warm and filling for the price of $9. This is one I can’t review fairly, mainly because whilst uten siles were requested, they never turned up. Thus, all I could get was the Wonton soup, which was hot and passable. The Mongolian Beef was passable when it was cold, but I suspect it would have been better hot. It didn’t help that I couldn’t find my chopsticks to eat with. You’d think that at this point, I’d have multiple pairs of chopsticks within grabbing distance. Nope. Not a chance. Exhaustion got the better of me during this trip (again), so by 9 pm I had a choice – a disappointing order-in pizza, or head out to a decent pizza joint. And Peaquods Pizza is a decent and well-priced pizza joint. I grabbed one with Cheese, Sausage, Pepperoni and Giardiniera, with the meat adding protein, the Giardiniera adding acid to cut through the grease. And yes, it took me most of the week to polish it off when I got home. For those who remember the classic Olympic Grill sketch from Saturday Night Live, the Cheezborger! Cheezborger! Cheezborger! comes from The Bill Goat Tavern. I visited the “original” branch, which is under North Michigan Avenue. It’s not hard to find, head to the Plaza of Americas (behind The Wrigley Building) and take the right-hand stairs down. Turn around on yourself, and you’ll find the Tavern. They’ve got other branches in the area, so it might be worth seeking out one if you’re looking for a particular branch near you. I was basic. I had a single cheeseburger with Coke. The place had the atmosphere of a thousand conversations held, hushed or otherwise, with tales to tell. And it felt those stories were genuine, compared to larger chain places. As for the burger – well, a solid burger. With fixings to help yourself to (that I missed), with a Kaiser bun and a freshly cooked patty with melted cheese… It’s a pretty nice burger, at a reasonable price. And reasonable price is something that you don’t get sometimes in Central Chicago, unless you’re going to the big fast-food chains. Right. Onto normal travels. Time to head back to O’Hare.

Title: Korea’s Woori Bank Begins Displaying Bitcoin Price in Its Trading Room

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Woori Bank is now displaying Bitcoin prices in its main trading room in Seoul. On Dec. 5, South Korean multinational financial institution Woori Bank announced that it had begun to display the prices of Bitcoin BTC $89 295 24h volatility: 0.3% Market cap: $1.78 T Vol. 24h: $23.00 B in its main trading room in Seoul. It included won-dollar exchange rates and stock market data alongside. The trading room is a meeting place for market makers, where frontline trading of foreign exchange, bonds, and derivatives takes place. An official of the bank noted that the initiative is in response to the growing prominence of crypto. “As digital assets continue to grow in prominence and influence in global financial markets, we determined that they should be monitored as a key indicator to better read overall market trends,” the Woori Bank official stated. Interestingly, the financial ecosystem has been seeing a subtle push towards the integration of the Traditional Finance (TradFi) system and digital asset markets. There have been quite a number of alliances set to spark such integrations. Recently, American crypto exchange Kraken signed a strategic partnership deal with Deutsche Börse to bridge TradFi and crypto. Together, they intend to engage in trading, custody, settlement, collateral management, and tokenized assets. Similarly, Hana Financial Group and Dunamu signed an agreement recently to introduce blockchain technology to services such as overseas remittances. Woori Bank is yet to hint at an alliance with a crypto company, but its announcement signals deep interest in the digital asset world. One of the ways that the TradFi sector has been integrating with crypto is through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Top asset management firms with billions in Assets under management (AUM), like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Fidelity, have issued one or more crypto ETFs and are still looking to list more. A few days ago, Franklin Templeton’s Solana ETF officially began live trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca platform. It was listed under the ticker “SOEZ,” while its XRP ETF, which went live earlier, was listed as EZRP. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: ETH to $62,000? Tom Lee Is Ultra Bullish but Traders Watch These Numbers
URL: https://www.coinspeaker.com/eth-to-62000-tom-lee-is-ultra-bullish-but-traders-watch-these-numbers/

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BitMine’s Tom Lee predicts an ultra-bullish climb toward $62,000 for Ethereum following the Fusaka upgrade on Dec. 3. Tom Lee, the chairman of ETH ETH $3 013 24h volatility: 1.4% Market cap: $363.98 B Vol. 24h: $15.06 B holding company BitMine Immersion Technologies, believes that the crypto market has already survived its harshest correction phase. Speaking at Blockchain Week in Dubai, he argued that the pullback that began in October is over. Lee talked about previous cycles where similar drops resolved within six to eight weeks and added that the market is entering its reversal window. According to Lee, fears tied to quantum threats, liquidation cascades, and concerns around Tether and MicroStrategy contributed to the recent market anxiety. Yet he now sees evidence that market makers have stabilized. In his view, crypto’s bullish cycle will resume, and the traditional idea of Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycles no longer applies. When discussing Ethereum, Lee remained exceptionally optimistic and said that major financial institutions like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and others are building real-world asset tokenization rails on Ethereum. From his perspective, Ethereum is evolving into the core financial settlement layer of the global economy. He said that if Ethereum returns to its historical average ratio versus Bitcoin, ETH could trade near $12,000. A return to the 2021 peak ratio places ETH close to $22,000. But Lee’s most ambitious forecast assumes ETH grows into the backbone of worldwide settlement which could lift the ETH/BTC ratio toward 0.25 and push Ethereum to roughly $62,000. According to a recent release, the firm now holds more than $12 billion worth of Ether. Earlier today, Lookonchain revealed that BitMine had accumulated 41,946 ETH, worth about $130.78 million, at a price near $3,100. It seems that Tom Lee(@fundstrat)'s #Bitmine just bought another 41,946 $ETH($130.78M) 5 hours ago.https://t.co/adab0TBF5Phttps://t.co/bYWnrPoBLU pic.twitter.com/z8QPzY0q95 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2025 Analyst Ali Martinez took a more practical approach while sharing Lee’s words. While he acknowledged the possibility of a $62,000 ETH, the analyst argued that the market must first clear critical resistance levels. $62,000 $ETH!?? It could be… But first, Ethereum needs to break $4,800. And even then, the next key targets are $6,800 and $8,800. https://t.co/JQEazwCIzi pic.twitter.com/tl2wzaCKQ0 — Ali (@ali_charts) December 5, 2025 According to Martinez, Ethereum needs to break above $4,800 to unlock momentum. Beyond that, the next major targets lie at $6,800 and $8,800. Clearing these levels will make ETH the next crypto to explode in the next cycle. Meanwhile, according to CryptoQuant analysts, Ethereum’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio on Binance climbed to 0.998 immediately following the Fusaka network upgrade. This was the highest reading since early August. ETH taker buy sell ratio | Source: CryptoQuant A breakout above 1.0 would confirm the end of November’s correction and open the path toward the $3,500 and $4,000 zones. CryptoQuant also noted that Ethereum’s cumulative volume delta (CVD) on Binance has shown sharp spikes of buying interest, and the indicator is now in positive territory. Binance ETH CVD momentum and price correlation 30D | Source: CryptoQuant The 30-day correlation between price and CVD remains at a relatively high 0.6.

Title: Military preparedness 'best way to avoid war': President Lai
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2025/taiwan-251204-cna02.htm
Time Published: 2025-12-05T09:15:08Z
Full Content:
ROC Central News Agency 12/04/2025 02:49 PM Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA) President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸ å¾·) said in a U.S. media interview that Taiwan is "working side by side" with other democracies to deter a Chinese invasion and "robust preparations are the best way to avoid war and achieve peace." Speaking in a prerecorded video interview, which aired Wednesday (U.S. time) at The New York Times DealBook Summit, Lai said that "peace is priceless and war has no winners." "While we aspire to peace, we cannot harbor illusions about it," Lai told interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin, the Taiwanese president's first foreign media interview since he announced a US$40 billion special defense budget on Nov. 26. "Peace must be secured through strength. This is why we are increasing our defense budget and strengthening our national defense capabilities while also cutting back our economic dependence on China," Lai added. Taiwan's president was one of more than a dozen interviewees at the Times' event, which also featured conversations with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, and California Governor Gavin Newsom. In the interview, which lasted around 10 minutes, Sorkin asked Lai about China's goal of being capable of "taking Taiwan by force by 2027" and what he thought China's current timeline could be. "Whatever timeline China's People's Liberation Army may have, Taiwan's fundamental principle is that we must be ready first," Lai added, before expressing gratitude to the international community for their support of Taiwan. The well-known American journalist then asked Lai how confident he felt about U.S. President Donald Trump's support for Taiwan. "Our relationship truly is rock solid," Lai said of the long-standing relationship between the two sides, adding that U.S. cooperation with Taiwan has expanded since Trump assumed office. On the Russia-Ukraine war, Lai said Taiwan stands with the people of Ukraine, and that he hopes "this irrational and illegitimate war will be over as soon as possible so that the Ukrainian people will no longer have to suffer." "However, in ending this war, we also hope that Ukraine's national dignity and the well-being of its people will be respected and future conflict will be prevented," Lai explained. Sorkin, a financial columnist for The New York Times and co-anchor of CNBC's business news show "Squawk Box," turned the interview to the topic of semiconductors. Noting the Trump administration's desire to manufacture "40 to 50 percent of all semiconductors in the next couple of years," Sorkin asked whether Lai was concerned about Taiwan potentially being "less valuable" to the U.S. in the future. Lai said that "semiconductors are a global ecosystem" and that he hopes that Taiwan can "support the re-industrialization of the U.S." through investments in the country. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and other Taiwanese semiconductor firms invest in the U.S., Japan, Europe, or "wherever they believe is needed," Lai said. On the question of whether Trump's 40 to 50 percent domestic semiconductor manufacturing goal was realistic or not, Lai said that this would depend on the U.S. government's ability to facilitate land, water and electricity supply, workforce and talent development, and investment incentives. Later in the interview, Lai said that Taiwan's decision around the year 2000 not to relocate its most advanced manufacturing to China was correct. He also said that leaders around the world should work together to "take steps to prevent AI from becoming a bubble" so that the industry can drive long-term global growth.

Title: The Germans Are World Champions for Rearmament
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/germans-world-champions-rearmament/5907888
Time Published: 2025-12-05T07:22:28Z
Full Content:
Every year, not only does Santa Claus come around, but also a report on global arms production and trade by SIPRI. SIPRI stands for Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The international peace research institute in Sweden’s capital has now taken a close look at the sales and profits of arms companies[1]. And it turns out that never before in human history has so much money been spent on armaments as it is now. Some of the increases in sales can be described as exorbitant. Or should we say obscene? At a time when sheer deprivation in certain areas, such as Gaza, has reached absolutely unbearable levels; at a time when farmland is becoming infertile and forests are being destroyed; at a time when education and healthcare can no longer keep pace with the increasing challenges – at such a time, many governments have the audacity to literally vaporize more and more taxpayers’ money on armament. This can only be good news for arms manufacturers, their shareholders and asset managers. SIPRI has only included the hundred largest arms manufacturers in its calculations. So these figures do not document the full extent of the economic waste. Nevertheless, for the year 2024, we arrive at the staggering sum of 676 billion dollars that has been diverted from the coffers of the taxpayer solidarity community into the pockets of arms profiteers. That was almost six per cent more than a year earlier. Mind you, we are only talking about the purchase of new weapons and ammunition here. Not the maintenance of equipment and buildings. Not the personnel costs and retirement pensions for former soldiers, the often traumatised or maimed veterans of various perverse excursions to foreign countries. First of all, it is interesting to observe the large regional differences in the purchase of new war toys. It will come as no surprise that US-based arms manufacturers, with an order volume of 336 billion US dollars, account for the lion’s share of the business with 49 per cent. And anyone who already has such a dominant position can be satisfied with year-on-year growth of around four per cent. However, US companies would be wise not to rest on their laurels too much. After all, the relatively slow growth of the US arms industry may well be its own fault. Table leader Lockheed Martin has severely tested the patience of its customers with its F-35 fighter jet. The F-35 is delivered to customers on average three quarters of a year after the promised delivery date. And then the metal bird is significantly more expensive than originally promised. It is precisely this unreliability that is also attributed to other arms manufacturers Made in the USA. This is not exactly helpful for long-term customer loyalty. A study from the United States had already complained in 2009 that the government awards arms contracts without tenders[2]. And that every member of Congress in Washington only approves an arms project if it creates jobs for their constituency. Arms projects are therefore not planned with a view to finding the best technical solution. Instead, the aim is to find a solution that all members of Congress can agree on. It could therefore be that the enormously inflated American war machine is a paper tiger. We will see if this is the case when the US eventually encounters a truly equal opponent. The real action in the arms industry is currently taking place in Europe. The war in Ukraine is seen as a suitable pretext to really show off. As a result, the business of European arms companies rose by 13 per cent in 2024 compared to the previous year. Overall, European killers are represented in the Top One Hundred chart with 151 billion dollars and a 22 per cent market share. Twenty-six European companies share the pie. With BAE Systems, the United Kingdom has a real heavyweight in fourth place in the world rankings with 52.2 billion dollars and growth of 7.7 per cent. With sales of $26 billion and growth of 12 per cent, France has just half the potential of the British. New entry to the charts is the Czechoslovak Group, with a phenomenal 193 per cent increase in sales and a value of $3.6 billion. The Czech arms manufacturer owes this meteoric rise to lucrative orders from Ukraine. The Ukrainian defence contractor JSC Ukrainian Defence Industry posted a 41 per cent increase in sales last year, with a turnover of three billion dollars. Russia, on the other side, has lost market share on the international export market. However, this is being offset by its involvement on the Ukrainian front. The Russian arms industry is concentrated in the state-owned Rostec corporation. However, Rostec’s turnover is only slightly higher than that of French corporations, namely 27.1 billion dollars, with growth of 26 per cent[3]. The Russian defence budget is actually rather modest, and is even set to be reduced next year. In order to inflate the destructive power of the Russian bear, the German media are repeatedly reporting that Russia wants to increase its budget for 2026 to a whopping 12.93 trillion roubles[3]. However, they fail to convert this amount into euros. This is because one rouble is equivalent to one euro cent[4]. The Russians therefore want to spend around 129 billion euros on their defence next year. That is less than a tenth of what the Western community of values spends on its armaments. While Japan and South Korea are also recording fabulous growth with their arms companies, developments in China are moving in the opposite direction. With a total volume of 88.3 billion dollars, Chinese arms companies have suffered a ten per cent decline compared to the previous year. However, this is not the result of an increasingly pacifist attitude in China – unfortunately not. Rather, the Chinese arms industry has been rocked by a huge corruption scandal. Large numbers of senior staff have had to be dismissed. And now a restructuring process is underway that is paralysing the industry for a certain period of time. However, this should have settled down again by next year. You may well have wondered whether, in the heat of the moment, I might have forgotten Germany. Not at all. I am now turning my attention specifically to Germany. This is because the German arms industry stands out in all this arms race madness. Germany has a total of four arms companies in the top one hundred. And only the Czech Republic, as already mentioned, has higher growth rates than Germany. The Diehl Group increased its share by 53 per cent to 2.1 billion dollars. And the much better-known Rheinmetall Group, ranked 20th in the charts, increased its share by 47 per cent to 8.2 billion. Plans assume that Rheinmetall could move up to second place in the ranking of the world’s largest arms companies in a few years. This is very strange, however. German politicians are actively promoting the unilateral restructuring of their own economy towards militarisation. While Germany is showing serious signs of increasing deindustrialisation, the federal government is willingly allowing this undesirable development to happen. It is simply pushing an arms industry as a new model over the flattened civilian economy. And because an exorbitant increase in the military budget cannot be financed from the regular federal budget, they are simply brazenly ignoring the debt brake, which has so far been used to reject pretty much every funding measure in the areas of education, health and infrastructure. A ‘special fund’, i.e. rapid debt accumulation outside and parallel to the federal budget. In the coming fiscal year 2026, 108.2 billion euros are actually to be squandered on armament[5]. Around 80 billion euros will come from the regular federal budget pot. An additional 25 billion euros will come from the so-called special fund. To pay for this, pensioners, among others, will have to tighten their belts. Other areas will also have to tighten their belts. With this model, the German government is following in the footsteps of the United States after the Second World War. At that time, just a few years after the fighting ended, a gigantic military-industrial complex was built up, which gradually stifled the civilian economy more and more. The USA no longer produced for civilian purposes. Everything that was not nailed down was imported: food, consumer goods. Because less and less was being invested in broad-based development, the USA brought in skilled workers from abroad – a phenomenon known as brain drain. The USA could afford to do this because, after the Second World War, it had gathered the rest of the world around it and was able to dictate the rules of the game. With the dollar as the reserve currency, the US was able to gain advantages that no other country in the world is allowed to enjoy. The US was able to determine the terms of the oil trade at its own discretion. And if any country in the world refused to accept the Pax Americana, there were harsh punitive expeditions and regime change manoeuvres. Have the German elites not understood anything? A complete conversion of the economy into a military-industrial complex is something you have to be able to afford. Germany is not the centre of the world. Germany is a decapitated limb of the American power machine. The German military will never be in a position to subjugate other countries and cover them with punitive expeditions. Meanwhile, Germany has repeatedly attempted to become the hegemon in the European Union. However, these attempts have failed miserably time and again, falling short halfway. The attempt to break out of the dead end of deindustrialisation through militarisation is doomed to failure from the outset. We can already write off Germany’s military power as a pitiful ruin. It may be that the failure of this project to establish Germany as a military power will cause the elites to flee, leaving a political vacuum, just as in 1918. If we can counter this militaristic nonsense with a concept of civil society, there will be a unique opportunity for a more humane Germany. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Reddit's CEO says the platform is ditching a key part that 'sucks'

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reddit is getting rid of one of its oldest fixtures. The platform's CEO, Steve Huffman, said in a post that Reddit would be removing its r/popular feed from the homepage for new users to promote a more personalized and relevant user experience. The popular feed, located on the left sidebar of the website, displays the most liked recent posts across the platform. "In theory, it's what's most popular on Reddit, but it's actually what is liked by the most active users on Reddit—which is not the same thing," he said. "Having it as a default feed gives the false impression of a singular Reddit culture, one that is neither representative of Reddit nor appealing to new users (or anyone at all, IMO)." He summed up his disdain for the feature by saying, "r/popular sucks, and we're moving away from it, and towards better, more relevant and personalized feeds." Huffman, who has been the platform's CEO since 2015, said Reddit would stop showing the popular feed in the sidebar unless users read it regularly. He said his favorite part of Reddit was that every community on the platform had its own unique culture, rules, and sense of humor. "And if your perspective isn't represented, you can create the community you want to see," he said. "The freedom to build your own corner of the internet is what makes Reddit, Reddit." The platform gets 116 million visitors daily, he said. Reddit's stock price has risen about 44% in the past year. In the post, he announced a few other changes, like limiting the number of high-traffic communities a single person can moderate, and changing the way it shows community sizes. "These changes are all part of the same goal: making Reddit more conducive to how people actually use it today," he said. This is not Reddit's first effort to nudge its users into smaller community groups, as it recalibrates its platform alongside competitors like Quora, and beyond that, the likes of Meta. In October, Reddit removed its public chat feature and urged users to chat on private group chats as a way to "connect with communities in smaller, focused spaces." Jump to

Title: Bitcoin Dip Attracts Gradual Buying From Sovereign Funds—CEO

Reports have disclosed a sharp rebound in crypto markets this week, with Bitcoin jumping 8% to trade above $93,000 after sliding from lows under $85,000 earlier in the week. Traders are watching the Federal Reserve’s December actions closely as they try to gauge how much liquidity will return to markets. The move pushed bitcoin back within reach of a roughly $2 trillion market cap. According to BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, several sovereign wealth funds have been quietly adding to positions as prices fell from a peak near $126,000. “There are a number of sovereign funds that are standing by…. and they’re buying ‘incrementally’ as the Bitcoin price has retreated from its $126,000 peak,” Fink said. He said these buyers are taking a gradual approach — adding over time rather than making quick bets — and treating holdings as multi-year positions. Reports have disclosed that public funds in Abu Dhabi and Luxembourg have bought into BlackRock’s IBIT bitcoin fund in recent months. Fink warned that markets remain skewed and that volatility will persist while many players remain highly leveraged. Fink has been vocal about tokenization as a major theme for the coming years. Based on reports, he wrote in The Economist that tokenization could grow as quickly as the internet did in its early days, noting that Amazon had only $16 million in sales in 1996. BlackRock, the $10 trillion asset manager he runs, has pushed the idea that a digital wallet could one day hold stocks, bonds and tokenized assets together. Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said some of the largest banks are already working with Coinbase on stablecoins, custody and trading services, though he did not name the banks. According to remarks made at a DealBook event alongside Andrew Ross Sorkin and Brian Armstrong, Fink described bitcoin in emotional terms: ownership often reflects worries about physical safety or financial security. He tied demand to concerns over the debasement of financial assets and rising deficits. Reports have also quoted him warning that the US risks falling behind other governments if it does not speed up adoption of tokenization and other digital tools. US President Donald Trump has similarly warned about competition from China in crypto innovation. Traders are already pricing in a variety of scenarios. Some are betting on a major development in 2026 that could reshape demand; others remain focused on short-term policy moves from the Fed. Bitcoin’s recent 8% gain was the largest daily jump since May, but it came after sharp swings that highlighted how quickly positions can reverse. With significant capital now involved — and big names publicly backing tokenization — the market is likely to see more headline-driven moves.

Title: A Meta Success; From Paradise To Ad Placements

Next Verse Remember when it seemed like the metaverse was going to be the next big thing in immersive technology and internet marketing? Yeah, about that. Four years after rebranding itself for this seemingly inevitable future, Meta has announced plans to significantly cut back on metaverse spending within its Reality Labs division. Bloomberg reports that Reality Labs, which includes the Quest VR device and “Meta Horizon Worlds” product, could see potential budget cuts as high as 30% and layoffs as early as January. Instead, that money will likely be redirected to Meta’s other potentially groundbreaking, definitely-not-just-hype-powered projects, like its AI initiatives and wearable smart glasses. “It’s not that marketers were necessarily wrong to be fascinated by Meta’s metaverse vision – just that the ending was obvious from the start, if we’re being honest with ourselves. To paraphrase “Folding Ideas” creator Dan Olson, the modern internet already handles most of the functions envisioned within the original sci-fi concept of the metaverse, so the idea that people are going to wander around in what is essentially a badly rendered, purposeless MMO game was never going to be sustainable. In other words, you’re probably better off putting your ad dollars in Roblox instead. Apple’s Road Map For Road Maps They say you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone, and that might be truest of all when talking about ads. They paved paradise and put up … search ads. Back in October, Apple started hinting that Apple Maps – a heretofore ad-free platform – will introduce search ads next year, much to the chagrin of many users. It’s a fitting metaphor, really – because there’s only so much real estate left online. No wonder marketers are getting desperate. As search traffic continues to plummet, their online advertising budgets “[have] to go somewhere,” Raj Lala, VP of US sales and development at Vistar Media, tells Emarketer. Navigation platforms are likely to be one of those places, he observed. But on a brighter note for consumers, most people find location-based ads less invasive than those that track browser history. Plus, Apple is good at “ensuring that the brands that are surfacing in these environments are going to be highly vetted, filtered and relevant,” said Lala. That’s something. At least when you see a dozen sponsored results for “restaurants near me” next time you open Apple Maps, the restaurants really will be near you. Go With The Stream Advertisers will never successfully end the fragmentation of streaming media for one simple reason: Roku, Paramount, Netflix, Comcast et al. will never agree to expose their data to cross-channel buyers. The more realistic option is not that they share data, but that the biggest players keep buying up smaller services until only a manageable handful of platforms remain. This has already been happening for some time, albeit slowly. Disney consolidated Fox and Hulu, while Amazon Prime Video bought MGM Studios. And now there’s another big prize on the table in the form of Warner Bros. Discovery. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast are bidding for a chance to fold HBO Max and the WBD studio archive into their own libraries. For CTV advertisers who only want quality supply, the entity that ends up acquiring a service like HBO matters a lot, including their approach to ad load, the types of ad formats they offer and their ad-supported subscriber counts. On the other hand, Paramount CEO David Ellison just sent a letter denouncing WBD’s deal process, The Wall Street Journal reports, calling it “tilted and unfair.” The unspoken wild card here, though, is party politics. The Ellisons are allies of President Trump and Paramount boasts of having the cleanest, easiest path to an approved deal. Netflix has the highest bid for WBD, but Reid Hoffman, the company’s co-founder and former CEO, is a Democratic donor. Maybe the future of streaming media comes down less to CPMs and more to campaign contributions. But Wait! There’s More Cyber Monday takes the cake for the biggest online shopping day of the year.

Title: ECB frets at prospect of Trump ally running US central bank
URL: https://www.politico.eu/article/ecb-frets-prospect-donald-trump-ally-running-us-central-bank/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T03:14:00Z
Full Content:
A politicized Fed could be bad news for central banks everywhere, officials fear. AI generated Text-to-speech European Central Bank officials are growing increasingly jittery as Kevin Hassett — a close ally of President Donald Trump with very little central bank experience — emerges as the frontrunner to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve. A report last week by Bloomberg described Hassett, whom Trump picked at the start of the year to head the White House National Economic Council, as the “emerging front-runner” to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Hassett’s rise has set off alarm bells in Frankfurt. European officials fear Hassett, under pressure from his boss in the White House, could push the Fed into cutting interest rates far more aggressively than Powell — even though that might risk unleashing another wave of inflation that could ripple out across the world. “If markets obtain a firm belief that the new [Fed chair] is subject to fiscal or any other dominance at the expense of the inflation target, there will be capital flight from the U.S. and an erosion of the value of the dollar with serious consequences worldwide — including higher inflation,” one ECB official said. Like others interviewed for this story, the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “There is a possibility that the U.S. will have some inflationary bias ... because of the political involvement,” a second ECB official warned. The Bloomberg report came just before Thanksgiving, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had whittled down a long roster of candidates into a shorter list. Later during the holiday weekend, aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters that “I know who I’m gonna pick,” but he told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that he wouldn’t announce his decision until early in the new year. Prediction markets such as Polymarket have made Hassett the odds-on favorite since then. “For Trump, Hassett would be the best choice,” a third ECB official agreed, noting the candidate’s political proximity to the White House. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed since returning to office in January, blasting Powell — whom he appointed as Chair during his first term — as a “numbskull” and a “major loser” for not cutting interest rates more quickly. The Fed withstood the pressure until September, when signs of a slowdown in the labor market emerged. It cut rates again in October, but Powell upset those expecting more easing soon by warning that another cut in December is by no means “a done deal.” Since then, several of his colleagues on the Federal Open Markets Committee have expressed reluctance to cut any further in December, pointing to an inflation rate stuck above the 2 percent target. Usually, when the labor market weakens, so does inflation, but that hasn’t happened this time. At both of his last two press conferences, Powell noted that the Fed’s dual mandate of keeping prices stable while pursuing full employment were currently “in tension” with each other. Hassett has presented a very different view, telling CNBC in November that “inflation has come way down” from the 5 percent that it averaged during Joe Biden’s presidency andthat “the trajectory is really, really, really good if you look at it.” That’s despite U.S. headline inflation actually rising in four of the last five months. That is why many in Frankfurt see alternative candidates — including the dovish but experienced Fed Governor Christopher Waller — as far safer choices. Also still in the running, according to various sources, are former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, BlackRock fixed-income chief Rick Rieder, and sitting Governor Michelle Bowman. For decades, relations between the Fed and the ECB have been collegial and cooperative. Members of the small, globally connected circle of central bankers have long seen themselves as a kind of fraternity. During the height of the 2008 financial crisis, then-ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet liked to emphasize that closeness by repeatedly referring to Fed Chair Ben Bernanke as “my good friend Ben.” More recently, as Powell has come under fire from the White House, European colleagues have rushed to defend him. Lagarde told a Washington Post event in April that “I have … enormous respect for Chair Powell, and I know that he’s doing exactly what’s expected of him to serve the American people.” Deutsche Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel echoed such comments more recently. Outside the eurozone, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey — another central banker anxious about the risk of financial volatility — called Powell “a man of the utmost integrity.” With Powell’s departure looming, ECB officials increasingly fear that this long-standing, trust-based relationship may be nearing its end, a fourth official told POLITICO. These concerns have already begun to influence the ECB’s strategic considerations in other areas, including liquidity policies and its own leadership succession. The ECB declined to comment. (Additional reporting by Ben Munster) The attractiveness of alternative backstops is rising in a financial system that may be losing its anchor. Central bank president delivers a rueful “told you so” But Germany may also want a say in the race to replace Christine Lagarde. Tentative signs of a stable recovery will allow for a stable rate policy, Austria’s new central banker tells POLITICO.

Title: Ripple CEO Predicts 2026 Will Be A Breakout Year For Crypto

Time Published: 2025-12-05T03:00:27Z

At Binance Blockchain Week on December 3, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse argued that a rare alignment of regulatory change, institutional demand and real-world utility is setting up crypto for what he called powerful “macro tailwinds” heading into 2026. “I personally will echo some of the things Richard said: there are so many macro factors that are continuing to provide tailwinds for this industry that I think as we go into 2026 I don’t remember being this optimistic in the last handful of years,” the Ripple CEO told CNBC’s Dan Murphy, speaking alongside Binance CEO Richard Teng and Solana Foundation President Lily Liu. He framed the latest drawdown not as the start of a structural bear market but as a risk-off interlude against a fundamentally improved backdrop. “Crypto has gone through cycles and when you have risk-on people are excited […] now you have kind of a risk-off moment, there’s uncertainty,” he said. The difference this time, he argued, is that the United States—the largest single economy and roughly “22% of global GDP”—is finally moving away from what he described as years of open hostility toward the sector. “This is a market that has been really openly hostile to crypto for four or five years or maybe longer, and now you have that that has changed significantly, pretty quickly,” he said. Institutions, in his view, are only beginning to adjust. He pointed to the visible presence of traditional asset managers at the event: “You saw Franklin Templeton on stage here, you saw BlackRock on stage just this week. I think Vanguard has now opened up […] Vanguard historically has said ‘we won’t touch crypto’ and now they’ve had a massive sea change.” On crypto ETFs, the Ripple CEO rejected the idea that the trade was over-hyped. “Definitely no,” he said when asked whether the ETF “floor” narrative had been exaggerated. He stressed how new these vehicles still are in the United States and highlighted early demand for XRP products. “In the last two or three weeks over $700 million have flowed into XRP ETFs, which is just pent-up demand from institutional investors, from investors who want access because they don’t want to custody themselves,” he said. He argued that the key metric is crypto’s still-small slice of the overall ETF universe. “The total ETF market—only one or two percent of the total ETF market is crypto. I will bet anybody here that a year from now that will be more than one or two percent,” he said. Short-term outflows from Bitcoin products, he suggested, should be viewed in context: “Over 2026 do we really think crypto ETFs are only going to be one or two percent of the total ETF market? No chance.” Garlinghouse said Ripple’s own prime brokerage business is already seeing that shift in behavior. Institutions that had remained “on the sidelines” due to regulatory uncertainty or risk aversion are now “getting involved and they’re starting small, and they’re going to walk, then they’re going to crawl—or crawl then walk then run.” Asked directly whether recent volatility had deterred institutional capital, he replied: “Definitely not.” Stablecoins were another pillar of his 2026 thesis. He agreed that in the latest risk-off phase, capital largely rotated into stablecoins rather than exiting on-chain rails, which he said reflects both utility and trust. “People are recognizing stablecoins can be stable and easier to manage,” he said. Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple’s own stablecoin, launched “just over a year ago,” has “just passed about a billion market cap,” is “approved and whitelisted in Abu Dhabi,” and is being used as “good collateral on various platforms from a lending point of view.” For him, stablecoins are an entry ramp to broader adoption, alongside other applications that will be built across Solana, Binance and Ripple ecosystems. On US policy, he said the trajectory has clearly improved, especially for payment tokens. He cited the GENIUS Act as “regulatory clarity for stablecoins” and linked it to growing corporate interest in on-chain payments. After Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury, which has visibility into “over 10 trillion dollars of payments,” he said “the number of those customers that are already approaching us interested in leveraging stablecoins […] because of that clarity, people are leaning in.” The Ripple CEO noted that XRP has already received a form of clarity from US federal courts but said broader legislation is still needed. He referenced the “Clarity Act” for crypto, saying there is “still forward momentum” and predicting that “sometime in the first half of next year we’ll see passage of legislation, which will continue to unlock and create more tailwinds for the whole industry.” He closed with an explicit price target for the next cycle, acknowledging he was “going out on a limb”: “I’ll say Bitcoin $180,000 December 23rd—or December 31st—2026.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.15.

Title: Crypto bounces as the macro market remains uncertain: Will it sustain?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=551291
Time Published: 2025-12-05T01:00:30Z
Full Content:
A sustained growth in spot demand and OI is necessary to drive the next rally. The crypto market saw a 10.4% bounce in total market capitalization since the swift price drop in the early hours of Monday. Bitcoin [BTC] led the charge, gaining 10.55%. Some altcoins have posted greater returns. The U.S. government reopened on the 13th of November, after a 43-day pause. This threw a monkey wrench into the machinery, as the market was missing some key information. Some reports were being released. For example, on Wednesday, payroll processor ADP said that private employers shed 32,000 jobs in November. In contrast, economists expected an increase of 40,000 jobs. On the bright side, the Federal Reserve officially ended its quantitative tightening (QT). The stock market also had a positive performance on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 up 0.3% for the day. The Bank of America and BlackRock asserted that the AI boom was driven by real corporate investment, and not irrational exuberance that drove the dot-com bubble. The current environment was described as more of an “air pocket” than a bubble by Bank of America’s head of equity and research. These developments showed that the already volatile crypto-sphere was being tugged at in different directions by the indecisive macro conditions as well. Source: TOTAL on TradingView The total crypto market cap fell below $3.56 trillion, a key support level, in September. It continued to trend downward, but something interesting happened over the past two weeks. The trendline support (yellow) from November 2023 was breached in November. The retest of the same level as resistance, surprisingly, did not reject the total market cap. It served as support once again in recent days. Perhaps the crypto bounce could continue in the coming weeks. Source: CoinGlass The Open Interest behind Bitcoin has slowly grown over the past three days, but it was still shallow compared to the October highs. A lack of speculative interest showed that market confidence was still low, and bullish bets were not as big as earlier. A sustained growth in spot demand and OI is necessary to drive the next rally. Until then, investors and traders can treat the bounce as a bounce and not expect a full recovery.

Title: Ten decor drops from legacy raids and dungeons to pick up on Player Housing day one (or right now)

NEXT | The Queue: As yet I have found no werewolves Cruising through old World of Warcraft content is something that I’ve loved doing for many years for the transmog, pets, and mounts, and now we can add Player Housing decor to the list of things you can pick up in legacy dungeons and raids. While there’s a surprisingly short list of adornments from the first eleven chapters of our journeys across Azeroth that are known to drop from bosses so far, it’s a safe bet that more will be added in the coming months and years. These decor items are guaranteed drops, so no tedious grinding is necessary for your first copy. Dungeons will have their last boss drop the decor item, but any boss from a raid could drop a furnishing. If you’re looking for multiple copies of any of these items, it’s a simple as running the instance again for a second or third (or 20th) copy of the item. Here is the list of decor I have on my launch day wish list. Valdrakken Hanging Lamp — After a quick run through the Ruby Life Pools, you’ll be able to hang an indoor-only glass sphere of enchanted fire from your rafters. The long rope gives this versatility, but the five colored gems really set it apart from the multitude of other lighting options. Magistrix’s Garden Fountain — Just a few bosses into The Nighthold is where you’ll encounter Spellblade Aluriel, who will now drop a stylish stone water feature each time you defeat her. You can place a large one front-and-center in your yard, but I’m excited to see what creative hijinks the community gets up to by taking advantage of this item’s ability to also be placed inside. Eye of Acherus — If you’re planning on using your home as a base for raising an army of undead and training them in the ways of the Death Knight, you’ll want one of these smoking blue orbs with its stylish skull-and-chain holder from the Pit of Saron. It’s a must-have for rooms with an Icecrown theme or as a Hallow’s End yard decoration. This one isn’t included in the Early Access, so we’ll have to wait for Midnight’s launch to obtain it. Tome of Pandaren Wisdom — I have already seen some amazing player-built features such as gaming tables and cozy reading nooks. This book bound in wood and red yarn found in the Temple of the Jade Serpent should give a little flair to any personal library or nightstand, and can even be placed outside for a bit of light Lorewalking in the shade. Gnomish Tesla Tower — Clearing Operation: Mechagon on any difficulty will net you this amazing electrical contraption that could be perfect for an interior workshop space or atop the pinnacle of your house as a lightning rod or weather station. This is an absolute necessity for any Gnome-themed area on your property. Crucible Votive — Here’s something perfect for setting just the right mood in your drawing room. If you’ll be running a murder mystery party, crafting an enormous pipe organ, or simply looking to furnish your dedicated brooding space, this rack of 46 candles drops from the Restless Cabal in the Crucible of Storms. This one is also absent from the Early Access period, so put it on your list for Midnight’s launch week. Tidesage’s Fireplace — While you’re vanquishing the tentacled horrors of Stormsong Valley, you can pop over to the Shrine of the Storm and pick up this stunning full-wall masterpiece. Don’t even think about putting the finishing touches on any nautical-themed sitting parlor without this enormous green cephalopod adorning your mantle. Horde Warlord’s Throne — We’ll wrap up with a trio of Horde-themed decor for anyone looking to put an extra zug zug into their floorplan. You’ll have to get all the way through Siege of Orgrimmar to earn Garrosh Hellscream’s personal seat, but it will certainly be worth the effort to use it as a centerpiece in your great hall or to lord over your weekly lawn darts tournament. Orgrimmar Sconce — Skulloc in the Iron Docks is the source for this wall-mounted horn that holds up a flaming spiked cage on a thick metal chain. Lining a hallway or dining room with these is sure to get your name on the shortlist to be the next Chief Interior Decorator of the Horde Forces. Horde Battle Emblem — Here’s the perfect item to mount above your horned Warlord Throne. Clearing Upper Blackrock Spire will reward you with this axe/shield combo that can also be placed outside to the annoyance of your Alliance-biased HOA. Originally published November 27, 2025.

Title: Canton Network Creator Snags Strategic Investment from Wall Street Giants

Digital Asset, the blockchain firm behind the Canton Network (CC), said Thursday that it has secured strategic investments from four major traditional financial players, as Wall Street's crypto embrace continues. The investors in this round were BNY, a financial services firm overseeing $57 trillion in client assets, exchange operator Nasdaq, financial intelligence firm S&P Global and iCapital, a fintech firm backed by BlackRock, Blackstone and JP Morgan. The company did not disclose the size of the investment in the press release. The investment underscores the growing support of legacy financial firms for blockchain infrastructure built specifically for regulated markets. The Canton Network was designed to enable institutions to issue and trade tokenized real-world assets, such as bonds, loans, and funds, on a shared ledger while maintaining privacy and compliance with legal requirements. It combines features of public blockchains, such as decentralization, with the safeguards required by traditional finance. “Institutions across the financial ecosystem recognize the necessity of blockchain infrastructure purpose-built for regulated markets," Yuval Rooz, CEO of Digital Asset, said in a statement. " The latest investment comes on the heels of Digital Asset's $135 million funding round in June, which was led by major firms including BNP Paribas, TradeWeb, Goldman Sachs, DRW, and Citadel Securities. Canton currently boasts $6 trillion of assets onchain with over 600 institutions participating across the ecosystem, the firm said.

Title: Kraken Partners With Deutsche Börse as Europe Looks to Rival Wall Street in Crypto

Time Published: 2025-12-04T20:38:59Z
Full Content:
Deutsche Börse Group (DBG) and Kraken announced on Thursday that they are combining forces, signaling a clear acceleration of institutional cryptocurrency adoption in the Eurozone. “This partnership is the clearest signal yet that institutional adoption is accelerating, and that Europe intends to compete on equal footing with Wall Street as this transformation moves from millions to billions,” Gurpreet Oberoi, Kraken Head of Institutional, told Coindesk. “Institutions across Europe aren’t just experimenting with digital assets anymore, they’re building real strategies, and they need infrastructure that matches the scale of their ambitions,” Oberoi added, noting that the partnership is "powerful validation of that shift." By combining Kraken’s proven crypto-native expertise and U.S. market access with the trust and systemic importance of DBG’s regulated derivatives clearing, Eurex, and custody arm, Clearstream, which has more than $23 trillion in assets under custody, are building a comprehensive, full-stack bridge designed to capture institutional flow, the companies said in the press release. Following the Trump Administration’s GENIUS Act, which provided the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins, Wall Street has moved at an unprecedented pace. Corporate giants like BlackRock, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Fidelity have been quick to provide their institutional clients with exposure to crypto. Several of them have issued BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have recently become a top revenue source for some. While Europe isn't far behind, DBG — generally seen as the single largest and most essential financial market infrastructure conglomerate in the Eurozone — is among financial institutions in the region that are working to match their U.S. counterparts. In September, the group signed a memorandum of understanding with Circle Internet Group to bring regulated stablecoins into Europe’s financial market infrastructure. More recently, on Nov. 18, Deutsche Börse Group and Societe Generale-FORGE signed an agreement to bring regulated euro and dollar stablecoins into the systems that support some of Europe’s largest financial markets. The new partnership between DBG and Kraken serves as a structural declaration that Europe's financial core is committed to directly challenging U.S. dominance in the emerging digital capital markets, according to the press release. The race for institutional crypto adoption is underway, but it’s not a recent phenomenon and is not exclusive to Wall Street and Europe either. The institutional acceptance of crypto around the world is accelerating significantly, developing hand in hand with better-defined regulation, BlockFills CEO Nick Hammer said in an interview with CoinDesk.

Title: Employers have cut 1.1 million jobs this year. Here's why.
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/employers-cut-1-1-million-jobs-2025-why-layoffs-rising/
Time Published: 2025-12-04T18:41:48Z

Watch CBS News Updated on: December 4, 2025 / 3:55 PM EST / CBS News Employers have cut more than 1.1 million jobs through November, the most since 2020, when companies laid off 2.2 million workers as the pandemic was slamming the U.S. economy, according to a new report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The layoffs represent a 54% increase from the same period a year earlier, when employers cut 761,358 jobs, according to the firm. It's also only the sixth time since 1993 that job cuts during the first 11 months of the year have risen above 1.1 million. Here's what is driving the increase in 2025 layoffs, according to Challenger. The technology sector is leading this year's job cuts, laying off 153,536 workers through November, according to Challenger. That's a 17% jump from the 130,701 layoffs tech firms announced by the same point in 2024. Amazon is among the tech firms that have announced substantial workforce reductions. In October, the company said it would cut 14,000 jobs as it leans on AI tools to boost efficiency. The retail sector reduced its workforce by 91,954 jobs through November, as consumers grapple with higher prices and pull back on spending on discretionary goods. While retailers typically ramp up hiring toward year-end to accommodate holiday shoppers, 2025 is shaping up to be the weakest in 15 years for seasonal work. Retail stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers this year, down from the 442,000 seasonal hires companies brought on last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization. These are the other sectors with the largest number of job cuts: Layoffs from the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were a primary driver of job cuts, leading to nearly 300,000 job losses this year, according to the Challenger report. DOGE, a cost-cutting effort, reduced both funding and employment at some federal agencies earlier this year. DOGE accounted for another 21,000 indirect job cuts at private and nonprofit entities that lost federal funding. Market and economic conditions were cited as the cause behind an additional 245,086 layoffs. More than 178,500 workers lost jobs because a company store, unit or department closed. Companies cited restructuring as the reason for another 128,255 layoffs. Artificial intelligence advances accounted for 54,700 job cuts, while tariffs were cited for nearly 8,000. President Trump's levies on trade partners have raised costs for companies, prompting some to trim spending elsewhere, including on labor. Small businesses, which operate on thin margins, say the tariffs have hit them especially hard. New data from payroll firm ADP shows that private-sector employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, driven largely by firms with fewer than 50 employees. These smaller employers have borne the brunt of rising costs and ongoing policy uncertainty. Edited by Aimee Picchi © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

If the next Tomb Raider game remains very mysterious, it could undergo major changes. Indeed, while some rumors suggest that it will be an open world, new information seems to announce a major turning point for the franchise, which could please or displease fans around the world. The last few months have been quite difficult for Crystal Dynamics. Many layoffs took place, which made fear the worst for the future of the franchise. But a series is still in development at Amazon Prime, and while this may seem insignificant, it could have repercussions for this game. Indeed, Story Kitchen recently revealed some information about these two projects, and the least we can say is that they will be connected. That's not all, because from a narrative point of view, the stories could be similar, and it's also possible to imagine that the series and the next Tomb Raider game will follow each other in some way. And if we remain in this hypothesis, the characters could resemble each other, which suggests that Sophie Turner could also embody the famous Lara Croft in the game. However, it is necessary to remain cautious, because these are just simple rumors. Moreover, Crystal Dynamics remains very discreet about this new project, even if we know that it will run on Unreal Engine 5. Therefore, we will have to wait for official information from the studio, which could be announced during The Game Awards 2025. Story Kitchen

Major U.S. equities indexes wavered between gains and losses Thursday afternoon, as tech stocks climbed but consumer staples stocks lost ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1% lower in recent trading, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ticked up 0.1%. Dollar General (DG) led gains on the S&P 500, with its stock up close to 12% after the discount retailer became the latest to post solid quarterly results, after a strong report from rival Dollar Tree (DLTR) yesterday. Meta Platforms (META) shares also surged, with shares jumping 4% following a Bloomberg report the Facebook and Instagram parent is looking to slash spending on its metaverse segment next year. Kroger (KR) was the largest decliner in the S&P 500. Its shares fell 6% after the grocery giant reported quarterly sales that missed analysts' expectations. Snowflake (SNOW) shares tumbled 11% after the cloud data analytics company issued a disappointing margin forecast, raising some worries on Wall Street about the company's AI-related investments. Intel's (INTC) stock sank 6%, giving up most of its gains earlier in the week. Reuters reported the embattled chipmaker, which has explored selling parts of its business to improve its finances, plans to keep its networking and communications segment after a strategic review. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 4.10%. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro and yen, while gaining on the pound. The price of Bitcoin slipped to trade just above $92,000 and Ethereum gained, while most other major cryptocurrencies lost ground.

Title: Dream11 pivots to sports entertainment, targets watch party experiences
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/dream11-pivots-to-sports-entertainment-targets-watch-party-experiences-11764853115545.html
Time Published: 2025-12-04T16:35:40Z

Hit by the real-money gaming ban, Dream11 has changed its strategy to become a sports entertainment platform. The company, with more than 250 million registered users on its platform, expects to capture a significant portion of the ‘watch party’ experience, or people watching streaming content, which India is likely to see explode in the sports segment, the founders told the media at an event. “We feel there is huge potential to build a ‘Twitch’ kind of global platform out of India in the sports segment,” Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Dream11 and Dream Sports, said. In 2014, Twitch, a streaming platform, was picked up by Amazon for $970 million in an all-cash deal. According to Jain, the total addressable market (TAM), a metric used by startups to understand the growth potential of a segment, is estimated to be $10 billion in terms of revenue. Globally, there are more than a billion sports enthusiasts that can be targeted, he said. Calling it a proven playbook, Jain said the company is spreading its bets and trying to bring something that adds value to the ecosystem. The app will allow users over the age of 18 to watch and interact with their favourite influencers during a live match. While the usage of the platform is free for all, Dream11 plans to monetise the experience through in-built ads, paid shoutouts, interaction with influencers, and an ad-free version, Jain said. According to him, the platform has been built with the aim of creating richer and more immersive sports experiences to complement live sports broadcasts. It will initially target smaller sums, such as ₹3-10 per user per shout-out or engagement. A large portion of this revenue will be allocated to the influencers, while the company will retain a small platform fee, Jain explained. The 2025 ban on real-money online gaming had a severe impact on Dream11's business, resulting in a nearly 95% loss in revenue overnight and forcing the company to shut down its paid contests. In response, Dream11 said it would focus on a free-to-play, ad-supported model. The company has also since entered the fintech business with Dream Money, which will offer a wealth management service targeting a new generation of investors. Mint reported the company’s intent to enter the broking business on 28 October. The company, backed by marquee investors such as Tencent, Steadview Capital, Tiger Global, TPG, ChrysCapital, TCV, and Alpha Wave Global, among others, was last valued at $8 billion. The company, which generated around ₹6,384 crore in revenues and ₹188 crore in profits as on 31 March 2023, has suffered a significant decline in revenues following the ban. “We have repurposed our employee base of 1,000 people to some of the emerging businesses we have under the group. While Dream Sports will have 200 people, the remaining 800 have been reallocated to other businesses,” Jain added. The parent has businesses such as Dream Sports AI, Dream Set Go, Dream Cricket, Dream Money, and Dream Sports Foundation, among others. “A business is built on retention and not just adoption. Both retention of users and employees is equally important,” Jain said. The company stated that it is allowing employees to walk out without penalty for breaching their contracts and has assured that there will be no layoffs in the engineering team. “We will cut costs on operating expenses, such as shifting to a cheaper office, but we do not plan to reduce the engineering team,” Jain added. Founded by Jain and Bhavit Seth, Dream Sports is not looking to raise any follow-on capital and will fund this pivot from internal accruals. As for the other businesses under the group, they will have their own independent growth trajectories and explore fund raises as needed, Jain said. “We want each business to run independently, and hence if there is a need to externalise them and raise capital, it will be done,” he added.

Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in more than three years last week, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates. The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 29 fell to 191,000 from the previous week’s 218,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s the lowest level since September 24, 2022, when claims came in at 189,000. Analysts surveyed by the data provider FactSet had forecast initial claims of 221,000. READ MORE: The economy is giving mixed signals. Here’s what experts say they mean Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. The job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low, but has left those out of work struggling to find a new job. On Wednesday, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report may be discouraging for people looking for jobs, but it bolstered expectations that the Fed will cut its main interest rate next week. It’s not clear how much weight this week’s layoff figures will carry with the Fed as the numbers can be volatile and prone to revisions. Complicating the Fed’s upcoming decision is inflation, which remains above the central bank’s 2% target. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation will be released in a government report on Friday and will also be factored into its rate call. Two weeks ago, the government said that hiring picked up a bit in September, when employers added 119,000 new jobs. That mixed report, which also showed employers had shed jobs in August, was delayed due to the government shutdown. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years, as more Americans returned to the labor market in search of work though they did not all immediately find jobs. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until later this month, after the Fed’s meeting, also due to the government shutdown. The government also recently reported that retail sales slowed in September after three months of healthy increases. Consumer confidence has plunged to its second-lowest level in five years, while wholesale inflation eased a bit. The data suggests that both the economy and inflation are slowing, which has boosted financial markets’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce its key interest rate at its meeting next week. If the Fed does reduce its benchmark rate next week, it would be the third cut of the year as it attempts to support a job market that has been slowing for months. Thursday’s report from Labor also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 9,500 to 214,750. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 22 dipped by 4,000 to 1.94 million, the government said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: Decoding brand sentiments: Leveraging customer reviews for insightful brand perception analysis using natural language processing and Tableau

Traditional survey-based feedback has given way to real-time online reviews, yet transforming this unstructured text into actionable knowledge remains difficult. Focusing on the highly competitive smartphone market, where customer sentiment shapes brand perception and product strategy, this study proposes an end-to-end analytics pipeline that combines Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), topic modelling, and interactive visualisation. Reviews for ten smartphone brands from Amazon (n ≈ 68 k) were pre-processed and class-imbalanced data were mitigated through class weighting. Sentiment classification was performed with ML models (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes) and DL models (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)). CNN achieved the highest accuracy 85.07% and balanced performance across positive and negative classes, although all models struggled with neutral reviews. Underlying themes were extracted with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF); quantitative evaluation using the Coherence Score (CS) showed that NMF produced more interpretable topics (CS = 0.54) than LDA (CS = 0.41). Topic-level sentiment was assessed with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER), linking features such as battery life and camera quality to positive or negative customer attitudes. Results are delivered through an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows practitioners to track sentiment trends, drill into coherent topics, and compare brand performance. The study also discusses ethical considerations, such as potential bias from imbalanced or culturally nuanced language, and outlines future work on cross-domain generalisation and fairness auditing. Overall, the integrated pipeline demonstrates that coupling CNN-based sentiment analysis with high-coherence NMF topics provides richer, business-ready insights than sentiment analysis alone.

Before the advent of the Internet, people typically visited physical stores to purchase products. Businesses could only provide feedback forms to customers for them to fill out to provide feedback on their products or customer experiences. The traditional manual feedback collection methods were often time-consuming for customers as they required filling out lengthy questionnaires and some customers might hesitate to complete the forms due to inconvenience. Hence, the data collected was limited for businesses to analyse and gain insights into customer opinions and preferences. The rise of online e-commerce platforms has transformed this landscape. Customers can now leave reviews at any time, making feedback collection faster and more efficient. Businesses can access these reviews in real-time, allowing for quicker responses and more informed decision-making. The Internet has increased the volume and significance of customer reviews, turning them into a crucial resource. A study by Forrester found that over 30% of Internet users have shared their opinions on products online. Consumers are more likely to trust the feedback from other customer rather than relying on company advertisements [1]. Consumers gradually trust the experiences of other buyers over advertisements, which has shifted the focus of businesses toward analysing online reviews to improve customer satisfaction and product offerings. In the rapidly growing smartphone market, brands like Samsung and Apple dominate, and e-commerce platforms like Amazon play a critical role in shaping consumer behaviour. Online reviews for smartphones have become important tools for both businesses and consumers, providing not only numerical ratings but also detailed feedback that helps buyers make informed purchasing decisions. The smartphone industry, with its constant innovation and competition, presents a unique opportunity to explore how sentiment analysis can help brands understand customer perceptions and stay competitive. Despite the abundance of online reviews, extracting actionable insights from large datasets remains a challenge. Traditional sorting methods, such as filtering by ratings, fail to capture the nuances in customer sentiment. Sentiment analysis, powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), addresses this by categorizing reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. While sentiment analysis has been applied across industries, limited research exists on its application within the smartphone sector. Existing studies often lack integration with topic detection and fail to utilize interactive dashboards for deeper insights. This study bridges this gap by addressing the research question: By incorporating these techniques, this research aims to offer a holistic approach to analysing customer feedback, aiding businesses in improving brand perception and competitive positioning. The objective of this research is to explore the growing importance of customer reviews in the smartphone industry. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyse Amazon customer reviews, this study aims to address gaps in existing research. Amazon’s extensive consumer feedback makes it an ideal dataset for this research. Through text mining, sentiment analysis, and topic detection, this study seeks to: This research will deepen the understanding of how customer reviews shape brand perception and provide businesses with practical tools to enhance their brand image in a competitive market. This study introduces a novel end-to-end pipeline that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) sentiment classification with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic detection and deploys the joint results in an interactive Tableau dashboard. Earlier work either relied on separate sentiment or topic models or required resource-intensive Large Language Models (LLMs), leaving practitioners without a single, interpretable workflow for real-time brand monitoring. By unifying CNN, NMF, and dashboard visualisation, our approach links polarity scores to specific discussion themes at scale and presents them in an operationally ready format. Beyond this technical novelty, we analyse customer reviews for ten leading smartphone brands, applying multiple ML algorithms to benchmark performance and demonstrate that our lightweight CNN-NMF pipeline achieves competitive accuracy while remaining resource efficient. The resulting interactive dashboards provide businesses with practical tools to track sentiment-topic trends, diagnose emerging issues, and tailor strategic responses. Consequently, the study advances academic understanding of integrated sentiment-topic modelling and delivers actionable guidance for industry stakeholders seeking to enhance brand reputation, customer loyalty, and product development. The structure of this research is as follows: Section 1 introduces the research topic, detailing its background, objectives, and contribution. Section 2 reviews relevant literature, summarizing key findings and identifying gaps in current knowledge. Section 3 outlines the research methodology, describing the methods and techniques employed in the study. Section 4 presents the results and discussion, including a detailed analysis and interpretation of the data. Section 5 concludes with recommendations based on the research findings. The remaining sections include the references list and appendix with supplementary materials. Online customer reviews are closely linked to brand perception, as they directly influence how consumers view a company’s products and services. This perception develops through multiple channels such as traditional advertising, word-of-mouth recommendations, and customer service experiences. However, the influence of digital platforms has become increasingly prominent. Online reviews, social media interactions, and digital marketing campaigns now play a key role in shaping consumer perceptions to make brand management more complex. According to [2] study, brand perception is considered a multi-dimensional construct, containing experimental, symbolic, emotional, and cognitive dimensions. This framework views brand perception through several lenses: the experimental dimension, which relates to direct interactions and experiences with the brand; the symbolic dimension, which relates to the brand’s image and associations; the emotional dimension, reflecting the feelings and emotional responses caused by the brand; and the cognitive dimension, which involves the intellectual evaluation and beliefs about the brand. Each of these dimensions contributes to how consumers form and adjust their perceptions of a brand. Building on Keller’s framework [2], Christodoulides [3] further categorize brand perception into three critical types: brand experience, brand affect, and brand trust. Brand experience focuses on the experiential interactions consumers have with the brand, brand affect captures the emotional responses towards it, and brand trust deals with the cognitive sense of reliability and safety when engaging with the brand. These dimensions are essential for understanding consumer behaviour, especially in the context of online apparel purchases where brand perception is continually shaped by digital interactions. For instance, a brand that good in delivering positive direct experiences and consistently communicates a strong image is more likely to foster positive emotional responses and be perceived as trustworthy and dependable. These dimensions are interrelated and often reinforce one another. In today’s digital landscape, the accessibility of online reviews allows companies to respond promptly to customer concerns and preferences, thereby strengthening customer relationships and building brand loyalty. A study by Vanani [4] found that brand communities on social networks, where customers share experiences and viewpoints, play a crucial role in shaping brand perception. Positive customer reviews can significantly enhance a brand’s reputation by amplifying favourable opinions and attract new customers. These reviews can help to build trust, reinforce brand identity, and contribute to long-term brand loyalty and success. By analysing a broad range of tweets, this study also showed that there is a significant correlation between customer support interactions and brand perception, indicating that good customer service can influence future company reputation, customer loyalty, and churn rates. Rapid and effective responses to customer inquiries and issues can lead to the improvement of customer sentiments about the brand. Customer reviews have become an essential component of brand perception as they provide insights into consumer experiences and sentiments, significantly influencing how a brand is perceived in the market. In the past, customer reviews were primarily collected through surveys or questionnaires, which provided limited data. For instance, a study [5] conducted a survey for H&M brands to analyse how social media can be used for branding purposes in Norway. The study found that client engagement with the brand was much higher on social media than through traditional methods, suggesting that brands should focus more on their social media presence. The authors also noted that the 28 questions in the questionnaire were not sufficient to cover the research subject comprehensively. In contrast, today’s digital landscape offers more dynamic ways to collect customer reviews through social media, e-commerce platforms, and public data sources. This modern approach allows businesses to quickly adapt to consumer needs and refine their market strategies. Analysing customer opinions is crucial for companies’ global growth, as feedback serves as a valuable tool for evaluating reviews and addressing criticisms effectively [6]. Social media platforms like Twitter have become useful resources for sentiment analysis, with tools like Tweepy, a Twitter streaming API, enabling the collection of tweets on specific topics [7]. For example, research [8] used Tweepy to gather 99,850 tweets mentioning “Nike” and “Adidas” across various dates in 2018 as part of a comparative study to gauge public opinion on these leading international apparel brands. Their research revealed that most customers rely on online product reviews before making a purchase, highlighting the growing importance of public customer reviews as a vital resource for businesses aiming to improve product design and offerings. Positive reviews and high ratings significantly influence potential buyers and enhance a brand’s reputation. Further highlighting the significance of customer sentiment reflected in reviews, study [9] conducted an aspect-based sentiment analysis on a dataset of various car brands obtained from the Kaggle website. Their findings demonstrated that a higher sentiment score is linked with an increased likelihood of consumers choosing that brand, particularly in the competitive automotive industry. These insights are helpful for brand managers and stakeholders, who can use them to sustain brand reputation and profitability by proactively addressing consumer concerns related to product reliability. They found that Lamborghini achieved the highest sentiment score among the car brands analysed, reflecting strong customer satisfaction, particularly in areas such as comfort and price justification. This illustrates how a higher sentiment score can significantly boost customer preference, with Lamborghini owners expressing satisfaction with the quality and value of their vehicles. This case highlights the critical role that positive sentiment plays in enhancing a brand’s reputation and influencing consumer choices. Sentiment analysis is the process of extracting and interpreting textual data to understand its emotional content through text mining and processing techniques. NLP techniques are used in sentiment analysis to categorise sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. This powerful tool is widely used across diverse industries such as marketing, finance, healthcare, and politics to analyse public opinion, improve product development, and support strategic decision-making. Another research [10] utilised NLP techniques to examine game reviews and categorise them into positive or negative sentiments. NLP offers several benefits in game studies, such as automated review analysis and the identification of gameplay patterns that can help improve game design. However, NLP techniques also face challenges, including difficulty in capturing language nuances such as sarcasm and irony, potential inaccuracies with context-specific language, limited generalisation of diverse player perspectives, and dependence on domain expertise for accurate interpretation. Moreover, techniques for sentiment analysis range from lexicon-based methods to advanced ML and Deep Learning (DL) models. Lexicon-based approaches, like those used by [11] and [12] in social media sentiment analysis, assign predefined sentiment scores to words or phrases. The opinion lexicon-based method, where a lexicon consisting of positive and negative opinion words is used to evaluate sentiment in sentences as positive, negative, or neutral. This widely used method involves applying a scoring function to each sentence, based on the presence of these opinion words. These methods are simple and computationally efficient but often lack the contextual understanding needed for accurate sentiment interpretation. For example, sarcasm, irony, or idiomatic expressions can easily lead to misinterpretation because the lexicon-based approach does not account for context beyond the predefined sentiment scores. Despite these drawbacks, lexicon-based methods continue to be widely used, especially in scenarios where speed is prioritized over depth of analysis. They serve as a foundational tool in sentiment analysis, often combine with more advanced techniques to enhance accuracy. As data grow in complexity, ML-based sentiment analysis models, such as Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM), offer powerful tools for analysing social media data, as demonstrated by [13–15]. These models can adapt to new data and capturing complex sentiment patterns. However, they necessitate large, labelled datasets and substantial computational resources. Their findings revealed that SVM achieved the highest predictive accuracy after cross-validation, outperforming the other models in most cases. This underscores the general observation that SVMs often deliver better performance compared to other classification models. With the increasing volume of data, traditional classification models often face efficiency challenges, making DL models particularly advantageous for sentiment analysis. These models, such as CNN, Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), offer benefits like automatic feature extraction, faster computation with accelerated hardware, and robust performance with large datasets [16,17]. Studies show that LSTM outperforms CNN and Simple RNN due to its ability to retain word sequences and capture long-range dependencies, which are crucial for accurate sentiment analysis. While overfitting was initially a challenge, it was addressed by optimizing parameters. Another research [18] also found that LSTM outperformed lexicon-based methods for calculating brand sentiment, though its high resource demands limited analysis to shorter timeframes. In recent years, the use of LLMs like BERT, GPT, and Llama has become increasingly common in sentiment analysis. Study [19] demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs over traditional transformers in identifying depressive content in Bengali social media posts, yielding good outcomes. These models, which are trained on huge amounts of text, are capable of understanding and human-like language with high accuracy. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), introduced by Google in 2018, was one of the first LLMs to make a significant impact in this area. Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), known for powering tools like ChatGPT, has also gained widespread recognition. Llama2, a more recent model from Meta, builds on the foundational transformer architecture with some enhancements. A study by Kwon [20] explored the use of these models for sentiment classification, comparing their performance with traditional and DL models. The study found that BERT and GPT outperformed others, achieving an F1-score above 0.9. However, the research also highlighted challenges associated with these LLMs. For instance, training these models, required considerable computational time and resources [21]. Llama, despite being a powerful model, showed lower accuracy in this study and demanded significant resources in terms of memory and training time. Additionally, further fine-tuning Llama proved to be time-consuming, making it less practical compared to the more efficient BERT and GPT models. Beyond sentiment analysis, topic detection plays a crucial role in interpreting large volumes of customer feedback, particularly from platforms like Twitter, where texts are often brief and incorporate slang. As short-text analysis gains prominence, [22] and [23]proposed two widely used methods: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and NMF for clustering these texts into coherent topics. Their findings suggest that while both models are effective, NMF generally outperforms LDA, offering more distinct topic classifications in short-text analysis. Furthermore, [24] conducted a systematic review of the airline industry, applying sentiment analysis and topic modelling to demonstrate their practical utility in various industries. Integrating these techniques enables a deeper understanding of consumer feedback, proving invaluable for businesses seeking actionable insights. Brand sentiment analysis focuses on evaluating consumer perceptions of a brand, informing marketing strategies, product development, and brand management. As customer feedback volume increases, sentiment classification has become a significant research area, helping businesses leverage customer opinions for better decision-making. This analysis predicts customer attitudes towards brand products and services and provides insights into consumer behaviour by systematically examining feedback to understand brand perception. Another research [13] emphasize sentiment analysis as a crucial tool for understanding customer sentiment, allowing businesses to strategically target advertisements based on positive reviews. A study [12] demonstrated the efficiency of sentiment analysis over traditional surveys by using Twitter data to create visual representations that can help businesses in understanding customer opinions. The study [25] underscore the importance of sentiment analysis in extracting actionable insights from reviews, although challenges such as sarcasm and nuanced language can affect accuracy. The process of gathering and labelling data for ML can be time-consuming, especially with large datasets [26,27]. Correlating sentiment analysis with customer ratings helps reveal how reviews impact overall satisfaction and supports data-driven decision-making. Another research [28] used sentiment analysis at the document, sentence, and aspect levels to categorise Amazon mobile phone reviews, capturing overall sentiment, specific preferences, and detailed product features. Nevertheless, the study encountered limitations, such as the reliance on the Afinn lexicon, which may yield different results with other tools, and the manual extraction of main product features, which could vary with different methods. The research also emphasised the need for validation with other corpora and the inclusion of n-gram features and qualifiers. In contexts like Twitter, where specific sentiment labels may be missing, Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) are an effective tool for assessing sentiment. Specifically designed for social media, VADER able to measure both the polarity and intensity of emotions, considering language tones and even emojis. Pai [29] highlighted its ability to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on sentiment scores, making it particularly useful for short-text analysis. Mishra [9] applied VADER in the automotive industry, finding that higher sentiment scores were linked to increased brand preference. These insights are valuable for brand managers to enhance reputation and address consumer concerns. VADER is easy to implement and does not require extensive training data, making it accessible for both researchers and businesses looking to perform sentiment analysis without needing complex ML models. Prior investigations typically addressed sentiment analysis and topic modelling in isolation or required resource‑intensive LLMs that limit practical deployment. Few works link polarity, topic context, and decision‑support visualisation in a unified workflow. By integrating a lightweight CNN for sentiment classification with Non‑Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic extraction and presenting the joint results in an interactive Tableau dashboard, our study overcomes those fragmentation and scalability challenges. This end‑to‑end pipeline demonstrates that near‑state‑of‑the‑art accuracy, granular topic insights, and real‑time business intelligence can coexist without the computational overhead of LLMs. Consequently, the proposed method advances the state of the art by delivering an interpretable, resource‑efficient, and operationally ready framework that directly maps consumer narratives to actionable brand strategies. This study utilized a comprehensive dataset of Amazon reviews, obtained through Kaggle [30]for its accessibility and relevance. This dataset was selected due to its easier accessibility compared to data from social media platforms, which require payment. Additionally, Amazon is one of the world’s largest online retailers, making its review data highly comprehensive. The Amazon customer review dataset consists of two CSV files: ‘items’ and ‘reviews’. The ‘items’ CSV file provides summarised information such as Product ASIN, Product Brand, Product Name, Product URL, Product Image URL, Product Avg. Rating, Product Review Page URL, Product Total Reviews, Product Price ($), and Product Original Price ($). The ‘reviews’ CSV file contains detailed customer reviews including Product ASIN, Reviewer Name, Reviewer Rating (on a scale of 1–5), Review Date, Valid Customer Indicator, Review Title, Review Content, and Helpful Feedback. This dataset encompasses 67,987 Amazon customer reviews across ten different smartphone brands: ASUS, Apple, Google, HUAWEI, Motorola, Nokia, OnePlus, Samsung, Sony, and Xiaomi, ranging from November 24, 2003, to December 25, 2019. Moreover, the reviews in the dataset are accompanied by ratings ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 denotes the lowest rating and 5 signifies the highest. There is detailed content associated with each rating as well as information on the product and brand name. Overall, the dataset includes a total of 714 products across ten brands, making it a good source for conducting detailed sentiment analysis. Data processing involved refining the dataset by removing null values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns (e.g., URLs). The ‘items’ and ‘reviews’ files were merged using an inner join on the product “ASIN” attribute, resulting in a consolidated dataset named “Amazon_phone_review.csv”. Reviews were categorized using an automated Python-based heuristic labelling strategy: ratings of 1–2 were labelled as “Negative” 3 as “Neutral” and 4–5 as “Positive” as shown in Fig 1. This process resulted in a streamlined dataset of over 60,000 labelled reviews prepared for sentiment analysis. During model training, class weights were applied to mitigate the effects of class imbalance and ensure that underrepresented sentiment categories contributed proportionally to the loss function. This approach improved classification fairness without modifying the original data distribution. To implement this strategy, class weights were computed from the training set using the compute_class_weight function in the scikit-learn library. The resulting weight vector [Negative = 1.39, Neutral = 4.89, Positive = 0.50] reflects the inverse frequency of each sentiment class in the data. For traditional ML algorithms, these weights were supplied through the class_weight parameter (where supported) to ensure the loss function penalised mistakes on minority classes more heavily. For DL models, the same weights were passed to the fit method in Keras, thereby scaling the categorical cross-entropy loss during training. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g001 To provide an overview of the dataset, multiple visualisations were generated using Python. First, Fig 2 reveals that the Samsung brand received the highest number of reviews, whereas the ASUS brand received the fewest. Apple, Nokia, and Xiaomi received a similar count of reviews. According to this distribution, there is a significant difference in customer engagement among brands, with Samsung dominating in terms of customer feedback volume. Next, Fig 3 shows that the average rating for all brands exceeds 3.5, with Nokia having the lowest average rating at around 3.3. While most brands have generally received positive reviews from their customers, Nokia’s products are likely to receive more critical reviews than other brands. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g002 The red dashed line indicates the overall mean rating across all brands, serving as a benchmark for comparative evaluation. The red dashed line indicates the overall mean rating across all brands, serving as a benchmark for comparative evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g003 Fig 4 presents the distribution of reviews over time by brand from 2003 to 2020. Initially, from 2003 to 2008, reviews were exclusively for Motorola mobile phones. This could be due to Motorola’s early entry into the market or its popularity during that period. Subsequently, reviews began to appear for other brands, and the number of reviews steadily increased over the years. This reflects the growing diversity and competition in the smartphone market. Notably, Samsung received the most reviews overall, indicating its popularity over the years. On the other hand, in the case of the Xiaomi brand, reviews only began to appear after 2018. This late entry into the review dataset indicates that Xiaomi’s market presence significantly increased around this period. The number of reviews has continually increased since then, peaking in 2020. This trend highlights Xiaomi’s rapid growth and rising consumer interest in recent years. The detailed analysis of these visualisations provides valuable insights into customer behaviour and market trends over time, which can be crucial for strategic decision-making. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g004 Fig 5 displays the sentiment distribution of Amazon smartphone reviews. The dataset comprises 68.51 percent positive, 24.50 percent negative, and 6.99 percent neutral reviews based on the labelled ratings. To enhance statistical robustness, 95 percent confidence intervals were computed for each sentiment category using the normal approximation method for binomial proportions, from a total of over 60,000 reviews. The resulting estimates are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g005 To explore brand-specific sentiment differences, data from the most recent complete year, 2019, were analysed, as all ten brands were represented with sufficient review counts. As summarised in Table 2, Xiaomi, HUAWEI, and OnePlus received the highest proportions of positive reviews above 80%, reflecting strong consumer satisfaction. In contrast, Nokia showed the highest proportion of negative reviews 36.69%, indicating comparatively lower customer satisfaction. Samsung maintained a strong positive sentiment 71.50% consistent with its market leadership, whereas Apple exhibited a higher share of negative reviews 26.95%, possibly reflecting heightened user expectations. These differences demonstrate how brand reputation and product performance are reflected in sentiment patterns within the same market year. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t002 However, other sources of imbalance such as the uneven temporal and brand distribution of reviews were not explicitly addressed. For example, some brands only appear in later years (e.g., Xiaomi), which may influence the model’s ability to generalize across brands and time periods. Future work could explore temporal resampling or brand-stratified evaluation to better account for these biases. Raw text data usually contains noise or irrelevant information that can impact the accuracy and effectiveness of sentiment analysis. An effective text data preprocessing is crucial for preparing raw text data for sentiment analysis. This process involves several key steps, including cleaning the data, lemmatizing with POS (part-of-speech) tagging, removing stop words, and tokenizing text. Each of these steps plays a vital role in transforming the raw data into a format that can be effectively analysed by ML algorithms. Firstly, text cleaning is performed by removing punctuation, special characters, and numbers. This step is important because cleaning the text helps reduce noise, making the core content more accessible and analysable. Removing irrelevant information allows the model to focus on the significant features of the text, leading to better performance in sentiment analysis. Additionally, the text is standardised by converting all characters to lowercase. For instance, “BUY” or “Buy” is converted to “buy.” Without this step, words that are the same could be treated differently by text processing algorithms simply due to case differences, thereby reducing the accuracy of results. This standardisation helps create a uniform dataset, which is crucial for accurate analysis. To further refine the dataset, the contractions in the text data is also expanded; for example, “don’t” is converted to “do not.” This ensures that words are not counted separately, thus maintaining consistency. After that, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)‘s predefined stop-words list is used to remove common stop words like “a,” “the,” and “is.” This enhances model performance by highlighting important words that carry the meaning of the text. In the last step of our text preprocessing, lemmatization with POS tagging is applied by using WordNet Lemmatizer from NLTK. POS tagging involves assigning a specific label such as noun, verb, adjective, etc, to each word in the sentence. This labelling is essential because it provides contextual information that helps in accurate lemmatization. Lemmatization helps to reduce words to their base form and standardise text data. For instance, the word “purchasing” is reduced to its base form “purchase.” By applying the lemmatization process, the text data was further cleaned and standardized, reducing words to their root forms while preserving their essential meanings. This comprehensive preprocessing ensures our dataset is well-prepared for subsequent sentiment analysis shown in Fig 6 and Fig 7. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g007 Following these preprocessing steps, the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method is employed for feature extraction. TF-IDF is calculated using the formula [15], which is illustrated in Equation 1: The TF-IDF scheme is particularly effective at emphasizing terms that frequently appear in each document. Term frequency (TF) quantifies the frequency of a term’s occurrence within a specific document. The TF-IDF method combines (Term Frequency) TF with the inverse document frequency (IDF) to highlight the significance of a term within a document relative to the entire dataset. The pre-processed text data is then converted into numerical features that can be used for ML models. The TfidfVectorizer not only computes the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) values but also manages tokenization internally. These preprocessing and feature extraction techniques are essential for transforming raw text data into a format that enhances the effectiveness of subsequent analysis. Finally, the pre-processed text data was combined with essential attributes, such as “brand,” “rating,” and “sentiment,” for subsequent sentiment analysis. To prepare the data for model training and prediction with traditional classification models, data splitting was performed using the train_test_split function. This step divided the pre-processed dataset into training and testing subsets to ensure that the ML models could be effectively trained and evaluated. Specifically, 80% of the data was allocated to the training set, while 20% was reserved for the testing set. The testing set serves as a separate subset to evaluate the model’s performance and generalizability on unseen data. This split is crucial for assessing how well the model performs. On the other hand, DL models often work directly with raw or minimally processed data. Sentiment labels were converted into numerical format and then one-hot encoded using LabelEncoder. Texts were tokenized with the Tokenizer, configured to manage up to 10,000 words and out-of-vocabulary tokens. The tokenized sequences were then padded to a uniform length of 100 tokens. Subsequently, train_test_split was used again to divide the data into 80% of training and 20% of testing subsets. This ensured that both types of models received appropriately formatted and split datasets for effective training and evaluation. To ensure fair and systematic optimisation across models, a grid-search procedure was applied to both traditional ML and DL algorithms. For Decision Trees, the grid included max_depth ∈ {200, 400, 600, 800, 900}. Naïve Bayes was tuned with alpha ∈ {1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05}. Logistic Regression explored C ∈ {0.1, 1.0, 10}, solver ∈ {lbfgs, saga, sag}, and max_iter ∈ {100, 200, 300}. The SVM grid covered C ∈ {1, 5, 10}, kernel ∈ {linear, rbf}, and gamma ∈ {scale, auto}. For DL models, the CNN grid comprised kernel_size ∈ {3, 5, 7}, filters ∈ {64, 128}, and dropout_rate ∈ {0.2, 0.5}; training epochs were capped at 20 with Early Stopping patience of 3. The RNN and LSTM grids varied units ∈ {64, 100}, dropout ∈ {0.2, 0.3}, and learning_rate ∈ {0.001, 0.0005}. All grids were evaluated with five-fold cross-validation on the training set, and the best hyperparameter combination for each algorithm was selected according to mean validation accuracy. These chosen settings form the basis of the fine-tuning results reported in Section 4. The selection of traditional ML models for this study was guided by their established performance and interpretability in text classification and sentiment analysis tasks. Tree-based model such as Decision Trees was included because of their ability to handle nonlinear relationships, mixed feature types, and feature importance estimation. Naive Bayes models were chosen for their probabilistic foundation and efficiency in high-dimensional text data, particularly where word independence assumptions hold approximately true. Logistic Regression models were selected for their robustness, ease of interpretation, and effectiveness as strong linear baselines in sentiment prediction problems. SVM models were included due to their proven capability to generalise well in sparse feature spaces and to achieve strong discriminative boundaries in text-based classification. The models were assessed based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall. Neutral sentiments may be underrepresented in the dataset compared to positive and negative reviews. This imbalance can lead the model to focus more on the majority classes and perform poorly on the minority class. If the features of neutral reviews are not distinct enough, the model may struggle to classify them accurately. Other ML were not considered in order to maintain methodological focus and computational efficiency, as the primary aim was to benchmark the performance of diverse learning paradigms (probabilistic, linear, and non-linear) against advanced DL models. The selected models therefore represent a balanced mix of interpretability, generalisability, and computational practicality, making them well-suited to the sentiment classification objectives of this study. 3.7.1.1 Decision Trees: Decision Trees model has a tree-like structure, where each node represents a decision or test on an attribute, branches indicate the possible outcomes of these decisions, and leaf nodes signify the final predictions. In the context of classifying customer reviews, a hierarchy of decision nodes is built based on review features to categorise the reviews into different sentiment categories. In the context of our dataset, entropy is a key concept used to measure the uncertainty or randomness in the data, specifically in how the data is classified into different sentiment categories. The formula of splitting criterion – Entropy from [31] is shown below in Equation 2. where S is the dataset that entropy is calculated, c is the sentiment classes in set S, and p(c) – the proportion of elements belonging to class c in the dataset S. 3.7.1.2 Naive Bayes Model: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic approach for text classification that operates under the assumption that documents are created by a distribution determined by unseen parameters. The model estimates these parameters from the training data and uses Bayes’ theorem to calculate the likelihood of each class. It classifies documents by selecting the class with the highest probability. Naive Bayes model would first calculate the probability of the class [31], which is illustrated as in Equation 3: Here c represents data belonging to a particular sentiment class, x is the data with an unknown class, P(c|x) represents the posterior probability of the class given the predictor, P(x|c) is the predictor probability of the given class, P(c) – prior probability of the class, P(x) is the prior probability of the predictor. 3.7.1.3 Logistic Regression Model: Logistic Regression is a supervised learning technique that predicts the probability of a target variable by modelling the likelihood of a data point belonging to a specific class [32]. This model utilizes the logistic function, which maps input values to a probability range between 0 and 1, allowing it to classify data into discrete categories. The formula of Logistic Regression model [33] is illustrated as in Equation 4: where S(x) represents logistic function or sigmoid function, p refers to the probability of the dependent variable belonging to a particular class, e is the exponential function, and x means linear combination of the input features. This method is applicable in both binary and multiclass classification scenarios. According to the dataset used for this study, this model will estimate whether a review belongs to a positive, negative, or neutral category, and assigns it to the most likely category. In this study, Logistic Regression was implemented using a multinomial (SoftMax) formulation to accommodate the three sentiment categories (positive, negative, and neutral). The model was trained using the LogisticRegression class in scikit-learn with the parameter setting multi_class = ‘multinomial’ and the solver lbfgs. This approach estimates a separate set of coefficients for each sentiment class relative to a common baseline and computes class probabilities through the SoftMax function. The predicted sentiment label is then assigned based on the class with the highest probability. This configuration ensures that the model captures the full range of sentiment categories within a unified probabilistic framework, providing interpretable and generalisable classification outputs. 3.7.1.4 Support Vector Machine Model: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a powerful supervised ML algorithm that is widely used in classification tasks. This model operates by identifying the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes within a multidimensional space. The goal of the SVC is not just to find any hyperplane but to discover the one that maximizes the margin between classes, ensuring that the separation is as clear and distinct as possible [34,35]. The SVM model formula [14] is presented as follows in Equation 5: where W represents the weight of vector perpendicular to the hyperplane, X is the feature vector of a data point, and b is the bias term that adjusts the hyperplane from the origin. The margin is the distance between hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. The larger the margin, the better the model performance [32]. This combination of mathematical precision and strategic placement of the hyperplane makes SVC a highly effective tool in the realm of ML, particularly for tasks involving complex and high-dimensional data. 3.7.1.5 Training Procedure for Machine Learning Models: To ensure consistent evaluation across all ML classifiers, a standardized training procedure was adopted. Each model, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM was implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python (version 1.2.2). Prior to training, the dataset was split into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing subsets using stratified sampling, as described in Section 3.5. Feature vectors were extracted using TF-IDF vectorization, preserving token frequency information critical for classification. Hyperparameters for each model were optimized through grid search with five-fold cross-validation, using validation accuracy as the scoring metric. For Decision Trees, the maximum depth was varied in the range of 200–900; Logistic Regression was optimized across different solvers (lbfgs, saga, sag) and regularization strengths (C = 0.1 to 10); SVM tuning involved kernel choice (linear, RBF), penalty parameter (C = 1–10), and gamma settings. Naive Bayes used smoothing values (alpha) between 0.05 and 1.0. Class weights were adjusted in all models where applicable to handle the sentiment imbalance described in Section 3.2. All models were trained and tested under the same random seed (42) to enable reproducibility. Final model performance was reported based on the test set using metrics described in Section 3.7.3. In addition to the traditional ML models, DL models were also explored in this study to provide a broader comparison. These models known for their ability to capture complex patterns in data were included to assess whether they could outperform traditional models. In this study, deep neural network models including CNN, RNN and long-short term memory (LSTM) classifiers were employed. 3.7.2.1 Convolutional Neural Network: CNN are powerful feedforward neural networks commonly applied in fields like image classification or object recognition. CNN have recently been adapted for text classification with impressive results due to their ability to automatically learn and extract meaningful features from raw data. A simple architecture of CNN is shown as Fig 8 below. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g008 CNN consists of embedding layer, convolutional layer, pooling layer, flatten and dense layer. The process begins with an embedding layer, which converts raw text into numerical representations since ML and DL algorithms cannot process raw text directly. The convolutional layer identifies high-level features through a convolution operation by sliding the filters over the input sequence. After this, the pooling layer reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps to decrease computational complexity and highlight the most relevant features [16]. Sometimes, the flatten layer is used to convert the feature maps into a single column vector, making them suitable for input into the dense layer. The dense layer is then employed to determine the class label, utilizing SoftMax activation functions for tasks involving multi-class classification. In this study, this model begins with an embedding layer that is added to convert word indices into dense vectors of fixed size and followed by a Conv1D layer with 128 filters and a kernel size of 5. ReLU activation function is then applied to capture local features from the text. Next, a MaxPooling1D layer with a pool size of 2 is used to retain the most important features. A Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 is included to prevent overfitting. Following this, a GlobalMaxPooling1D layer further down-samples the input representation by taking the maximum value across the entire dimension to reduce the computation while retaining crucial features. The model then includes a Dense layer with 128 units and a ReLU activation function for additional processing, followed by another Dropout layer to further mitigate overfitting. The final layer is a Dense layer with 3 units, corresponding to the three sentiment classes, and a SoftMax activation function to output a probability distribution over the classes. The model is compiled using the categorical cross-entropy loss function, which is appropriate for multi-class classification problems, and the Adam optimizer, known for its efficiency and adaptive learning capabilities. The CNN was trained for 20 epochs using a batch size of 32. These parameters were selected through preliminary experiments involving a manual grid search approach. The kernel size of 5 was chosen based on its ability to capture short-range dependencies in review text, offering a balance between local pattern extraction and computational efficiency. Early experimentation showed that kernel sizes smaller than 5 underperformed in validation accuracy, while larger sizes increased training time without measurable gains. Similarly, the choice of 20 epochs was based on early stopping criteria and validation curve trends. The model exhibited peak performance around Epoch 15 and began showing signs of overfitting beyond that point. Training beyond 20 epochs offered minimal additional benefit while increasing the risk of overfitting and computational cost. These observations guided the final hyperparameter configuration, which is further discussed in the Results and Discussion sections. 3.7.2.2 Recurrent Neural Network: A RNN is a specialized form of artificial neural network designed to process sequential data, making it particularly effective for tasks such as language translation, NLP, and speech recognition [17]. RNN have a unique ability to retain information from previous inputs, which allows them to influence current and future outputs, enhancing their learning capability from training data [16] The formula for RNN model is shown as in Equation 6: where b is bias value, is the previous hidden state, which carries information from past time steps and is current input, which determines its influence on the current hidden state. This can be seen as a process where the RNN updates its memory (hidden state) at each time step by combining information from the previous hidden state and the current input, passing this combination through a non-linear activation function (tanh). This allows the network to process sequences of data in a way that invovle both the current input and the history of past inputs. The RNN model shown in Fig 9 in this study is designed with an Embedding layer, followed by a SpatialDropout1D layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 to reduce overfitting. A single LSTM layer with 100 units is used with both dropout and recurrent dropout rates of 0.2 to further prevent overfitting. Adding LSTM layer in a model helps capture more complex patterns and relationships in the data. The model also includes a Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation to capture complex features, and a final Dense layer with SoftMax activation for three-class sentiment classification. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g009 3.7.2.3 Long Short-Term Memory: LSTM is a specialized form of RNN designed to capture and learn long-term dependencies in data [20]. The architecture of LSTM is outlined in Fig 10. In LSTM model, the pre-processed input data is represented as an embedding matrix. The LSTM layers with number of units will process the data, followed by fully connected layer for classification task. The final layer will use an activation function to reduce the dimensional input vector down to a single output. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g010 Moreover, Fig 11 shows the mechanism of LSTM model. LSTM consists of a memory cell (ct) and three key non-linear gates: the input gate (it), the forget gate (ft) and the output gate (ot). The memory cells maintain a consistent state over time, while the gates control the flow of information into and out of the cell to ensure that relevant data is retained or discarded as needed. These mechanisms allow LSTMs to effectively retain relevant data over time. In short, LSTM networks employ a memory cell along with a set of gates to manage the storage, updating, and retrieval of information across extended sequences. These mechanisms allow LSTMs to effectively retain relevant data over time [17]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g011 In this study, the LSTM model was constructed starting with an Embedding layer, followed by a SpatialDropout1D layer, like the architecture used in the CNN and RNN models. This model consists of three LSTM layers, each with 100 units and dropout settings of 0.3 for both standard dropout and recurrent dropout. These layers enable the model to learn complex temporal relationships within the data. After the LSTM layers, there is a Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation for additional feature processing. To avoid overfitting, a Dropout layer with a 0.5 rate is included. The final output is a Dense layer with 3 units and a SoftMax activation, suited for multi-class sentiment classification. Additionally, Reduce Learning Rate On Plateau (ReduceLROnPlateau) is used to lower the learning rate of the model when validation accuracy has stopped improving. 3.7.2.4 Training Procedure for Deep Learning Models: All DL experiments followed a unified training protocol to support reproducibility. For every network, the dataset was shuffled and stratified into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing splits as described in Section 3.5. Models were built with the Keras implementation in TensorFlow 2.14 and trained on a single NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU. The Adam optimizer was used with an initial learning_rate of 0.001 for the CNN and RNN, and 0.0005 for the LSTM network, reflecting the grid selections in Section 3.6. The batch_size was fixed at 32 across models for comparability. Early Stopping monitored validation loss with patience = 3 and restored the best performing weights. A ReduceLROnPlateau callback halved the learning rate if validation accuracy plateaued for two epochs. Each model was permitted a maximum of 20 epochs, although Early Stopping typically halted training earlier (CNN at epoch 7, RNN at epoch 9, LSTM at epoch 16). Training history, including loss and accuracy per epoch, was logged and the final weights were saved with a version tag corresponding to the best validation epoch. The same random seed (42) was set for NumPy and TensorFlow to ensure repeatability of results. To compare the effectiveness of various models, multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed. By analysing these metrics, strengths and weaknesses across different models can be identified, allowing for the selection of the most effective model for the task. Each metric offers insights into how well the models classify data. where P refers to precision, TP is the True Positive, which the instances where the model correctly identifies the positive class, and FP is False Positive which the instances where the model incorrectly predicts a positive class. where, FN is False Negative. The instances where the model fails to identify a positive class and incorrectly predicts it as negative. During evaluation, cross validation was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the models. Cross validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by evaluating its ability to make accurate predictions on new data [14]. The models were cross validated 5 times to ensure robust evaluation in this study. All model evaluations, including those during hyperparameter tuning and final testing, were conducted using five-fold cross-validation with stratified sampling to preserve class distribution across folds. Random shuffling of the dataset was performed before splitting to ensure robustness and reduce ordering bias. The same random seed (42) was used across all experiments to support reproducibility. To determine the topics in this dataset, two topics modelling are used in this section. Topic modelling can also be used for a variety of tasks such as detecting trends on social media or uncovering hidden themes in large text datasets. In this study, three topic detection models including LDA, and NMF are used to reveal insights from the dataset. LDA model is a generative probabilistic model that assumes K latent topics are hidden in given N documents corpus. This method is particularly useful in revealing the thematic structure of the dataset and allows for a nuanced understanding of the dominant topics present in the customer reviews. The generative process for each document in the text archive is presented as Fig 12 below. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g012 This process outlines how each document is generated in the entire corpus. Each document in the corpus is assumed to be a mix of these topics, and the words within the document are drawn from this mixture. The generative process is repeated for each document, leading to a probability model for the entire corpus. The model’s hidden variables, which represent the topic-word distributions (ϕ) and document-topic distributions (θ), are estimated using techniques like Gibbs sampling and variational algorithms by maximizing the probability P(D∣α, β) of the observed data given the model parameters. The formula of probability [22] is shown in Equation 11: The equation represents the likelihood of observing the entire corpus 𝐷, given the model's hyperparameters 𝛼 and 𝛽. The probability is denoted as 𝑃 (𝐷∣𝛼, 𝛽), where 𝛼 controls the distribution of topics within documents (document-topic distribution) and 𝛽 controls the distribution of words within topics (topic-word distribution). indicates that the likelihood is calculated as a product over all documents in the corpus (where 𝑁 is the total number of documents). The function 𝐹 (𝜃, 𝜙) represents the probability of observing all the words in document given the topic distribution and the topic-word distributions. In short, the process involves summing over all topic assignments for each word in each document and then multiplying these probabilities across all words and documents. The LDA model was constructed to uncover the five main topics within customer reviews across various brands. The text data was pre-processed and converted into a bag-of-words format. Using this corpus, an LDA model was constructed with a predefined number of topics, K as five topics. The model assumes that each review is a mixture of these topics, with each topic represented as a distribution over words. The final topics, represented by the top words within each topic, provide insights into the main themes filtered by each brand in customer reviews. NMF is a technique used to simplify complex data by breaking it down into non-negative components. NMF helps uncover hidden topics within the document by expressing each document as a combination of a few key themes. For each document, NMF represents it as a sum of these components, with specific weights showing how much each component contributes to that document. The process of NMF finding the best combination of components is done by minimizing the difference between the original data and the reconstructed version based on these components. The goal is to approximate the original matrix 𝐷 (which contains the data) as the product of two non-negative matrices, U and V. This is represented by the equation [22] below in Equation 12: where D is the original data matrix, U represents the topics, V shows how these components mix to recreate the original data and ∥ ⋅ ∥ F denotes the Frobenius norm, which measures the difference between the original and approximated matrices. Moreover, the formulas for U and V [22] are shown as below in Equation 13 and equation 14: These equations adjust U and V to minimize the difference between the original data and its approximation. The optimization process can be done by adjusting U to better fit the data D based on how well the current V represents D or adjusting V to better fit the data D based on how well the current U represents D. In this study, an NMF model was built to uncover five topics by brand. The process began by transforming the text data into a numerical format using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization. This method captures the importance of words in each document while considering their frequency across the entire corpus. The top ten words associated with each topic were then extracted to provide insights into the primary themes present in the reviews. To evaluate the quality of topics generated by the LDA and NMF models, we calculated the Coherence Score (CS) using the c_v metric. The CS measures the degree of semantic similarity between the most relevant words within a topic, thereby reflecting its interpretability. A higher CS suggests that the top words in a topic are more meaningfully related and thus more easily understood by humans. This metric is widely used in topic modelling evaluations to provide a quantitative assessment of how coherent or useful the generated topics are. In this study, CS values were computed using the gensim library in Python. After identifying the topics, the VADER sentiment analyser was applied to assess the sentiment associated with each brand. VADER is well known at analysing the sentiment of texts, including those with emojis and other social media-specific elements that other libraries might overlook. VADER provides four different sentiment scores: positive, negative, neutral, and compound. The positive, negative, and neutral scores represent the proportion of the text that falls into each category, while the compound score is a combined metric that sums up the overall sentiment of the text. This compound score ranges from −1 (indicating extremely negative sentiment) to 1 (indicating very positive sentiment) [4]. In this study, only the compound score is used to assess sentiment. By linking the sentiment scores to the topics generated by the topic detection model, the average sentiment for each topic across all reviews was calculated. This approach provided us with insights into not only the key themes present in the customer feedback but also the overall sentiment associated with each theme. For example, a topic related to phone camera feature might have a positive sentiment, while another topic related to product quality might be neutral. The results were categorized into sentiment types, Positive, Neutral, and Negative, based on the average sentiment scores, allowing for a clear understanding of how customers feel about various aspects of the brands they reviewed. Brand sentiment analysis is crucial for businesses to understand how customers perceive their products and services. By evaluating sentiments, companies can gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and tailor their marketing strategies effectively. Overall, this model shown in Fig 13 allowed us to effectively combine topic modelling and sentiment analysis to gain a deeper understanding of customer opinions for each brand. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g013 In this section, the results from both traditional ML models and DL techniques are examined. The outcomes of each model are presented, with their performances compared to determine the most effective approach for the dataset. Additionally, the results of the brand topic detection model are explored, and each method is evaluated to identify the most suitable model. Finally, the VADER sentiment analysis tool is applied to assess the sentiment scores associated with the identified topics. As detailed in Table 3, the Decision Trees model achieved an average accuracy of 77.29% after running five cross-validation. It performs particularly well on the majority class, which is positive sentiments, with an average precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.87. In contrast, its performance on negative sentiments is less robust, with average metrics of 0.66. This indicates that the model is better at identifying and classifying positive reviews compared to negative ones. For neutral sentiments, the model struggles to recognize them, achieving only an F1-score of 0.20. The tree’s depth of 937 suggests that the model is quite complex, involving multiple decision nodes to classify the data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t003 To improve the performance of the Decision Trees model, fine-tuning was conducted by adjusting the key parameter, max_depth, to explore different values. Max Depth refers to the maximum number of splits allowed in a Decision Trees and determines how deep the tree can grow, with each level representing a decision based on a feature in the dataset. During fine-tuning, it was observed that the model’s performance did not improve significantly as demonstrated in Table 4 and Table 5. After running cross-validation for each max_depth value, a maximum depth of 600 yielded an average accuracy of 77.31%. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t005 The Naive Bayes model is known for its high speed and efficiency in text classification tasks. As shown in Table 6, it achieved an average accuracy of 78.01%, which is comparable to the Decision Trees model’s performance. The Naive Bayes model outperforms the Decision Trees model in terms of recall for positive sentiments, achieving a high recall rate of 0.99. This means that Naive Bayes is highly effective at identifying positive reviews. However, its precision is lower than that of the Decision Trees model, standing at 0.78. This indicates that while Naive Bayes is particularly good at detecting positive sentiments, it is less accurate in ensuring that all detected positive reviews are genuinely positive. Conversely, the Naive Bayes model struggles significantly with neutral sentiments, scoring zero across all evaluation metrics for this category. This suggests that the model fails to identify or predict neutral reviews, which might be attributed to factors such as dataset imbalance, insufficient representation of neutral sentiments, or the model’s inability to distinguish neutral reviews effectively. On the other hand, the model performs well with negative sentiments, showing a high precision of 0.88, meaning it correctly identifies negative reviews 88% of the time. Nonetheless, its recall for negative sentiments is only 0.47, indicating that it captures just 47% of all actual negative reviews. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t006 To further enhance the performance of the Naive Bayes model, fine-tuning was performed by adjusting the key parameter, alpha. In Naive Bayes models, alpha is a smoothing parameter used to handle zero probabilities in the estimation of probabilities for unseen words in the training data. After fine-tuning, the model’s accuracy improved to 82.69%, outperforming the previous version with a smaller alpha value of 0.05. With a smaller alpha, the model is less likely to assume that all words occur with a uniform probability. As a result, the recall for negative sentiments improved significantly from 0.47 to 0.71, indicating a better ability to correctly identify negative reviews. Additionally, the F1 score for neutral sentiments also saw a slight improvement, reflecting some progress in predicting neutral reviews. Table 7 presents the results of the Naive Bayes model after fine-tuning. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t007 For classification tasks, logistic regression is a supervised ML algorithm designed to predict the likelihood that a given instance belongs to a specific class. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 85.05%, making it the best-performing model so far. Based on Table 8, it performs very well on positive sentiments, with f1-score of 0.92, and 0.78 on negative sentiments. Nonetheless, the model struggles with neutral sentiments, achieving only 26% precision, 2% recall, and a 4% F1-score. This low performance could be due to the limited number of neutral sentiment instances, meaning the model may not have enough examples to learn from. Additionally, logistic regression might be better at distinguishing between obvious different classes (positive vs. negative) and struggle with the minor distinctions required for neutral sentiments. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t008 To improve the performance of the logistic regression model, fine-tuning was conducted by adjusting several parameters. Specifically, a range of values for the regularization strength parameter C was explored, which governs the trade-off between achieving a good fit on the training data and maintaining smaller model coefficients. Additionally, different solvers (sag, lbfgs, and saga) were assessed to determine the optimization algorithm used, and various settings for the max_iter parameter were examined, which specifies the maximum number of iterations allowed for the solver to converge. Although these adjustments were made, the enhanced logistic regression model did not improve significantly with accuracy of 85.07% as shown in Table 9. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t009 Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised ML algorithm that works by finding the optimal boundary that best separates different classes. Table 10 and Table 11 present the detailed results of the SVM model, including its performance after fine-tuning. The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 85.02%, which is comparable to the logistic regression model. Like the logistic regression model, the SVM performs well in classifying positive sentiments, with an impressive F1-score of 0.92, and negative sentiments, with an F1-score of 0.78. The model also struggles with neutral sentiments, showing only 33% precision and 2% recall. This indicates the model correctly identifies only 2% of all actual neutral reviews, and one-third of the predictions it makes for neutral reviews are accurate. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t010 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t011 To further enhance the performance of the SVM model, we fine-tuned it by adjusting the regularization parameter C and setting the kernel to ‘linear’. Specifically, we increased the regularization parameter (C) to 10 to evaluate its effect on model performance. A higher C value in SVM typically signifies a greater emphasis on minimizing classification errors on the training set, potentially leading to improved model accuracy. Despite these adjustments, the tuned SVM model yielded an accuracy of 83.27%, which is slightly lower than the previous version. However, the larger C model shows a slight improvement in neutral sentiment detection, but overall performance remains low. In summary, while increasing C slightly improves the detection of neutral sentiments, it results in a decrease in overall accuracy, suggesting a potential overfitting to the training data. A CNN was employed to perform sentiment analysis and achieved an accuracy of 85.07%. The CNN model was initially set to train for 20 epochs but stopped early at the 7th epoch due to the Early Stopping criterion. Early Stopping was configured with a patience of 3 epochs, meaning the training would halt if no improvement in validation loss was observed for three consecutive epochs. The relatively small number of trainable parameters in the CNN architecture and the structured nature of the dataset contributed to rapid convergence. By the final epoch, the training accuracy reached 93.13%, while the validation accuracy had peaked earlier at 85.72% during the second epoch, indicating potential overfitting. Although the number of epochs completed was low, this was driven by clear validation trends suggesting that further training would not yield improved generalization. To enhance the performance, the fine-tuned CNN model included additional layers compared to the initial model. Firstly, a SpatialDropout1D layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 was added after the embedding layer to reduce overfitting. Then, two Conv1D layers were included: the first with 128 filters and the second with 64 filters, both with a kernel size of 5 and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation. Each Conv1D layer was followed by a MaxPooling1D layer and a Dropout layer with a 0.5 dropout rate to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the fine-tuned model included an extra Dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation, followed by another Dropout layer, before the final Dense layer with 128 units and the output layer. These modifications aimed to enhance the model’s ability to capture complex patterns in the data and improve generalization. Fig 14 suggests that during the initial epochs, training accuracy steadily increases while training loss decreases, demonstrating effective learning. However, starting from Epoch 2, the validation loss begins to rise, and validation accuracy starts to decline, indicating overfitting. This trend suggests that the model becomes increasingly specialized to the training data and loses generalization capability on the validation set. Compared to the previous model, the fine-tuned CNN model achieved a slightly lower accuracy of 84.51%. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g014 When evaluated on the test set, the RNN model achieved an accuracy of 84.56%, which is comparable to the CNN model. While the RNN showed improvement in accuracy over epochs during training, the trends displayed in Fig 15 reveal signs of early instability and eventual overfitting. From Epochs 0–3, both training and validation accuracy fluctuate noticeably, suggesting that the model struggled to generalize consistently during the early stages of training. A significant gain in performance is observed from Epoch 4 onward, culminating in peak validation accuracy around Epochs 6 and 7. However, validation accuracy begins to decline slightly after Epoch 8, even as training accuracy continues to rise, indicating that the model starts to overfit to the training data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g015 To further improve the model, an enhanced RNN configuration was implemented by introducing an additional LSTM layer with 100 units. This LSTM layer was paired with dropout and recurrent dropout rates of 0.3 to reduce overfitting. The additional layer helped capture more complex sequential dependencies in the input text. This was followed by a Dense layer with 128 units and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation to extract additional features, and a final Dense layer with SoftMax activation for three-class sentiment classification. As shown in the training plots, training and validation loss both decline steadily up to Epoch 6. After this point, training loss continues to drop, while validation loss begins to plateau and slightly increase from Epoch 8 onward. Similarly, training accuracy steadily increases across all epochs, but validation accuracy peaks around Epochs 7–8 and shows a slight decline afterward. These trends clearly indicate that while the model initially generalizes well, overfitting begins to emerge in the later epochs. The enhanced RNN model achieved a slightly improved accuracy of 85.01% on the test set, reflecting marginal but consistent gains over the baseline. The graphs indicate early instability followed by convergence and later-stage overfitting, as shown by the divergence between training and validation metrics after Epoch 8. The performance instability observed in the RNN model, particularly during the early and late training epochs, may be attributed to suboptimal hyperparameter settings or the model’s architectural complexity relative to the dataset. Although dropout techniques were employed to mitigate overfitting, the model’s generalization capacity appeared limited after a certain point in training. Further optimization, such as adjusting learning rates, increasing data volume, or exploring simplified architectures, may enhance performance stability in future work. To further improve the model, an enhanced RNN model was designed by adding an additional LSTM layer with 100 units. This layer is paired with dropout and recurrent dropout rates of 0.3 to help prevent overfitting. The addition of the extra LSTM layer allows the model to further capture more complex patterns and relationships within the data. Following the LSTM layers, the model includes a Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation to extract further features, and a final Dense layer with SoftMax activation for three-class sentiment classification. Initially, the model shows steady improvements, with both accuracy and loss trending positively as shown in Fig 16. Nevertheless, from Epochs 1–3, there is some fluctuation in the validation metrics, indicating instability in the learning process. A notable improvement occurs after Epoch 4, where validation accuracy increases significantly. Yet, after Epoch 9, the validation metrics begin to decline slightly, suggesting potential overfitting as the model continues to improve on the training set but shows less progress on the validation set. This indicates that the model’s generalization capacity may be nearing its limit, with the best performance observed around Epoch 8. The model achieved an accuracy of 85.01% on the test set, showing only a slight improvement over the previous RNN model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g016 The initial LSTM model’s training performance shows an improvement over epochs, though with some fluctuations. According to Fig 17, the model’s accuracy gradually increases as the loss decreases from Epoch 1 to Epoch 4, reflecting a positive learning curve. A significant improvement occurs around Epoch 5, where the model’s accuracy increases, especially in validation accuracy, which increase from 70% to 85%. This trend continues as the model reaches its peak performance in Epoch 7, where the validation accuracy stabilizes around 85.97%. Conversely, in subsequent epochs, the model’s performance starts to drop, with minor increases in accuracy and slight increases in validation loss, indicating potential overfitting. The final accuracy achieved on the test set is 85.04%, which suggests the model is may have limited further improvement beyond this point. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g017 The enhanced LSTM model uses a slightly reduced learning rate (0.0005), which appears to stabilize the learning process more effectively. Validation accuracy and loss metrics demonstrate a more consistent improvement across epochs as presented in Fig 18. The validation accuracy continues to improve up to Epoch 16 before showing signs of minor fluctuations, while the first model started showing signs of overfitting by Epoch 9. Both models ultimately achieve similar final test accuracies of 85%. Yet, the second model achieves this through a more stable learning process, suggesting potentially better generalization to unseen data, even though the improvement in accuracy is minimal. In summary, the enhanced LSTM model shows improvements in training stability, overfitting control, and consistent performance across epochs. Although both models achieve similar final accuracies, the second model’s training process suggests a better-tuned model with improved learning dynamics. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g018 To compare the performance of various models on a sentiment classification task, the overall accuracy of each model is provided in Table 12 below. These accuracy scores provide a straightforward measure of how well each model performs in correctly classifying sentiment across a large dataset. Following the accuracy comparison, Table 13 and Table 14 offer a more granular analysis by presenting key performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and support for each sentiment class (negative, neutral, and positive). These tables provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, not just in terms of overall accuracy, but in their ability to manage the nuances of sentiment classification across various categories. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t012 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t014 When examining the accuracy scores, the Logistic Regression and CNN models achieved the highest overall accuracy at 85.07%, slightly outperforming LSTM (85.05%), and SVM (85.02%). Although the differences in accuracy are relatively small, these results indicate that even slight variations in model architecture or algorithm choice can impact performance in sentiment analysis tasks. The comparative performance of traditional classification models, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM across different sentiment classes highlights significant differences in effectiveness. For negative sentiments, both Logistic Regression and SVM demonstrate impressive performance, each achieving an F1 Score of 0.78. The Decision Trees model, however, shows more modest performance with an F1 Score of 0.66. Regarding neutral sentiments, the Decision Trees model performs best among the models with an F1 Score of 0.20, but this reflects a limitation in capturing neutral sentiments effectively, as it recalls only 17% of these cases. The other models perform even worse, particularly in terms of recall, with values falling below 0.05. This underscores the difficulty all models face in accurately classifying neutral sentiments. In summary, Logistic Regression and SVM are particularly effective for classifying both positive and negative sentiments, while they struggle with neutral sentiments. The Decision Trees model performs slightly better on neutral sentiments compared to others but is still limited. The overall effectiveness of Logistic Regression and SVM makes them more robust for handling sentiment classification, although the underrepresentation of neutral sentiments in the training data likely contributes to the models’ struggles with accurately identifying and classifying these less frequent cases. The evaluation of DL models including CNN, RNN, and LSTM models reveals performance characteristics across the sentiment categories of negative, neutral, and positive. For negative sentiment classification, all models exhibit good performance, with an average F1 Score of 0.77. For positive sentiment classification, all three models perform strongly. The CNN model achieves an F1 Score of 0.92, with high precision of 0.90 and recall of 0.94. The RNN model follows closely with an F1 Score of 0.91, precision of 0.89, and recall of 0.94. The LSTM model also performs well, reaching an F1 Score of 0.92 with a precision of 0.88 and recall of 0.96. In contrast, classifying neutral sentiments remains challenging for all models. Each model reports extremely low scores across precision, recall, and F1 Score for this category. The CNN model shows a slightly better performance with a precision of 0.41 and recall of 0.02, but these figures remain notably low. The RNN model performs worse with a precision of 0.30 and recall of 0.01, while the LSTM model struggles significantly, with all metrics at zero. This poor performance in identifying neutral sentiments is likely due to the imbalanced representation of neutral sentiments in the dataset, which provides insufficient context for the models to learn and generalize effectively. Based on the provided results, the CNN and LSTM Model are the best models due to their strong performance across positive and negative sentiments. Logistic Regression has the highest accuracy but is not the best in all sentiment-specific metrics compared to CNN and LSTM. For neutral sentiment classification, all models are faced with challenges. If overall accuracy and balanced performance across sentiment categories are prioritized, the CNN Model might be preferred due to high F1 Scores in both positive and negative sentiments. The LSTM Model is also a strong candidate as it able to capture positive sentiment with high recall. To evaluate whether the observed accuracy differences are statistically meaningful, a paired t-test was applied to the five-fold cross-validation accuracies of the CNN against each baseline model. Table 15 reports the resulting p-values (df = 4). A threshold of 0.05 was used to determine significance. The CNN outperforms Decision Trees and Naïve Bayes with statistically significant margins, while its advantage over Logistic Regression, SVM, RNN, and LSTM is not significant at the 0.05 level. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t015 These results support the descriptive metrics in Table 12: although CNN shares similar mean accuracy with Logistic Regression and LSTM, its superiority is statistically confirmed only over the lower-performing traditional models. Consequently, conclusions about model ranking should emphasise practical as well as statistical considerations. After classification, the identification of main subjects within the Amazon customer review dataset is facilitated through the utilization of two topic detection algorithms: LDA and NMF. The purpose of this is to reveal the main topics people are talking about in the Amazon customer review dataset. The LDA model was employed to discover five primary topics for each brand within the Amazon customer reviews dataset. These topics are characterised by a distribution of words that summarise the key themes prevalent in the reviews. The main points include: By detecting these topics across different brands, the LDA model provides valuable insights into the aspects of phone performance that matter most to consumers. The topic explanations for each brand can be found in Table 1–10 of Appendix A in S1 File. After that, the NMF model was also employed to discover five primary topics for each brand within the Amazon customer reviews dataset. The key points identified by NMF model include: This explanation highlights that the NMF model captured not only performance-related aspects but also emotional themes. The topic explanations for each brand can be found in Tables 11–20 of Appendix B in S1 File. To provide an objective assessment of topic quality, we calculated the CS using the widely adopted c_v metric. Higher CS values indicate greater semantic similarity among the top words in a topic, resulting in more interpretable themes. The LDA model achieved a CS of 0.41, whereas the NMF model obtained a higher CS of 0.54. These quantitative results corroborate the qualitative findings in Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2, confirming that the NMF topics are more coherent and therefore better suited for analysing brand perception in this dataset. In evaluating the performance of these two topic-detection approaches, the NMF model emerges as the most effective for this study. NMF produces more focused, detailed, and interpretable topics, making it the strongest tool for understanding brand perceptions within customer reviews. The LDA model tends to capture topics that are closely related to phone features yet often overlapping. Themes such as “battery” and “camera” frequently intersect with broader topics like overall user satisfaction, limiting LDA’s ability to separate distinct aspects of user experience, especially in the smartphone domain, where multiple features influence perception simultaneously. By contrast, the NMF model delivers more precise and distinguishable topics. It not only identifies general themes like user satisfaction but also uncovers specific issues such as product condition upon arrival or mixed feedback on certain models (e.g., Asus Zenfone). NMF further highlights detailed topics such as camera performance and connectivity issues, each treated as a distinct subject with its own sentiment profile. This granularity enables deeper analysis of how customers perceive individual phone features. When NMF reveals, for instance, that camera performance is a significant concern for a brand, product development and marketing teams can address that issue directly. The clarity and specificity of NMF topics thus provide actionable insights, facilitating improved brand management and customer satisfaction. In conclusion, NMF proves to be the most effective topic-modelling technique for this study. Its capacity to extract distinct, focused topics and capture a wide range of user sentiments and product attributes makes it the preferred choice for understanding and analysing brand perception in customer reviews. By leveraging NMF, business owners gain a deeper and more actionable understanding of how customers perceive different aspects of their products, enabling more targeted improvements and more effective communication with consumers. After selecting the best topic detection model, brand sentiments were generated by applying the VADER sentiment analysis on the results. Sentiment scores help categorize customer opinions into positive, neutral, or negative, and provide a clear measure of consumer sentiment. The sentiment scores for each brand can be found in Table 21 of Appendix C in S1 File. Here is a summary of the sentiment scores for various smartphone brands: Overall, these sentiment analyses provide a comprehensive view of customer perceptions, enabling brands to address concerns. This information also can guide strategic decisions, such as enhancing product features that are well-received, addressing common complaints, or refining marketing messages to align with customer expectations. Following the sentiment analysis and topic detection, which offered a deeper understanding of the underlying themes and sentiments within the dataset, we now shift our focus to visualizing the broader aspects of the data. Visualization is essential for uncovering patterns, trends, and insights. This section presents a series of visualizations that offer a comprehensive overview of the dataset, employing both Python and Tableau for this purpose. Several graphs were created using Python to provide a detailed analysis of the dataset. These Python-generated graphs offer an initial exploration of the data. The top ten products with the most customer reviews are presented in Fig 19, allowing business owners to identify which products were customer favourites during this timeframe. Most of these products are from the Samsung brand, with only one product each from Xiaomi and Nokia. By knowing the popular brand among the smartphone users, a business owner can determine if a particular feature or product brand resonates more with consumers, enabling them to focus on those aspects in future inventory management and marketing strategies. Besides, Fig 20 plots the top three products for each brand, providing insights into the best-selling products for each brand. This information can help business owners understand which products are most popular among customers for each specific brand. For instance, a business owner can manage product inventory more effectively by deciding whether to stock up on popular items, reduce stock for less favoured ones, or import similar products with popular features. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g019 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g020 Additionally, a comprehensive dashboard was created in Tableau to compile and extend these insights as seen in Fig 21. The Tableau dashboard includes visualizations such as reviews over time, average ratings by brand, total reviews by brand, sentiment distribution across categories for each brand, and a summary of the top ten products by brand in terms of review count and average rating. This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for gaining a comprehensive view of Amazon customer reviews across distinct brands, allowing for a deeper understanding of brand performance and customer perception. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g021 In conclusion, this study addressed the challenge of extracting actionable insights from the extensive volume of customer reviews, particularly within the smartphone industry. By applying sentiment analysis techniques, topic detection, and an interactive Tableau dashboard, this research filled a gap in the literature on brand sentiment analysis for smartphone brands. The results showed that the CNN model, which achieved the highest accuracy at 85.07%, provided balanced performance across sentiment categories and proved to be particularly effective for overall sentiment analysis. Although Logistic Regression achieved similar accuracy, it fell short in comparison to CNN across sentiment-specific metrics. All models struggled with classifying neutral sentiments, which may be attributed to the less emotionally charged nature of these reviews. While early stopping and dropout were applied to address overfitting in the CNN model, we acknowledge that the observed gap between training and validation accuracy suggests room for further improvement. Due to the scope of the current study, additional regularization techniques such as L2 weight decay, batch normalization, and text augmentation were not explored. These strategies are being investigated in ongoing follow-up work aimed at enhancing model generalization and robustness. All DL models were capped at 20 global epochs to maintain parity of training time across the benchmark. While early stopping indicated convergence in most cases, this cap may have curtailed the models’ ability to extract deeper feature hierarchies. Ongoing work is experimenting with extended epoch schedules, cosine learning-rate decay, and warm-up strategies to determine whether additional training yields measurable gains in generalisation. Building on these findings, the research made significant contributions. Firstly, the development of an interactive Tableau dashboard enables businesses to monitor customer sentiment trends and brand perception effectively. This tool provides businesses with a comprehensive visual analysis of customer feedback, helping them to make data-driven decisions that enhance brand image and customer satisfaction. Secondly, this study proposed a new framework that applies sentiment analysis, topic detection and brand topic sentiments. This approach provides a holistic view of customer feedback, which is essential for businesses in the competitive smartphone market. However, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The dataset used only includes information up to 2019, which may not reflect the most recent trends or shifts in language usage. Additionally, challenges in text preprocessing, such as handling multilingual content and slang, may have impacted model performance. Future research should consider using real-time social media analytics, if possible, to capture more up-to-date customer feedback. The dataset also revealed a clear imbalance in sentiment labels. This imbalance posed a risk of model bias during classification. To mitigate this, class weighting was applied during model training, ensuring that minority classes contributed more significantly to the loss function. Preliminary experiments showed that weighted training improved the recall of Negative and Neutral classes by three to five percentage points compared with an unweighted baseline. Techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), data augmentation, or ensemble re-weighting were not employed in this study; future work could explore these alternatives to determine whether they further mitigate imbalance without introducing noise. In this study, we adopted a conventional 80/20 random train-test split to benchmark model performance, which allowed for a balanced distribution across sentiment categories. However, we recognise that this approach may not fully capture the complexities of real-world generalisation. The observed similarity in model performance could, in part, stem from the homogeneity introduced by this split strategy. As such, we acknowledge the value of more challenging evaluation frameworks. Future work will explore brand-wise, temporally stratified, and cross-platform data splits to better evaluate model robustness and generalisability across diverse product lines and evolving consumer contexts. Other sources of imbalance, such as the uneven temporal and brand distribution of reviews, were also not explicitly addressed. For example, some brands only appear in later years (e.g., Xiaomi), which may influence the model’s ability to generalize across brands and time periods. Future work could explore temporal resampling or brand-stratified evaluation to better account for these biases. Reviews were categorized using an automated Python-based heuristic labelling strategy, which relied in part on the VADER lexicon-based approach. While this facilitated efficient labelling of over 60,000 reviews, it may oversimplify sentiment classification, particularly for neutral or ambiguous cases. Lexicon-driven methods such as VADER are constrained by their dependence on pre-defined word lists and heuristics, which can struggle to capture contextual nuances, sarcasm, or domain-specific terminology. These limitations introduce potential ambiguity in the dataset and may affect model training and evaluation outcomes. Future iterations of this study may therefore explore more robust labelling methods, such as manually annotated datasets, semi-supervised learning approaches, or transformer-based sentiment labelling techniques, to improve contextual sensitivity and reliability. Due to computational constraints, hyperparameter tuning for CNN, RNN, and LSTM models was limited to a focused grid of empirically selected values. While this ensured fair benchmarking, we acknowledge that a broader search might have yielded better-optimised configurations. Each model was tuned via five-fold cross-validation, with the best settings selected based on mean validation accuracy. In future work, we aim to adopt more systematic tuning methods, such as Bayesian or random search, to explore a wider range of architectural and optimisation parameters and further improve model robustness. While the current pipeline relies on conventional ML and foundational DL architectures, recent advances in NLP demonstrate that richer text representations can be obtained through Word Embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe, and through Transformer-based LLM such as BERT, Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), and GPT. These models capture context-dependent semantics, idiomatic expressions, and subtle sentiment cues that conventional bag-of-words and static embeddings may overlook. Future work will therefore integrate pre-trained contextual embeddings or fine-tuned transformer encoders into the sentiment-classification stage, benchmark their performance against the current CNN baseline, and evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, interpretability, and computational cost. While the present work focuses on Amazon smartphone reviews, we recognize that broader applicability requires careful consideration. The proposed pipeline is adaptable to other e-commerce platforms and consumer domains where reviews share structural similarities, such as hospitality, consumer electronics, and healthcare. However, differences in linguistic styles, platform-specific rating systems, and domain-specific terminology may limit direct transferability. To strengthen generalizability, future research should evaluate the framework across multiple datasets and platforms, potentially using domain adaptation or transfer learning techniques to account for variations in language and context. This would ensure that the approach remains robust and reliable when applied to diverse industries beyond the Amazon ecosystem. Beyond technical performance, this study also acknowledges the ethical implications of deploying automated sentiment analysis systems. Bias in training data, such as imbalanced sentiment classes, skewed brand representation, or culturally specific language, can propagate through the model and result in unfair or inaccurate predictions. For instance, reviews written in non-standard dialects or by speakers from diverse linguistic backgrounds may be misclassified due to underrepresentation in the training set. Automated sentiment classifiers may also inadvertently amplify stereotypes or marginalize minority voices if not properly audited. To ensure responsible AI practices, future work should incorporate fairness evaluation metrics, conduct bias audits, and explore mitigation techniques such as adversarial debiasing or fairness-aware training. Transparency, accountability, and inclusivity should be core principles in the development and deployment of sentiment analysis models used for real-world decision-making. In conclusion, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of customer sentiment analysis and provides practical tools for businesses to improve their brand perception and customer satisfaction in the highly competitive smartphone market. At the same time, the ethical implications and challenges of generalizability must not be overlooked. By embedding fairness, transparency, and adaptability into future work, sentiment analysis frameworks can achieve both technical robustness and responsible application across diverse domains.

By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in more than three years during Thanksgiving week, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates. The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 29 fell to 191,000 from the previous week’s 218,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s the lowest level since September 24, 2022, when claims came in at 189,000. Analysts surveyed by the data provider FactSet had forecast initial claims of 221,000. Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said that unemployment benefit filings are often distorted by the Thanksgiving holiday, which can cause some people who may have lost jobs to delay filing claims. Still, the low claims figure also suggests that overall layoffs remain muted, despite the high-profile announcements. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. “The labor market is kind of frozen,” Bostjancic said. “Companies are in wait-and-see mode.” Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. The job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low. On Wednesday, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report may be discouraging for people looking for jobs, but it bolstered expectations that the Fed will cut its main interest rate next week. It’s not clear how much weight this week’s layoff figures will carry with the Fed as the numbers can be volatile and prone to revisions. Complicating the Fed’s upcoming decision is inflation, which remains above the central bank’s 2% target. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation will be released in a government report on Friday and will also be factored into its rate call on Wednesday. Two weeks ago, the government said that hiring picked up a bit in September, when employers added 119,000 new jobs. That mixed report, which also showed employers had shed jobs in August, was delayed due to the government shutdown. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until later this month, after the Fed’s meeting, also due to the government shutdown. The government also recently reported that retail sales slowed in September after three months of healthy increases. Consumer confidence has plunged to its second-lowest level in five years, while wholesale inflation eased a bit. The data suggests that both the economy and inflation are slowing, which has boosted financial markets’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce its key interest rate at its meeting next week. If the Fed does reduce its benchmark rate next week, it would be the third cut of the year as it attempts to support a job market that has been slowing for months. Thursday’s report from Labor also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 9,500 to 214,750. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 22 dipped by 4,000 to 1.94 million, the government said.

December 04, 2025 05:14 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. NEW YORK, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (NASDAQ: WRD, HKEX: 0800), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, has attracted investment from ARK Invest (ARK), a leading investment firm managed by Cathie Wood. Based on its public disclosure, ARK acquired a total of 858,295 WeRide American Depositary Shares (ADSs) from public markets over the past three trading days, indicating confidence in the company's growth prospects and long-term strategic positioning in the autonomous mobility market. ARK’s investment aligns with its focus on disruptive innovation, as autonomous mobility is on track to become a multi-trillion-dollar global market, with robotaxi fleets potentially reaching tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, according to ARK's "Big Ideas 2025" report. WeRide is well positioned to capture this growth, with over 1,600 autonomous vehicles (AVs) internationally and presence in over 30 cities across 11 countries. WeRide is the only company whose AVs hold autonomous driving permits in eight countries – China, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, France, Belgium, and the US – highlighting strong regulatory trust in its technology. Earlier this week, Bank of America (BofA) initiated research coverage on WeRide at Buy with a price target of US$12 for its ADSs listed on NASDAQ and HK$31 for its Class A Ordinary Shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This represents an upside potential of 45.6% and 50.0% respectively, based on the November 28 closing prices of US$8.24 and HK$20.66. Other recent Buy ratings include Bank of China International (BOCI) (September 29, target price: US$20.00, 96% upside potential) and Citi (November 7, target price: US$15.30 and HK$39.601, 62% upside potential). Based on recent public filings, WeRide’s shareholders now include leading global institutions such as Bosch, Fidelity Management & Research, Greenwoods Asset Management, Hudson Bay Capital, Invesco, M&G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, NVIDIA, Temasek and multiple other long-only and sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, among others. Grab, Southeast Asia's leading superapp, and Uber, the world’s largest mobility and delivery technology platform, are also shareholders in WeRide. WeRide’s strong Q3 2025 performance reflects the confidence shown by ARK and other major shareholders. WeRide recorded revenue of US$24.0 million, up 144.3% year-on-year (YoY), with its core Robotaxi business delivering US$5.0 million in revenue, up 761.0% YoY. Gross profit grew 1,123.9%, while gross margin rose 26.4 percentage points to 32.9%, placing WeRide among industry leaders and underscoring its path toward profitability. Founder and CEO Dr. Tony Han noted in a recent CNBC interview: “I'm very optimistic with WeRide's leading position in the global market and our technology. Profitability is a sure thing." This success stems from WeRide's commitment to staying at the forefront of the fast-evolving autonomous mobility market. WeRide One, the company’s universal autonomous driving technology platform for L2 to L4 vehicles, integrates full-stack software algorithms, modular hardware solutions, and cloud-based infrastructure, enabling strong synergy across mobility, logistics and sanitation products on open roads. WeRide’s rapid global expansion has not gone unnoticed among investors, supported by its proven track record in navigating complex regulatory environments and in consistently being a first mover across international markets. Notably, the company obtained the world’s first city-level fully driverless Robotaxi commercial permit outside the United States in Abu Dhabi and has already launched the fully driverless service on the Uber platform, with the operation on track to achieve breakeven unit economics. Besides Abu Dhabi, WeRide's AVs are deployed in Guangzhou, Beijing, Singapore, Riyadh, Dubai, Leuven (Belgium), etc., and its Robotaxi secured a driverless permit in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. WeRide plans to deploy 500-1,000 Robotaxis in the Middle East by end-2026, and tens of thousands worldwide by 2030. WeRide has achieved fully driverless Robotaxi operations in Guangzhou, Beijing and Abu Dhabi, and in Abu Dhabi, the WeRide-Uber Robotaxi service covers about half of Abu Dhabi core areas. BOCI analysts recently noted that "WeRide is poised to stand out as one of the final winners" as the global robotaxi industry scales. Reflecting this positive outlook, ARK’s stake in WeRide, alongside a strong shareholder base and Buy ratings from BOCI, BofA, CICC, Citi, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS and other leading investment banks, demonstrates confidence that WeRide’s strategic execution and growing commercial footprint will drive long-term shareholder value. About WeRideWeRide is a global leader and a first mover in the autonomous driving industry, as well as the first publicly traded Robotaxi company.

Kevin Rose: Tim-Tim, another episode of The Random Show. Glad to be back. Tim Ferriss: Another episode of The Random Show. Kevin Rose: This is awesome. Tim Ferriss: You look very dashing. For people who can’t see you, you have hair slicked back, jacket with wide open lapels, reminiscent of a leather jacket. You look like a leading man from The Outsiders, that movie back in the day. You just need a cigarette in your pocket and some other goodies, but you’re looking good, looking good. You also have, as you disclosed to me, your secret weapon nearby an IKEA light that is providing very seductive shadows and contours on your face. So, well done. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think we’re both hacking it together today. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, today has been putting together the boxcar on the way down the hill in a sense, from an equipment standpoint, but here we are. Kevin Rose: Here we are. Tim Ferriss: We made it. Now, you asked me to grab a glass of wine, which I didn’t do. I ended up grabbing a glass of Gin, Caledonia Spirits Barr Hill gin. For anybody who’s curious, I do like my gin, B-A-R-R Hill. But this might surprise people and it surprised me because last time we spoke, I think you had hit, what was it, six months or however long it was. Six months sober. So what is unfolding before our very eyes? Kevin Rose: Well, what’s unfolding is a glass of champagne is what’s unfolding, but I’ll say that I almost made it to seven months, but then I just decided — my original goal was three months, and then I made it to six, and was I going to continue to go on like this? And I had hung out with some friends. We had a dinner in San Francisco, and I thought, “You know, I’m going to have a glass of vino. I’m just going to have a glass of wine because I don’t want to make this…” It was actually, there was a great book. You know the book Awareness, which you’ve recommended to me. Tim Ferriss: It’s one of my favorites. I have one of my many copies downstairs right now. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: Yeah. So, Anthony de Mello, Jesuit priest. Correct? Is that right? Tim Ferriss: Jesuit priest, who is also a psychotherapist who is now since passed, but incredibly, incredibly compelling writing. I’m sure we’ll get more into this because I listened to the audiobook you recommended, so we’ll come back to that. Kevin Rose: Oh, cool. Awesome. Tim Ferriss: But all right, so take us back to the story you’re telling. So, you’re sitting there — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Well, prior to that, I had re-listened to that book and I got it on audio. And one of the things that hit me that he said in the book was — Tim Ferriss: I know what it was. Can I guess? Kevin Rose: Yeah, you do. Yeah, go for it. Tim Ferriss: That abstinence or asceticism. Renunciation is as much a trap, or can be as much a trap as anything else because it ties you, it binds you to the thing that you are from. Kevin Rose: That’s exactly right. That’s exactly right. It makes it your lifelong enemy. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And it binds you to it. And so, you’re like, “Fuck it, Yolo. Let’s have some wine.” Kevin Rose: Well, I want to be bound to it. And then I did that with a glass of wine, so no, but I — Tim Ferriss: Break those chains. Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly. But the plan was never to be sober for life. It was to reevaluate my relationship with alcohol and get to a point where I could truly say to anyone that asks, the cravings have gone away. And my goal going forward is something I just call the 2-2-2 rule, which is maximum of two drinks at any given night, never two days in a row, and then two days a week. So, just lightweight. That’s my new thing. And then also special occasions, I want it to be about a celebration of something or a gathering in some way that’s meaningful, not just because a football game’s on or something. Tim Ferriss: Well, first I have more to say, but cheers. I have my little Japanese mug — Kevin Rose: Cheers. Tim Ferriss: — full of Barr Hill gin. Cheers. Kevin Rose: Wait, wait, straight up gin? Tim Ferriss: That’s just straight gin. I didn’t have any ice. You’ve inspired me to cut way back on my drinking, so I haven’t really had much. I don’t want to open a bottle of wine that I’m not going to finish with friends or something. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I mean, you finished your bottle of gin. Tim Ferriss: So I just grabbed what I had open, which stay good for a long while once open, which was this gin. So, I’m not going to drink a full glass of gin, but I will have a sip with you. Kevin Rose: I think we’re both going to be cheap dates maybe then, because if we haven’t drank in a while, we might get really sloppy really fast. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, very, very cheap dates. So, let me follow up on this story and the 2-2-2 plan. How are you intending, if at all, to catch yourself if you start slipping? Do you have people who you want to hold you accountable? Do you have some type of calendar reminder in place? How do you keep an eye on that? Recognizing that you may very well be totally fine, but given the history that you have, it seems like it’d be a good idea to put some guardrails in there. Kevin Rose: Well, I agree with you wholeheartedly if my issue with alcohol had been one of excess consumption in that, I was never a six or seven drink or even five drink person. For me, it was more consistency. So, the one that is easier to catch is you wake up the next morning and you say, “Okay, I’m just not drinking tonight because you’re catching it in a sober state, which is huge.” So, it’s the big foul that I had over the last few years, especially to start with COVID was just two drinks a night, maybe three, and just continuing that and taking a day or two off a week, that’s not healthy as my liver enzymes would report back. I’m not as concerned about that. But also, I’ve talked to my therapist about this and she’s amazing. And she’s like, “Hey, I’m going to check in with you and just make sure that you’re truly sticking to this.” But I think an accountability partner is absolutely a necessity, especially when it’s been such a staple of your life for decades. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. And I think for you, one thing that immediately hops to mind, which seems super mundane, but I know you have a lot of anxiety around flying, and I don’t think that flying counts as a special occasion, right? So, you’ll need to — Kevin Rose: Oh, it absolutely does. It absolutely does. That flying — Tim Ferriss: You fly so much though. Kevin Rose: We are in the air, we shouldn’t be able to do that as humans. It is an amazing feat of engineering. So, yes, it’s special. Tim, don’t take this away from me, God damn it. Tim Ferriss: All right. Wow, I’m going to — Kevin Rose: This is one thing. Tim Ferriss: I’m going to call that the yellow flag in the making, but you know what — Kevin Rose: I’m fine with one yellow flag. I do fly a bit, but you know what’s funny is when I came back from SFO when I actually had that first drink, I didn’t want a second drink on the plane. And honestly, it’s that just like anxiety of the whole process of it all, the security and the packed jets and the people coughing next to you. And once I get settled, I’m pretty good, unless it’s an international flight and I’m with friends. So, yeah, I think it’s that first drink actually goes a long way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. On that note, first drink goes a long way, especially if it’s just straight up gin. Kevin Rose: There you go. Tim Ferriss: Where else should we segue? Because we can come back to this, but we have a lot to catch up on. There is lot. Kevin Rose: So much to catch up on and why don’t we just go back and forth and just have it be an old school Random Show where everything’s random, we have no idea we’re about to talk about. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s go for it. So, I’ll share an update on my side, which folks might find interesting. As you know and long-term listeners know, I have been one way you could put it as an early adopter looking at bioelectric medicine of different types, whether that is legitimate vagus nerve stimulation. By the way, there aren’t many options that would fall in that category, interviewing people like Dr. Kevin Tracey, but also looking at most acutely transcranial magnetic stimulation. So, TMS, which is a form of brain stimulation. I’ll keep it simple, that has existed for decades. But there was an innovation by the very recently late Nolan Williams, sadly, and others called accelerated TMS, where you basically take something like 50 stimulations, like 50 different sessions. And you compress it into one week, as opposed to doing it over the course of many months. And this type of dense dosing schedule produces some, in many people, incredible effects. And you saw me after my first experience of accelerated TMS, which was with a device called MagVenture device. It uses neuro targeting. So, you need a resting state fMRI and so on to determine where they’re actually going to place this stimulation depending on your condition and your own individual anatomy and activity. So, if it’s depression, they might point it in one direction or in one place. If it’s anxiety or OCD, they might point it somewhere else. And I effectively had, let’s just call it eight or nine out of 10, resting state generalized anxiety. Kevin Rose: Was this self-reported? Meaning, when you went in there to get the resting state scan, were you like, “Hey, I’m coming in here with ED and general anxiety, I need you to treat this for me.” And then they would — Tim Ferriss: Did you say ED? Kevin Rose: Yeah, yeah. I know it’s an issue, but oh, we can cut this if you want. We can cut this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, nice, nice. Very cute. Kevin Rose: No, but all the joking aside — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Kevin Rose: — how did you determine the areas? Did you have to tell them, this is what I’m coming in to treat, or is this something they see? Tim Ferriss: Well, they do interviews and assessments that are qualitative. Let’s just say asking you what your symptoms are, why are you coming here in the first place? Then they would dig into the details and then they would run you through various standardized tests or assessments. So, you might have the MADRS, you might have the HAM-D. You might have the Y-BOCS. They’re different assessments that are accepted as standardized for diagnosing, say OCD or any number of other psychiatric conditions. And then you get an fMRI. So, you get this scan of your brain, which I did at, I think it was Mass General in Massachusetts as you would guess. And based on that, they can do some precision targeting. And just to give people the upshot of that, I did five days of stimulations and that gave me basically three to four months of effectively a zero on a scale of zero to 10 of generalized anxiety. So, from that point forward, effectively, no anxiety. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: The rumination, the anxious mental loops that I would get involved with late at night, that would then in turn affect my sleep and cause onset insomnia, et cetera, that went to zero for a period of say, three to four months, which blew my mind. Kevin Rose: Just out of curiosity, were you tracking Oura data and whatnot, so you could see the impact of this as measured by different devices? Tim Ferriss: I wasn’t looking at Oura at that point in time. I have been tracking with Oura at least for the last three to four weeks. And so, I’m going to be taking a closer look at things like HRB and so on in terms of trending. But the upshot of it is that, and I’ll try to compress this a little bit. But that first time I did accelerated TMS, I had this incredible effect, much more durable in terms of its intensity of effect and relief than even any psychedelic therapy, or psychedelic assisted therapy that I’ve looked into. And those were effectively ended up being the two modalities with the greatest effect size on the psychiatric conditions that I was most personally interested in. And where I have funded a lot of early stage science. Unfortunately, when I then went to do boosters to do shorter duration, two or three days, nothing happened. So, my symptoms started creeping back in, which seemed to be hereditary. Just to put that out there, right? I recognize objectively, I’m like, “There isn’t really anything I should be so anxious about. I recognize that very clearly. Nonetheless, I get caught in these OCD/GAD, generalized anxiety disorder loops, and I see that in family members. So, it seems to be somewhat genetic. In any case, none of these boosters worked. And then I was like, “Fuck, this is terrible. Okay, well let me go back and do the full five days.” Full five days, didn’t do anything. And then I was looking back at the calendar and trying to identify anything that might have correlated, or preceded the first treatment that helped make it work. And I did see that I’d spent a few weeks in the Amazon maybe ending about two weeks prior to that treatment. So, since I was ingesting plants of various types that are known to induce some degree of neuroplasticity, I thought, well, it could be that it was a plasticity issue, a preconditioning that helped that first session. So, I tried to replicate that using psilocybin and did another five days, no effect, didn’t have any effect, and was starting to feel really hopeless about this. But then came across some research that this is going to sound pretty wild, and this is definitely early, early stages. So, to my knowledge, I’m maybe one out of fewer than a hundred people who have been one of the first monkeys shot in the space doing this specifically for anxiety. It has been applied to more people with depression, but decided to try simultaneous dosing with something called D-cycloserine (DCS). So, D-cycloserine, D-C-Y-C-L-O-S-E-R-I-N-E, is very, very interesting. So, it is an antibiotic that historically has been used to treat tuberculosis and urinary tract infections, but it is also now being studied. And for the last several years, people have been looking at this as a cognitive enhancer for treating various neuropsychiatric conditions. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: Now, how they figured this out, I’m not sure. I mean, it could have been working backwards through the purported mechanism of action. So, D-cycloserine has been looked at in conjunction with say, CBT, like cognitive behavioral therapy and all sorts of different things. And part of what people believe makes it effective as an amplifier of effects, although there can be side effects and sometimes the pendulum swings the other direction is that it is a partial agonist at the glycine binding site of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Now, ketamine also works on NMDA receptors, but it’s an antagonist. So, it’s very different in that respect. But I will again try to cut to the punchline. So, instead of doing five days, I did one day, just one day of basically a stimulation every hour on the hour for 10 hours and preloaded with a lozenge that you just let of melt in your mouth with this D-cycloserine, and it worked one day. It had some side effects. I had insomnia for about two weeks, which seems to happen in some patients who have undergone this. Some people have really bad insomnia for a month and then it goes away. And I was willing to take that risk. There’s some other things that can crop up, like temporary loss of some fine motor control and some other weird stuff. Kevin Rose: Oh, Jesus. Tim Ferriss: Tinnitus in some people. Kevin Rose: Wow, with just the treatment in general. Did the papers that you’re signing and say, this may happen? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, with any of this stuff, you’re writing your life away with some signatures. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s like frontier stuff. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, but the point that I’m trying to make here in a pretty long-winded way is number one, it worked. So, that leads me to believe that the original hypothesis that it was around neuroplasticity, so I needed to warm up the Play-Doh before it could be molded properly, could be accurate, right? That could be true. Secondly, and this is incredibly important, most people I know who are really busy, or most people who can’t afford it, can’t take five days off of work. They can’t take a week off of work to do this treatment no matter how bad their symptoms might be. And the fact that this D-cycloserine, like DCS enhanced treatment was able to be compressed into a single day, I feel like it opens up the multitude of people who can potentially use this tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold, who knows? And it should also at the same time really decrease the cost. So, it’s made me even more bullish around accelerated TMS, and it’s been, I’d have to go back and look maybe a month, six weeks, but it’s still sticking, which is remarkable. So, in any case, for people who want to hear more, they can listen to my podcast with Nolan Williams that goes into a lot of detail around this, but very exciting stuff. It turns out a lot of these things might be interrelated and that certain types of TMS when implemented properly actually seem to also stimulate the vagus nerve in some interesting ways. So, this is the next frontier that I’m most interested in exploring right now is bioelectric medicine, right? So, computer chips over pills and so on. I think it allows you, in some respects to get much more targeted. So, that’s good news for me, but I think it’s also obviously at the edges of medicine right now. But I think that in the next two to three years, I could see this becoming a much more accessible therapeutic for millions of people. And there’s some companies you can watch. I mentioned one MagVenture or Magventures. The other is called Brainsway, and they’re actually a very small company, but publicly traded, and I’m sure there are going to be more entrants. So, super exciting stuff. But now I feel like I have a recipe worth trying to replicate where maybe once a quarter, maybe twice a year, depending on when — I think I see symptoms start to creep back in. I don’t think this is a one and done, nor is any psychedelic assisted therapy that I’m aware of. So, I expect it’ll be some type of ongoing treatment that I do one, two to four times per year. Kevin Rose: And when you think of the potential in one and inability to replicate this again in others, I know you put a lot of cash personally into philanthropic things around research and studies, are you curious to push on these buttons and see, can you put together a trial with 50 people and Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Kevin Rose: What’s your thoughts there? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I would definitely be interested in funding more research. The Brain Stimulation Lab at Stanford, I’ve already funded some research within. Very sadly, Nolan Williams, who helped develop a lot of these technologies died, I mean I want to say it was a month or two ago by suicide, very sadly. Kevin Rose: Oh, jeez. Tim Ferriss: And he was a friend and really heartbreaking to see. And I mean it’s hard to put that aside for the moment, but putting it aside for the moment, I did fund research within that lab. I suspect that’s going to take time to implement, particularly given the leadership vacuum that was created by his very, very tragic death. But I am interested in funding more research, and this is an ongoing thing. As you know, my foundation, the Saisei Foundation, has funded all sorts of on the edge research since 2015 or so, I would say. So, this is for sure where I would like to fund more research, particularly looking at these combinations. And that could be something like these, like a D-cycloserine plus stimulation. And at certain clinics, they have cohorts of say 60 — I think it’s at the time that I did it, there were 60 patients who had been treated for some form of anxiety disorder with this combination. I think that at least at that particular clinic on the depression side, the numbers are larger, probably 200 or so. But it’s exciting, it’s exciting. I mean that’s enough to get a signal, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And sure, you need to check all the boxes and do the randomized placebo controlled studies with multiple arms and all that, but it is enough to start to see a signal, especially when you have treatment resistant cases that haven’t responded to other things. And that’s enough to inform at least the design of a study that would take much longer. So, we’ll see. Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: But I will say that much some people experience with GLP-1 agonists like Tirzepatide, and Mounjaro or Ozempic or whatever, after these treatments and maybe it’s just from really putting the brakes on a lot of the OCD like circuitry, that I had much less desire to over consume caffeine, to over consume alcohol. It made dialing all of those things back a lot easier, which has been — Kevin Rose: And you know that’s a massive benefit of GLP-1s for a lot of people? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which is huge. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Well, dude, I’m pumped for you, man. It’s like I love to see you getting some relief here, even if just for a few months, and that’s fantastic, it’s repeatable. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. So, fingers crossed. We’ll see. And for people who want to learn more, I would suggest they start with, as eerie as it might be, my conversation on the podcast with Nolan Williams. All right, man, you’re up. What’s next? Kevin Rose: Speaking of brain-related things, I was out a dinner with a friend and I was lamenting in talking about just my inability to remember faces, names, and then how that extended into childhood for me, which was doing poorly on tests and just I couldn’t quite retain the information the way that my friends could. I just could never explain it. Somebody at dinner, my buddy Mao said to me, “Do you have aphantasia?” And I said, “I have no idea what that is.” And then he said, “Okay, I want you to close your eyes right now,” and this is going to blow some people’s minds right now. “Close your eyes and picture an apple in your mind’s eye. Picture an apple. What do you see? Do you see a red apple? Do you see water droplets on it? Does it look fresh? Does it look like an HD image?” And that’s what he said to me. I go, “What are you talking about?” And he goes, “Well, what does it look like to you?” And I go, “There’s no apple.” He goes, “What do you mean there’s no apple?” And I said, “Well, there’s like an outline, ghosty foggy thing, maybe-ish.” And he goes, “Oh, you have aphantasia.” And I was immediately jumped, whatever, ChatGPT. And I had no idea that people suffer from this condition and it’s in the low single digit percentage of people, and they have no idea that this is a thing where you cannot picture something in your mind’s eye. Had you heard of this before or no? Tim Ferriss: No, I hadn’t until you dropped it in one of our group friend text threads. This was, I guess a couple of weeks ago. But Fantasia is spelled like the Disney movie, but actually no, that would be with an F. It’s aphantasia, A-P-H-A-N-T-A-S-I-A, yeah, is the inability to voluntarily visualize mental images first described in 1880. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: When you close your eyes, what do you see? Because they give you a scale there, and a five is like an HD full on, beautiful apple. What do you see? Do you see a perfect quality apple? Tim Ferriss: So aphantasia can be considered the opposite of hyperphantasia. I am the exact opposite. I have hyper-visual recall and the ability — Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: — to visualize. So I can probably draw the vast majority of restaurants or the floor plans that I’ve ever visited, right? I can absolutely spec it out and have very, very vivid visualization. So I would be on the far other end of the spectrum. Kevin Rose: So when you think of a new idea, do you see it in some ways? Because I feel it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You are very similar to my friend Mike, because I remember Mike and I have a lot of shared flight time with psychedelic experiences, and he was describing how he has almost no visual imagery, and it’s almost purely kinesthetic for him. And that is as hard for me to imagine as it is for him to imagine my experience, which is overwhelmingly explosively visual. Kevin Rose: What’s crazy, dude, is how many things I think I thought were jokes. When people said they counted sheep before they went to bed. I was like, “Oh, that’s funny. Would you count numbers in your head?” But I didn’t know they see sheep. I didn’t know. And if you’re younger, mute the podcast for 10 seconds, I didn’t know the spank bank was a real bank you could visit. I thought I didn’t even know that was a thing. I seriously didn’t — Tim Ferriss: Well, to be clear, it’s not a bank with tellers and — Kevin Rose: No, but it is in your head. Tim Ferriss: — safety security boxes. Kevin Rose: It’s in your head. You can open up the box and go back and see that. I can’t see any of that. It sucks. My buddy from Diggnation Podcast was like, after we stopped recording, he’s like, “”You’ve got to be kidding me. So, you can’t go back and look at people you’ve dated in the past during intimate moments and see, revisualize that?” I’m like, “No, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” And he goes, “Oh, yeah.” He’s like, “Oh,” he felt so bad for me. He was almost starting to cry for me. It’s horrible. It’s horrible. Tim Ferriss: What do you think you have, if anything, developed in compensation of that? Kevin Rose: Well, the one thing that I have never been able to explain is that the feeling side of it, everything is that everything is a feeling. So I have a friend of mine, and I’m not this way, but she composes music and she said that she sees in her head music is represented as colors. And so, when I come up with ideas for projects, I’m not seeing something. I’m traversing a feeling of a path, rather than a visual thing. It’s funny you mentioned the fear of flying. I think part of the reason why I have such a vivid fear of flying is that feeling comes so strong of the plane crashing, not that I see the plane crashing. So, it’s just a different thing, but I wouldn’t trade that for the world. That has served me quite well in investing and seeing around corners early and things of that nature. But when I explain that to people, you feel a new idea. There’s been a bunch of people that have no idea what I’m talking about and something they can’t. I think you can probably have both, but new ideas come from this rising of feeling, not visual, if that makes sense. Tim Ferriss: Wild. I mean, it doesn’t really make sense to me, but it would make sense to my friend Mike. And thinking about all this and hearing about your friend who I think you said sees musical notes as colors, that’s often referred to as synesthesia. And there’s a really amazing little book that I read ages ago. It’s been around for a long time. I’m looking at it right now. It was published in 1987, but it’s 192 pages. Anyone who’s interested in memory and mind and the vast differences between people might be interested in this, it’s called The Mind of a Mnemonist, I think is how it’s pronounced, like mnemonic device, M-N-E-M-O-N-I-S-T, a little book about a vast memory. The author’s name is A.R. Those are initials, A.R. Luria, L-U-R-I-A. And here the description’s very short, so I’ll just read it. “This study explores the inner world of a rare human phenomenon — a man who was endowed with virtually limitless powers of memory. From his intimate knowledge of S., the mnemonist, gained from conversations and testing over a period of almost thirty years, A.R. Luria is able to reveal in rich detail not only the obvious strengths of S.’s astonishing memory but also his surprising weaknesses: his crippling inability to forget, his pattern of reacting passively to life, and his uniquely handicapped personality.” Fascinating, fascinating book that I really recommend to people, but aphantasia, who knew? Kevin Rose: You know who I should talk to is Joshua Waitzkin, because didn’t he say that he feels chess? And for people that don’t know, he was the guy that was based on the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Searching for Bobby Fischer was originally a book and then a movie, which was based on the childhood chess prodigy chapters of Josh Waitzkin’s life. And Josh hates that term prodigy. He has some unusual hardware to be sure, but he also has a really incredible framework that he’s applied to now four or five different fields to become world-class in all of them. But he does have a feeling about certain things. One of the stories that he has told me is he was playing a simul, which means he was playing, I don’t know what the number was, 30 or 20 to 40 people simultaneously where he is walking around a room and playing — Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, you do it really fast, right? You just look and then move. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he’s just moving from table to table really quickly, and I think was with some very high level high school players, something like that. Maybe they were younger, I can’t recall. But he was going around, he’s playing 20 or 30 simultaneous games in his head. And then at one point, he explained it as it feels like you’re juggling 20 or 30 balls in the air. And then he got to one table and he felt all the balls come crashing to the ground. Kevin Rose: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And he said, it felt as though I just missed a ball, and they’d all fallen on the ground, and he couldn’t quite figure out why that was the case. And then he was able to deduce that one of the kids had cheated, one of the kids had moved a piece. Kevin Rose: Oh, no way. Tim Ferriss: And it was just a gut feeling. And then that visual that allowed him to figure out which of the kids had cheated. It’s just insane. Kevin Rose: Holy shit. Tim Ferriss: That people can even do that. Yeah, yeah. Josh. Yeah, if you want to listen to Joshua Waitzkin’s first ever podcast, you were podcast episode number one, and he was podcast episode number two, if I remember correctly. Kevin Rose: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Wild character. Oh, man. Let’s see. Kevin Rose: All right, you’re up. Tim Ferriss: I’m up. Well, I’ll give another medical one that I think is interesting. And I’ve been texting and interacting with Matt Walker a lot on this. Matt is a scientist. He wrote a book, Why We Sleep, and is about as credible as you can be within the world of sleep science and — Kevin Rose: He’s the best. And he’s a great human. Tim Ferriss: He’s a great guy. Kevin Rose: Fantastic human. Tim Ferriss: Great guy, has the most pleasing dulcet tones with that British accent and kind lilt in the voice. Kevin Rose: Plus 10 IQ accent, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Plus 10 or 20 IQ points with the accent. But his podcast is also excellent, and we can link to it in the show notes, but he did an episode on a class of sleep medication called DORAs and DORA stands for dual orexin receptor antagonists. And the reason that DORAs became very interesting to me is that I have Alzheimer’s in my family, and it’s left right and center for me right now because I have three relatives currently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and I — Kevin Rose: Holy shit. That’s your APOE e4 negative folks? Tim Ferriss: It includes APOE e4 negative folks. So, we won’t get too far into the genetics, but people who should not be, based on that particular parameter, should not be particularly inclined to Alzheimer’s, nonetheless have Alzheimer’s. And then there are of course people who have three, four, I don’t think any of them are APOE e33, I am APOE e34. So, compared to a 33 that, at least, as I understand it would predispose me and say 2.5 times. Kevin Rose: You and my wife and Rhonda Patrick, and Attia, too, actually is a 34. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there you go. Kevin Rose: All of you guys. I’m the only one that’s not. Crazy. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, in effect, to our current understanding, you want to mitigate the accumulation of two things, is one is beta amyloid plaque, another is tangles that are created by tau proteins. And sleep is really imperative for this. And if you have sleep issues as I have for decades, the onset insomnia, low percentage of deep sleep, et cetera, you’re effectively unable to have your garbage service within the brain clear out these at a rate that offsets the accumulation. Kevin Rose: But we don’t know if these are causal, right? There’s never been any conclusion whether these are causal. They’re most likely the protective effects of something else gone awry. Do you agree with that? Tim Ferriss: I would say that, based on our best understanding, if you can mitigate the accumulation of these things, there seems to be, at the very least, delaying of the progression of these diseases. And there are different drugs and fusions like Donanemab and so on that are predicated on that understanding of the mechanism. This is still early days in the world of Alzheimer’s, but it seems very defensible with our understanding currently that the less of this stuff you accumulate, the better off you are. Kevin Rose: Do you follow Dale Bredesen’s work, by the way? Tim Ferriss: I don’t. Let’s come back to that. Kevin Rose: Okay. Tim Ferriss: Let me just quickly tie this up and say that an example of a DORA would be Belsomra. There are many others, or I should say a handful of others, but I have taken as I believe you have — well, actually no, it was too strong for you, but — Kevin Rose: I gave you some, dude. Tim Ferriss: Well, yeah, that’s right. You gave me the Belsomra. Kevin Rose: I gave you a bunch of Belsomra and you were going to give me some other shit back and you never gave me anything good. Tim Ferriss: Well, hold on, hold on. That’s still pending, but let me come back. So, you gave me the Belsomra, but I said using it, I was going to get it on a prescription. It’s expensive as fuck. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I paid a shit-ton for it, and then I didn’t use it. Tim Ferriss: And I was like, all right, I’ll take your Belsomra. But the Trazodone, I got off of Trazodone and switched as a sleep medication to, in this case, Belsomra, because it was literally down the street in an Uber at your house, not recommending you use your friend’s bootleg drugs, by the way, talk to your doctor, but — Kevin Rose: We also have physicians that are looking at all our shit, so it’s not — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, right. But I have been, now, on Belsomra for a few months as hopefully a — it’s too strong to say it’s a preventative strategy, but at least a delay strategy for potentially Alzheimer’s and other associated neurodegenerative conditions. So, I would encourage people, and I’ll link to this in the show notes, to check out Matt Walker’s podcast on this specifically. Kevin Rose: You know what they did with Belsomra where they tap the spines of people that took it and they noticed there were less tau, the proteins in the spinal fluid? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they cleared a lot more. I mean, I think it was they looked at animal models and then they looked at humans. And in that podcast episode also, Matt discusses data related to comparing, say Belsomra or I should say DORAs to Ambien, right? And not all sleep medications are created equal. A lot of sleep medications effectively sedate you. But in the case of DORAs, orexin, as I understand it, is a wakefulness. Hmm, I think it’s a hormone, but this is effectively inhibiting wakefulness as opposed to sedating. And by using that particular approach, you’re able to create more naturalistic sleep. So it’s preserving sleep architecture, increasing certain things like REM sleep. In any case, it’s very interesting because as it stands, look, sure, like exercise for a natural release of cloth, watch your diet, blah, blah, blah. There are a handful of things here. Sleep, super critically important if we’re talking about, again, staving off, hopefully neurodegenerative disease, but there really just aren’t that many tools in the toolkit. So, to come across some of this data via Matt Walker was very eye-opening to me. So, that’s — Kevin Rose: That’s awesome. Tim Ferriss: That’s also something that I’m looking at really closely. Kevin Rose: I will say the scariest test I have done in my life was about three months ago. I went and had my blood work done and had the towel, the full on, you can check your blood now to see if you are producing, or we’re always producing it, but if you’re out of bounds, meaning you’re above the norm in your production of these types of proteins. And if you are, it’s like 99 percent chance you’re on the path to some form of dementia, right? And did you do that test? Tim Ferriss: I have just done a whole battery of different tests. And — Kevin Rose: Did you do the p-tau one though? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m going to have all that stuff. So, I will — Kevin Rose: It’s scary, dude. You come hang with me, we’ll have a drink or something. Tim Ferriss: I’m looking at all my results in probably two or three weeks because I have a few online batteries that I’m going to do assessments. Kevin Rose: It is absolutely terrifying because the doctor was like, “Hey, do you want to do this? I have this available.” And I was like, “Sure, go ahead.” And then three days afterwards, I’m like, “I should look up what that test is all about.” And there’s three of them now that can detect these various proteins that are essentially, if you have elevated levels, you’re on marching orders or you’re heading towards some type of dementia. And I realized that and I was like, “Wow, if this comes back positive, this is an emergency situation where high intensity interval training every single morning for an hour. There’s a lot of things you have to get into.” And it’s a very frightening thing. It’s a very frightening thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it can be super frightening. And there’s certain other things that I think are just holistically good for my particular goals, cognitive, psychological, physical, like the ketogenic diet. I recently did a podcast with David Baszucki, the co-founder and CEO of Roblox, and he and his wife have a foundation that it is the largest funder of science related to metabolic therapies with a particular focus on ketogenic therapy. So, I will be doing all of December in ketosis as an example. Kevin Rose: Oh, that’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, just to keep that metabolic machinery humming because I do think it’s plausible that it could help longterm with a lot of the stuff we’re talking about. Kevin Rose: So, Tim, real quick, just to put a bow on this, Dale. Yeah, so the reason I like Dale, Dale’s a scientist that studies all forms of dementia. He has a book called The End of Alzheimer’s. You’ve probably heard of that book. It’s pretty popular. Tim Ferriss: I’ve come across his name. Yeah. Kevin Rose: He’s a little bit different than most of the scientists out there where he believes that Alzheimer’s and these other dementias, they’re not just a one size fits all, one thing went wrong, but it can be a suite of different things that go wrong that lead you down this path. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kevin Rose: And so, it’s metabolic disorder, it’s potential toxins. I think he’s like the four major contributors to different various forms of dementia. And he’s developed this protocol that can stabilize and even reverse a lot of this early cognitive decline if you catch it early enough. And it’s a little bit of throwing the whole kitchen sink at it because it’s everything. And he’s not quite sure exactly what is doing in the fix here, but it’s fascinating, the research that he’s done, two things that stood out to me that he recommends is one, getting this p-tau test done on the blood front and then also recommends the ketogenic diet. And this ketogenic diet is huge for people. And he’s seen that alone stabilize people from mental decline. And not that they’re not eventually going to get it, but the point is, do you want to go into full decline within five years or do you want it to be 15 years, right? And so, that’s what his lab’s focused on. Tim Ferriss: Cool. Yeah, I’ll check him out. I mean I’ve seen, not that this is a necessarily sustainable or scalable approach, but with some of my relatives with Alzheimer’s where it’s pretty progressed and they tend to give one word answers or get confused and give the wrong answer to questions, giving them, say, 35 milliliters of exogenous ketones. So, they’re not in ketosis, they’re following the terrible diet they’ve always followed, but give them 35 milliliters of high octane exogenous ketones before going for a walk. And within 30 minutes, they’re speaking in full sentences. I mean, you see some really wild temporary, but nonetheless, very interesting transformations, which comes back to what you said about metabolic syndrome. And there are good reasons why some folks refer to Alzheimer’s as type three diabetes, right? Kevin Rose: A hundred percent. And that’s what he says in his book. He’s like, that is definitely a contributor, like excess blood glucose levels and all the downstream inflammation effects that come from that. It’s Bad News Bears, as you like to say. That’s Tim Ferriss is — Tim Ferriss: Bad News Bears. All right, Kevin, what have you got? Kevin Rose: I wanted to give people a quick little update on the State of the Union around all things AI. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, please. I could use it too. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s just such a fascinating time in that every, I’d call it four to eight weeks, maybe a slight bit longer, sometimes less so, we’re seeing leapfrogs in what is possible. And one of the things that I would caution people against is forming an opinion about AI and then locking yourself in time around that opinion. I’ll give you a great practical example. I have a lot of engineers that said, “Hey, I tried AI for coding. It was horrible. My first question is, when did you try it? And they said, “Oh, three months ago.” And I’m like, “No, no, you don’t understand. It’s three to four times better than it was three months ago,” right? And so, we have to make sure that even if you are looking at some of these technologies and say, “Hey, it can’t do X or it’s horrible, it’s hallucinating in this way. It’s giving me the wrong answer. This is without a doubt the massive Motorola block phone version of the iPhone.” We are in that realm of AI, the very first innings of it all and every few months. I mean even Opus four or five came out three, four days ago, whatever, it’s a means — Tim Ferriss: Explain what that is. Kevin Rose: Okay, so when you think about frontier models, meaning do you have the bigs Anthropic, you’ve got Google, you’ve OpenAI, OpenAI, and then I’d throw a couple others in there, Meta’s trying in some sense and perplexity and whatnot. But when you think about the big massive models that are running that are at the bleeding edge of all this, meaning they’re the best of the best, the most expensive per query, what happens is they have to train these data sets and then they go in and they eventually release a model, right? And these are typically marked by software versioning numbers know ChatGPT 3 versus ChatGPT 4 versus ChatGPT 5, and then they’ll do 51, 52 or 41, 42 or whatever. So, it’s like software kind of versioning on these models. And whenever you see a new release, you’re talking a jump in terms of both sometimes the capacity to understand information, and they call that the token context windows. And then also their just natural built-in abilities of the things that they can do well. And so, some things they can do at a graduate level now, some things they can do, their novel ideas is still pretty low down the chain in terms of what they can do around original thinking. But they have all these benchmarks, so they have probably 15 or 20 different benchmarks that they run it against. Can it complete the bar exam is one, right? And so, now they’re able to do it, and then now the question is how quickly can they do it in? It would take them 25 minutes before now it’s five minutes. So, then there’s a bunch of inference side of benchmarking as well. So, we’re seeing Gemini 3 came out just a couple of weeks ago and it was fantastic. And I will say that I called NVIDIA on here way back in the day. It was 1.8 trillion I think back in the day when I said, “Hey, I think this is going to run, when you and I were talking about it,” and it did because I knew GPUs were just going to be the most precious commodity we have as technologists. I have seen that Google now is in the driver’s seat here and I’m really excited for them because one, I worked at Google, they acquired one of my companies and I spent a few years there. And I’ve seen inside the belly of the, and I will tell you that they were built for this day and age, the fact that they’ve been training their entire life for this moment. They have all of the PhDs and all of the folks that they need to go pull this off across the entire suite. And so, what do I mean by the entire suite? And this is where it gets really interesting, Tim. If you think about what OpenAI has to do to compete, they have to go and buy up as much data center space as possible, and they have to buy a shit ton of GPUs from NVIDIA. That’s what they need because they don’t own the stack. They own the software, the training, the engineering, the soft good side of the business, but they don’t own the hardware side. This is a fantastic, really interesting stat. When Gemini three came out a couple weeks ago, it was the first time they had trained a frontier model. The best of best when it dropped, it was the best model in the world exclusively on Google chips. So, they have these chips called TPUs, tensor processing units. They have the full stack dude, they don’t even need NVIDIA. It’s wild. They didn’t use an NVIDIA chip to train their AI and they have world-class AI. So, it’s just really exciting. This is such a fun time to be alive because right now, you can take someone that is a technologist in the sense that they have a rough understanding of the available tech that’s out there, and you could build and produce and ship any app that you want within a few days now with what we have, and it’s just going to get better and better. So, the creativity and the shipping unlockments that we’re about to see over the next five years is going to be unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. If you have the idea for an app or a product or service, anything digital, you will be able to take it from ideation and drawing it on a piece of paper to actual shipping something to your customers within, call it less than a week, which is just never been done before at a price that is, I don’t know, $500, right? And so, if Tim wanted his own app five years ago, I’d have been like, “Okay, great. You want the Tim Ferriss fan site/ed help app, then to build that would be 50 grand,” right? Tim Ferriss: I feel like you have a problem that we need to talk about. You’re just bringing it up so much. After that half a glass of champagne, I feel like — Kevin Rose: It went straight to my head, number one and number two — Tim Ferriss: Turning into a mini confessional here. Kevin Rose: We need to talk about your relationships because one of the things that whenever I get on — Tim Ferriss: Oh, boy. Kevin Rose: No, I’m telling you whenever we do a Random Show, people are always like, they send me messages and they’re like, “I love how you give him shit, number one, and number two, we want to hear more about his personal life.” And I know you’ve got a new special someone in your life, which I’m very excited for. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we can talk about that. Yeah, nice segue. Kevin Rose: Let’s jump into that. Now that we’ve covered Google, let’s jump into your personal life. Tim Ferriss: Hold on, hold on, hold on. I want to ask you for a counterpoint on a previous, I wouldn’t call it necessarily a prediction, but we talked about, I think it was in the last episode of The Random Show, a bit about venture capital. And I wouldn’t say that you said across the board, venture capital would be dead because there are capital intensive businesses that require — Kevin Rose: Yeah, hardware. Tim Ferriss: — hardware and build out and wet labs and all this stuff. But I’m wondering if I just put on my future vision goggles, which I wish I had, but let’s just pretend I do and I look forward, it doesn’t need to be five years. I look forward two years. And what you are describing is a reality, right? The barrier to entry, the hurdle is so low that suddenly from ideation to product takes a week. And there is an absolute glut, this just overwhelming tsunami of products. Now, on the positive side, yes, what would’ve cost people millions and millions of dollars to do 10 years ago, let’s say, 15 years ago, suddenly AWS and rentable infrastructure comes along, that cost goes down. Now AI comes along, cost further goes down. Kevin Rose: Sure. Tim Ferriss: But I imagine the war for attention is going to get so incredibly expensive. Do you think that products that get traction will nonetheless, if they don’t have the income stream to support it, raise venture capital purely for a marketing war chest and customer acquisition? I’m just wondering if you think you could make the argument that the customer acquisition costs are going to get, or user acquisition costs are going to get so high because everyone, you’re going to have a hundred X the number of bidders now who knows what the form will be. I don’t know if it’ll be Google AdWords, maybe it’ll be something else. What are your thoughts? Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think, well, there’s a couple things there. The best products I’ve ever invested in, period, full stop, have been ones that don’t rely upon paid acquisition to grow. So, they have come up with something that is unique and novel enough to where word of mouth is their number one driver. That said, capital and deployed the right way and spent the right way around. Ad purchases is just fuel for the fire, which is great. And so, the thing VC is dead in the sense that the seed round was like, “Okay, I have a idea-ish. I’m going to go out and take $3 million and I’m going to give away 20 percent of my company.” What happens in the future is not that you don’t need that capital, because I think you’re right. You will need it for a variety of things. If you’re hitting insane scale, there will be moments where you need to put more warm bodies in seats to help you do all the things, and you may need to raise venture. But the difference is when you have product market fit, you go from raising and selling 20 percent of your business for $3 million to selling 20 percent of your business for $15 million, which is just fantastic for the entrepreneur. So, it’s not that venture is dead, it’s just that what we’re going to see is the entrepreneur is in control like they’ve never been before, which is fantastic. And if they say, “Okay, I’m off to the races and things are going so well, but guess what? I’m actually charging for my product and I’m breakeven.” You don’t ever have to raise VC. And then now you own a hundred percent of the business and you’re a Jason Fried, which we know is one of the most brilliant entrepreneurs of our time that invented SaaS that just has never taken any external investment. And you are just happy and you don’t report to anyone, which is a beautiful thing as well. Tim Ferriss: So, do you think it’s just like the killing fields for early stage folks and the value capture just gets pushed to later and later stage. Kevin Rose: Pushed out. Tim Ferriss: Right? Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think that’s right. And I think largely on just tech, that is it’s understandable by AI. Meaning, if you’re running TypeScript or any of these languages that AI can figure out and write high quality code for, you just don’t need to raise capital. You can do it nights and weekends on your own. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Amazing. Okay. So, is it fair to say if you had to bet on one horse in the AI race that you would bet on Google? And then I have a follow-up question. Kevin Rose: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: Well, now I know a little bit too much behind the scenes. If you had no stake in any companies, how would you please — Kevin Rose: Well, I never answer like that. I would always give you the true answer, even if I didn’t — Tim Ferriss: No, I know. I’ve got to say it, but yeah, where would you put first, second, third bet? Kevin Rose: Honestly, these valuations, I wouldn’t put a single dollar into the top three or five, largely because what are you going to do? Is Google going to 3X in the next 10 years? Tim Ferriss: Well, also, it remains to be seen how much AI cannibalizes their current money-printing machine in terms of search and sponsored ads and so on. Kevin Rose: I’m less worried about that because they own the largest distribution platform on Earth, which is Android. And so, they will find a way in there. And then also I think if Google had to pick their poison and say, “Okay, you can either base the future business off a $25 a month pro subscription to Gemini or a free account that is just ad-driven,” I think they’ll take that hybrid model all day long. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, that’s a good point. Interesting. Okay, so you wouldn’t put any money into the big ones. So, do you choose then? Are you trying to find Amazon in 1998, 1999, right? Just in the absolute noise of — AI slop doesn’t just apply to Sora, it also applies to startups, right? There’s so much bullshit floating around. Some of it’s dressed up in very fancy clothing with fancy names, right? So, if you’re investing in AI writ large, how do you even — I mean, this is your job, right? Kevin Rose: I think there’s three buckets. I think there’s three buckets. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I have to think about it. Kevin Rose: One is power. Without a doubt, we’re all going to need power. Small nuclear reactors are going to be a thing. The United States needs 3 to 5Xs power capacity in the next decade, if not more. And there is going to be a huge push into energy. So, there’s a bunch of plays there. You can look them up. There are even ETFs that track bundles of nuclear-related companies that are out there. That’s one play. I think power is without a doubt, the most important piece of this. And then data centers. There’s publicly traded data center companies out there. There are the bigs like Microsoft and Google and Amazon that are just expanding as fast as they possibly can and buying up land all over the United States. There’re always going to be a premium on that. They’re going to need that. NVIDIA, they’ve got competition from AMD, they’ve got competition from Google now. Obviously, they have such incredible tooling on the software side, there’s a lot of defensibility there. It’s a name to own. Would I buy in today at today’s prices? I don’t know. But I will say that if you think of this, less about, I’m just going to pick one horse and more like I’m going to pick a basket of things, these are the things that I would be putting into that basket. And then lastly, I would take large companies that have insane bloat from headcount that can be automated in the next, call it two to three years, where they will reduce sadly, and I hate to see this happen, but it’s going to happen no matter what. They’re going to reduce their headcount. They’re going to automate with AI and their profit margins are going to go through the roof. And I think those companies will reap the benefits of efficiency that comes from AI and their stock prices will as well. Tim Ferriss: How do you identify companies that have the most bloat with also the fewest hurdles to adopting AI for what you’re describing, right? Because some of them, they may be, who knows, just put in a position where from a process or regulatory perspective or whatever, they just can’t do it, at least in the near term. Kevin Rose: Yeah, in the near term, it’s listening to earnings calls and it is, I want to hear the CEO e saying that they are absolutely forcing their engineers to use AI forcing. You have to be, it is not optional at this point. To ask your engineers to play with it, you have to be using it every single day in your workflow. And the folks that are doing that, even though it’s not perfect today, they’re going to reap all the benefits 12 to 18 months from now. And so, that’s what I’m looking for more than anything else is who is wise enough? Because a lot of the CEOs are old. Who is wise enough to say it’s true, we know these folks and they just don’t — If you ask them the difference between Haiku 4, 5, and Sonnet, they would have no idea how to tell you. If they can’t answer those basic model related questions, what are you doing? So, it’s finding those people like the Jack Dorseys in the world and the folks that are just like — well, I wouldn’t want to say young because I want to be Asian, but they have to be leaning into this in a way that they have to believe that their entire business is going to be rebuilt from the ground up over the next, call it five years. And you have people like Salesforce, CEOs doing that. Obviously, Benioff’s on board with this. There’s a handful of folks that have said, “We are making sure this is a mandate from the top down.” Google did this quite well where they had this red alarm, or thing that they called off probably three years ago, where it said it is all hands on deck AI and Apple did not do that. And now look what’s happening. Most likely, Apple’s going to end up licensing Gemini from Google. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Wild world out there, kids. Wild world. Kevin Rose: Yeah. It’s a fun time to be alive, man. It’s fun to be playing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. Let’s see. I figure I could give people some maybe holiday gift ideas just in case they’re — Kevin Rose: Oh, yes, I’ve got some great ones. First thing I can recommend, something you can fit in your pocket. So, this right here looks like a golf ball with little, not quite spikes, but studs on it. They’re flattened. This is called a Rubz ball, R-U-B-Z, and I travel with this. You just roll out your feet on this before you go to bed and I have felt this helped everything from relaxing and just winding down. What I have noticed, and this is something I spoke with Ed Coan about a hundred years ago, long time ago. He’s the greatest powerlifter of all time, phenomenal athlete and very nice guy. But basically if you address your feet, sometimes you feel it all the way up the kinetic chain, your forelegs, knees, even your low back can sometimes release. So this, I think it cost less than 10 bucks. This is a Rubz ball. You can buy it on Amazon anywhere else. That’s a very easy one. That’s just pocket sized. We can go back and forth. What have you got? What you — Kevin Rose: Yeah, let’s do it. Okay, so this one is awesome, dude. You have my doc that I sent you right with the links to everything? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I do. Kevin Rose: I don’t know if you have it up in front of you. So, if you click on the second one down these bonsai Nanoblocks. So, I’ve been talking about Nanoblocks for a while. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you are. Kevin Rose: Hear me out, dude. This is a fun stocking stuffer. People are going to love this shit. So, it’s $38. It’s these little baby bonsai trees. Nanoblocks are like LEGOs, but they’re like one 10th of the size. So, you need tweezers to assemble them. It is oddly satisfying to build these little tiny bonsai trees. You get all six of them for $38 and if you use the code, Tim — no, there’s no code, but they’re amazing. They’re so fun. Anyway, Nanoblocks are awesome. This is a little fun little pack, great stocking stuffer. They’re super tiny and they’re cute. Look, there’s Nanoblocks up there behind me. See that beautiful tree? Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. There it is. So you recommended a book to me. Do you want to mention it? It’s last in your list. I bought the audiobook and I listened to it on my flights recently. I thought the narrator was really, really good also. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s called Stop Fixing Yourself: Wake Up, All Is Well. It’s by Anthony De Mello, who we were talking about the Jesuit priest and therapist that we talked about earlier. Tim, we had both somehow discovered this book originally. Not this book, but the other one we’re talking about. Tim Ferriss: Awareness. Kevin Rose: Awareness. And it was really cool to hear that you were into it because it was one of my favorite books that we did not compare notes and we read this independently. I don’t know how the hell that happened, but we both loved it. And this is another one where I was just like, “This is so good because there’s so many core truths here that apply to my practice on the meditation side and I just loved it.” But it does require a little bit of understanding. It’s not like someone from off the street can totally read this and be like, “Oh, that makes a ton of sense to me.” I don’t know if you felt that way. Tim Ferriss: I feel like, well, there are two things I would say. Just having read a lot of Anthony De Mello that I think Awareness, subtitle, Conversations with the Masters, it used to be The Perils and Promise of Reality, but they changed the subtitle. I preferred the old one, but Awareness by Anthony De Mello. His last name is two words, D-E M-E-L-L-O is 184 pages and I’ve gifted it to at least 50 people. I mean, I have an entire bookshelf full of this book in my guest bedroom at my house just to give friends. Kevin Rose: Yeah, same, dude. It’s so funny. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And I would recommend people read Awareness first. I don’t think you need anything special in terms of background for that. Kevin Rose: Well, you do need one thing. You need to know that it is a lecture, so it reads like a lecture. It doesn’t read like a book. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which I like, which I like and he’s very no-nonsense. Kevin Rose: I gave it to a couple of friends and they started reading it and they’re like, “Wait, is this a talk that he gave?” I’m like, “Oh, yeah, yeah, I should have told you that. It’s an actual talk.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s a collection of polished lectures that he gave. So, Awareness would be the first. And then in the case of the Stop Fixing Yourself, I really enjoyed it. There’s a lot of overlap with Awareness. So, there are certain points that get reiterated. The audiobook rendition of Stop Fixing Yourself is very, very good. I disagree with some of the conclusions which are effectively along the lines — I shouldn’t say, this might sound unfair, but in the conclusion, he talks about how ultimate freedom is not depending on anyone for anything and you could be perfectly happy in isolation by yourself. And I was like, “Evolutionarily. I think that’s actually a pretty hard sell.” But what I would suggest is if you listen to or read these books, as with any book, expect that you’re going to disagree with and maybe even discard 10 percent, 20 percent of it, but don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. These are really, really helpful books. Kevin Rose: Well said. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, let me grab another one here. I’ll recommend two others in case people are interested in books. So, fiction, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. I think it might just be Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. Anyway, it’s tomorrow three times by Gabrielle Zevin, Z-E-V-I-N. It’s a fiction book and it was on the New York Times’ list of the hundred best books of the 21st century. It’s a new one and it is all about entrepreneurship and game design and love unrequited. And when I recommended this book initially in 5-Bullet Friday, my newsletter, one of my attorneys who helped craft the agreement for Coyote, another stocking stuffer, the card game that I made which is 20 — Kevin Rose: Yeah, I know this is on a Black Friday sale, by the way, it’s 38 percent off on Amazon right now or something like that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s 7.99 right now. It’s doing super well there. The reviews are great. It’s like 4.7 or 4.8 stars. Kevin Rose: Man, I’m so proud of you, dude. This is so cool to see you having success here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, thanks man. Kevin Rose: I thought you were going to do The 5-Hour Body and I was like, “Ah, you probably shouldn’t go there,” and it’s nice to see you doing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, it’s been super fun. But my attorney, who helped with the negotiations on deal structuring for Coyote, specializes in video games and he’s been involved with some epic deals and amazing mergers and acquisitions and all this crazy stuff. And he texted me after I put that in the newsletter and he said, “That book is so good. It was eerie because it is so accurate down to the finest detail that it felt like somebody was looking over my shoulder when I was doing these deals.” That is how well researched this book is. You would love it. I really think you would enjoy it. Kevin Rose: My old assistant, Sarah, who’s amazing, she gifted it to me and it burned in the fire when my house burned down. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you’ve got to read it. Kevin Rose: But I need to get it because she was like, “You’ve got to listen to this book.” Tim Ferriss: Oh, it’s so good. Yeah, it’s great. And then the last one I’ll recommend just because we gave some nonfiction, then just gave fiction. I’ll give poetry, which people might not expect, but it’s a little tiny compilation. This also has an entire shelf in my guest room. It’s called Gold, it’s by Rumi. And then the translator, Haleh Liza Gafori, last name G-A-F-O-R-I, 112 pages. And it is just an incredible collection of poetry, of course, originally by the great Persian mystic Rumi, but with incredible new translations by Haleh Liza Gafori, who is an American poet of Persian descent. So, she’s a native speaker and also, she herself a poet and musician. So, if you read one or two of these poems before you go to bed at night, it just makes everything better. So I would also just recommend. I can keep going with gift recommendations, but I suspect you have more. I would like to mention anymore. Kevin Rose: Oh, I’ve got some great ones, dude. Yeah, absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t we do two at a time? Why don’t you do two and then I’ll do another two. Kevin Rose: Okay. I’m going to make you a multi-billionaire from how many people buy this next one, I’m going to say with your Amazon affiliate link. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Kevin Rose: This right here, my friend, is the best purchase I’ve ever made in my life. Tim Ferriss: Whoa, that’s a strong statement. Kevin Rose: Okay, maybe not, but it’s high up there. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, okay. Kevin Rose: Have you ever been in one of those situations where you need a small, little screwdriver or a screw head and you can’t find the right one that fits? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: This is 25 different micro, everything from hex nuts to screwdrivers to flatheads, and it’s a magnetic little insert into the actual one. Now you think, okay, who cares? But it’s $7.79 and it acts like a $25 screwdriver. It is the best stocking stuffer in the world. Once a year or twice a year you’ll get something where it takes two double As or whatever, and there’s a little, tiny screwdriver thing you’ve got to undo. Tim Ferriss: Totally. Kevin Rose: Where am I going to find something that fits that? This is that thing. And then when you want to tweak your glasses or whatever, you need those micro screwdrivers. Dude, $7, this thing rocks. It’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: How did you find this thing? Kevin Rose: It had good reviews on Amazon. I bought it and when I got it, I was like, they should be charging three times as much for this thing. The torque doesn’t actually ruin the bit heads, which is great because oftentimes with the cheaper ones, the bit heads get ruined. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: Anyway. You have to have it in every junk drawer in your house. It’s one of those things. But I love these things. Back in the day, when you were doing 5-Bullet Friday where you wanted me to contribute stuff, you would say, “Hey, what’s the best thing under $50, or whatever, that you love?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. This is it. Kevin Rose: This is one of those things that’s under $10 that is absolutely worth every penny. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, love it. All right. So under $10, I don’t know if it’s $10, might be a little bit more, but in addition to the Rubz ball, I’ll just give a couple of quickfire. There’s something called the Alpha Ball by Tune Up Fitness. It was actually introduced to me by Nsima Inyang, or Inyang, I think is how he pronounces it, but you sent me his video, so you are responsible — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — for me ultimately connecting with him. But this Alpha Ball for rolling out your hips, for traveling with, it’s about the size of a softball, but it’s just the perfect density and texture, you can get everywhere you need to get, which you cannot do with a foam roller, nor is it easy to travel with a foam roller. I just love this thing. I use it pretty much every day. So, that’s the two — Kevin Rose: I didn’t see it on video. Did you hold it up? Tim Ferriss: No, I have it downstairs in my suitcase actually. But the — Kevin Rose: Okay, let me look it up. What’s it called again? Tim Ferriss: Alpha Ball by Tune Up Fitness. You can find it on Amazon. It’s 19.99, more than worth every penny. I can send you a link to it, of course. Kevin Rose: Sweet. Tim Ferriss: Then other things I’ll throw in there, this is going to be one of those things. This is my version of your little TED talk that you just gave on the — Kevin Rose: Screwdrivers. Tim Ferriss: — $7 screwdrivers where people are like, “You’ve got to be kidding me.” This is my version of that, which is the — I don’t know how to pronounce this, Maestri, M-A-E-S-T-R-I. Maestri House rechargeable milk frother. All right. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know. Right? Kevin Rose: Mine was better than that, but — Tim Ferriss: Hold on — Kevin Rose: Keep going. Tim Ferriss: — hold on, hold on. I have owned so many of these frothers for coffee, for tea, for whatever, protein shakes or whatever, these little hand frothers. They always — Kevin Rose: They all break. They all suck, dude. Tim Ferriss: They all break, or the batteries die and then you can’t recharge it, or it’s — Kevin Rose: Yes. Tim Ferriss: — like an outboard motor and you’re like, oh, let me just do this for my tea and relax, and it shoots liquid all over the place. Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: There’s so many issues. This thing is like the Lamborghini of milk frothers. It costs — Kevin Rose: Ooh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It costs how much? 30 bucks. It’s not that crazy. Kevin Rose: It’s USB-C 2 charging. That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It’s USB-C. You basically turn the very top of it to adjust in any increment you want the intensity of the agitation. I have to tell you, I asked somebody on my team to just do diligence and get me a frother that would solve all these problems that I mentioned. He knows how to do a lot of research and this was his conclusion, and I got it and I was like, “Where has this been all my life? Oh, my God.” Has almost 3,000 reviews, or 2,600 reviews, 4.5 stars. This thing is just amazing. I use it every day. That’s one. When I put this in 5-Bullet Friday, what I wrote was, “It reminds me of Sage Wisdom from Kevin Kelly,” who is the founding editor of — Kevin Rose: Oh, I love Kevin Kelly. Tim Ferriss: — Wired magazine. Amazing guy. Kevin Rose: Yeah. We did a walk with him together. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. He had, at that time, I think it was a draft of a book that he put together, this tiny book called Excellent Advice for Living, which are these pithy little quotes from Kevin that he used to put in his — I think they were his birthday letters to friends where he’d be like, “Here are the 10 things I learned this year.” One of his pieces of advice is, “Take note if you find yourself wondering where is my good knife or where is my good pen. That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those.” I have shelves full of shitty frothers that have been sent to me or that I’ve bought and they’re just terrible, so I just got rid of all of them and replaced them with this thing. Kevin Rose: That’s so awesome. Tim Ferriss: Other things, real quick: microphone. I got this microphone for travel called the Elgato, one word. Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, I love Elgato. Tim Ferriss: Elgato Wave:3. It is a gorgeous piece of design. It makes me think of Braun design back in the day, B-R-A-U-N, and it actually solves, somehow, bounce and echo better than even this fancy mic, this Shure mic that I’m speaking into right now. It is really impressive. I don’t know what they do with the firmware, software, whoever the hell designs these types of things, but this has become my favorite travel mic, is the Elgato Wave:3. Also, not that expensive. Kevin Rose: Have you seen their prompter by the way? They make a tiny, little prompter — Tim Ferriss: I haven’t seen it. Kevin Rose: — if you want to read scripts or anything like that. Oh, Elgato makes this beautiful, little prompt you can control with an iPhone or an iPad. For people that are doing monologues and podcasts and stuff like that, Elgato is some great gear and it’s not that expensive. It’s well priced. Tim Ferriss: This one, the Wave:3 — I’ll check out the prompter — it’s got almost 10,000 reviews, 4.7 stars, 150 bucks. I rely on it to the extent that I’m professional, a professional loves recording. There’s a lot more I could jump into. I’ll tell you what. I’ll give one that is expensive, but the best of breed, which is the TANK M3 push sled. This is a sled. It’s literally sitting right outside my door, about 100 feet away. I have tried so many different sleds for resolving back pain, for building all posterior chain development and strength, glute activation, you name it. Pushing and pulling a sled just gives you so many dividends. KneesOverToesGuy also talks about this at length, but the TANK M3 push sled is — Kevin Rose: Holy shit, it’s pricey. Tim Ferriss: — bar none the best sled I’ve ever used. Yeah. How much is it? Did you just pull it up? Kevin Rose: 1,500 on Amazon. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 1,500. Yeah, 1,500 bucks. I would not — Kevin Rose: It looks amazing though. Tim Ferriss: I would not trade it. You can easily rotate it. It has mechanical resistance. For instance, I’m pushing it in a gravel driveway. It’s not just skids. You can use this on turf, you can use this on carpets, you can use it indoors without destroying the floor. It’s just an amazing sled. If people are looking for best of the best, in my opinion, and versatility, that’s one. And then if you don’t want more stuff or you want to give something to friends or family who don’t need more physical things — I am talking my book a little bit here because I’m involved with the company, but The Way App. It’s so easy, right? Kevin Rose: Henry’s the best, man. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to be doing hopefully another retreat in-person together. It started out as just my hand-down favorite meditation app. It’s the easiest way to get back in the habit. I just used it yesterday morning and this morning. I tend to do 10-minute sessions and then sometimes do an extra 10 minutes of TM or something after the fact. I think you can get 30 sessions for free with no credit card required — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — to try it out. And then if you want to give an annual membership, that’s 100 bucks. You can just download the app for free and then tap My Way and share it with people that way with a gift button. Kevin Rose: I’ll definitely add onto that. And I’ll say that I met Henry, the creator of The Way App, and he’s one of the very few Zen masters that are fully accredited in the United States. It is such a treat to interact with and have Henry as a guide and you get a pocket Zen master. I don’t want to sell this, but I will say that in the last — I started training with him in terms of meeting with him over Zoom during COVID, and now it’s been a few years, there is no better money spent in terms of — for me it has been more of retreats and things like that that I’ve been to of his. But meditation in terms of my just general anxiety and general way of moving through life, it’s been a game changer. It’s been a game changer. And Henry, I will give him a ton of credit there. One of the things that he told me early on, it still hits me today, is, “It’s not about, ‘Can I put in an hour a day of meditation?’ It’s better to put in just 10 minutes a day or five minutes a day and do it consistently than it is to try and achieve the mountaintop and go all out.” Can you just show up consistently? And I think if you do it for the first 30 days, you’ll feel it. You’ll feel it. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you’ll notice something much earlier, in my experience. Henry has this expression, I’m going to paraphrase it, but basically if you do the practice, even if in some sessions you’re like, my mind is all over the place, I feel like that was a waste of time, “If you walk consistently in the fog, you can’t help but get wet.” is one of his expressions, meaning it compounds over time and even if you feel like individual sessions aren’t doing much, it does actually compound. If people want to keep it simple, you can find a QR code at thewayapp.com/tim and that’ll give you 30 free sessions with no credit card, so people can check that out if they want. What else do we have, Kevin? You have — Kevin Rose: I’ve got one more that’s fun. It is on the slightly pricier side. It’s a little over $200, close to $300. Actually, it’s a walking treadmill. My wife, Darya, turned me onto this. It is a very thin, tiny, little walking treadmill that has phenomenal reviews. You just throw it underneath your desk and for under $300 you can set the incline to 10 and it’s all with a little, tiny remote control. There’s nothing to hold onto, because you have your desk. You can just work and it rolls away because it only weighs 50 pounds, and you can just stash it in the corner. I think it’s the best walking treadmill. We did a bunch of research and it’s the best one under $300. Great way to get some exercise in there. Throw on a weighted vest there and you’re in a really good place. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah, that’ll be plenty. I saw that when Darya was showing me her office. I was like, oh, look at that. There it is. Kevin Rose: That’s right. You got the tour. I wasn’t even home and you came over and stole my sleeping meds and — Tim Ferriss: Snagged your Belsomra — Kevin Rose: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: — took a spin on the walking treadmill and then took off. Yeah, I still owe you a trade for that. I do see in your notes, do you want to take a second and run people through Kevin’s current AI stack? This is all Greek to me, I don’t even understand what half of this means. Kevin Rose: Okay, real quick. I don’t know if you want to touch on New Year’s resolutions really fast — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s do it after the AI stack. Kevin Rose: AI Stack, one of the things that I’ve noticed is becoming more and more ubiquitous in the space is this idea of an AI assistant that is not your phone, but something that you can call when you need to remember something, when you need to take notes, when you — Tim, I was wearing that little pendant when you and I got together. Tim Ferriss: Hate it, hate it. Kevin Rose: It’s always recording, and Tim goes to me, he is like, “It’s always recording?” I was like, “Yeah.” And he goes, “I hate to ask you this, but can you just take it off? It’s too much anxiety for me.” So I had to take off that pendant and put it in my bag. But I agree with you, in that it is weird. It does cripple our conversations in our honesty when you know there’s something that’s listening all the time, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100 percent. Kevin Rose: A couple things, Nothing, the Android phone company, I’m not an investor or anything like that, they make headphones, which I’m wearing right now for this podcast. But one of the things that was really cool, when they released these headphones a month ago, they have a little talk button on the headphones. If you hold down talk as you’re holding your headphones case, I can record anything and it goes into their AI and it creates to-do lists for me, notes — Tim Ferriss: That’s cool. Kevin Rose: — whatever it may be. Tim Ferriss: That’s a cool feature. Kevin Rose: It’s just fun. Yeah. There was a company called Sandbar and we invested. True, it wasn’t my deal. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. Do you need to have an Android phone to use those? Kevin Rose: Yes, you need to have a Nothing phone. Tim Ferriss: Bummer. Kevin Rose: That’s the problem. But the idea is sound in that it’s not always on, it’s just when you need it, right? Tim Ferriss: Yep, yep. Kevin Rose: One of the things that Sandbar did, and I have one of their prototype rings around here somewhere. One of the things that Sandbar did is they created a ring, almost like an Oura ring, where if you just lightly touch it, you can whisper to any notes that you might want and it saves it in the AI cloud on your phone, Android OS, whatever. If you have headphones in, it’ll respond back to you. So like, “Hey. Remind me, what’s that meeting I have tomorrow?” just quietly. It doesn’t listen to the entire room, and then it gives you that data back in your headphones. Anyway. Sandbar is not out yet. It’s coming out middle of next year. I highly recommend sandbar.com, checking out. Like I said, it is something that we invest in at the fund level, but it’s not my deal. But I will say, I like where this is going. Even if it’s not Sandbar, something like this that is a little companion, that is not your big ass phone, that can be engaged with when you want to jot something down is quite cool. Outside of that, I would say AI on the Notion front has been quite good. The agents that they’ve added inside of Notion are phenomenal and that continues to get better. Tim Ferriss: What do you use that for? How do you use that? Kevin Rose: Notion, just added note-taking now. If you’re in a Zoom or any type of video call, it will automatically prompt you to record the entire thing. By default, I always say to people, Notion’s not actually recording the audio, but they are transcribing it, and they put the meeting notes and the bullet points into my Notion for me, and then I can ask questions of that transcript later on. Call it a week or two later, I’m like, “Hey, Tim mentioned some really cool book by Anthony de Mello, which one was it?” and it would, boom, right there, it’s within two seconds. That’s really cool. And then you can ask questions of your entire corpus of data. So, if you’re storing a bunch of stuff in there — I had my EIN number for one of my LCs and I’d be like, “Hey, what’s the EIN number for this LC?” Two seconds later, it’s out. That’s fun. Tim Ferriss: When do you think Gemini built into G Suite will be good enough to do that for an inbox? Kevin Rose: It is now. It is now. Tim Ferriss: Is it? Kevin Rose: Yeah, it is. Tim Ferriss: Because it was so disappointing as of even a few weeks ago. Kevin Rose: I just enabled it, this deeper integration. I don’t know if I’m a beta tester, but they let me in, and it does exactly what I just said. It’s within the coming weeks if I’ve happened to be on some beta list and whatever. Who will do this right now is actually the Gemini — oh, what are they calling it? It’s their AI suite where you can drop documents into it and everything. Everyone’s screaming it right at me. You know what I’m talking about, right? Have you played with this? Tim Ferriss: No, no. Oh, wait, are you talking about NotebookLM? No. Kevin Rose: Yeah, NotebookLM. Yeah, NotebookLM is getting better and better. Here’s a fun hack. This is a great one for your audience because they like your productivity, everything. One thing that’s really fun is, imagine there’s something you want to learn that’s new. Insert anything. You want to learn how to do basic Pilates. Go to ChatGPT or Gemini or whatever else and say, “Hey, give me a deep research guide on the fundamentals of Pilates,” and then you hit go. You wait five minutes, whatever, it gives you back a whole script. You copy that, paste it into NotebookLM, and say, “Create me a five-minute podcast on the fundamentals of Pilates,” and you have an instant podcast primer on that thing. I use that for coding technologies. I’ve used that for quantum computing. Tim, do you know how quantum computing works? Do you know how gates fold on each other when — Tim Ferriss: No. Kevin Rose: I didn’t. I dropped that in there and then you say, “Explain it like I’m five in a podcast.” Or not five, but you’d say, “Explain it like I’m a — Tim Ferriss: Fifth grader. Kevin Rose: — freshman in college.” Yeah, like I’m a fifth grader, whatever. I have aphantasia and I have no way to recall this later. It gives you this great, little podcast and it’s a fun, little way to learn anything new on the go. Tim Ferriss: I have to give a plug, and I am an investor in this company. It came up in a group thread. I don’t think he would mind me mentioning this. Our mutual friend, Chris Sacca, was like, “My daughter just taught herself about stock trading,” and this, this, and this. He took a screenshot and he’s like, “She created her own curriculum,” and — It was from a startup called Oboe. If people go to Oboe, that’s O-B-O-E.fyi, so oboe.fyi, it just says, “What do you want to learn about? We’ll make you a course.” You literally just type it out and it gives you everything in one place. Kevin Rose: Are you an investor in this? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m an investor. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: I noticed you had mentioned before — what was it? This would be fun for 30 seconds. When you were pitched this, because you were very — you say no to a lot of things, which is great, as every — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: — investor should. What was it about this that really hooked you in? Tim Ferriss: There were a few things. It was the people involved. I had some familiarity with the people involved and I had confidence in their ability to execute. Also, this is what I do, right? In the sense that if I have tried to hone any single skill, it is deconstructing and simplifying complex subjects, then putting material in some type of logical sequence, doing 80/20 analysis on the 20 percent of material that makes the difference, and the material beats method a lot of the time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I’ve thought a lot about this and I was like, all right, the thesis and mission of the company makes a lot of sense to me. Will they be the winner? I have no idea. That is a much harder question. That informs bet sizing and things along those lines. But I have a lot of confidence in the founders. The company itself was introduced to me, or the founding team behind it, by another founder who’s had exits, who is an investor, who’s a friend of mine. And I thought to myself, even if this just goes towards creating a product that I, myself will use — which is really where I start with a lot of my investing. Sometimes I succeed when I stray from that, but my hit rate is a lot higher when — say, in the case of Uber or Shopify or any of these other — Kevin Rose: Yes, it’s a core competence of yours. Tim Ferriss: Duolingo, these are — I know at least I am a market of one — Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: — for all of these products, and Oboe would fall in that category. That’s how I decided to invest. With these companies, it’s also not a bet-the-farm scenario, at least not for me. It’s you’re creating a portfolio with the recognition that 70, 80 percent of your investments are going to go to zero. But I try to answer the question, how can I win even if this goes to zero? How can I win? It’s if I help to in some way support a product and the development of a product that I use myself to learn a bunch of stuff quickly, then given the leverage that I think I can create or find in the world, it’s like, wow. If I have a smooth way, an elegant way to learn more about a few different — I’ll give you an example. If I’m considering, and I’ve already done this, if I’m doing due diligence on a company that I can’t talk about right now, but it’s innovating in biotech, and I want to learn as much as possible about different types of mRNA therapeutics, I’m not coming from a background that enables me to do that. If I then am able to do due diligence a hundred times faster because I’m not sending out 15 emails to people I think might be able to assist, and I’d still do that level of due diligence, but if let’s just say that 50 K investment allows me to then do due diligence in a way that allows me to place two or three other bets more effectively, I’ve very likely made my money back. Whether it’s with investing or choosing projects like the card game, Coyote, or anything else, my fundamental, underlying question is: Can this be a win even if it fails with, let’s just say, the primary external metric of sales or exit or whatever it might be? If I’m developing skills and relationships that snowball and transcend any single project, then that’s a vote in favor of doing something. oboe.fyi would fit into that bucket for me. It made me so happy to see Sacca’s daughter when she’s whatever, 12 or 13, creating her own course. I was like, okay, that’s a good sign that makes me happy. Kevin Rose: I just clicked on one of the things to create a course for me. It’s pretty cool because right away it said, “Do you want this in podcast format, which is seven minutes?” or, “Do you want this in lectured recording, which is 20 minutes?” Tim Ferriss: That’s awesome. Kevin Rose: That’s built into the product from step one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, from step one. And like you said, this is the blocky, brick, Motorola version. The rate of iteration for something like this is going to be so extreme, it’s going to be head spinning, so we’ll see. Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: I’m excited about it. Kevin Rose: All right, the moment you all have been waiting for, Tim’s girlfriend. Tim Ferriss: Thought I — Kevin Rose: Come on, dude. Tim Ferriss: Thought I got out of — Kevin Rose: No, no, no. People are — Tim Ferriss: I — Kevin Rose: They want to know what’s up with Tim’s personal life. Tim Ferriss: I’m not going to dox anyone who doesn’t opt into being doxed, so I’ll skip any identifying particulars. It’s getting serious quickly. She’s incredibly — Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: — sweet, incredibly self-aware, intelligent. For people who are wondering, of all places, met on Hinge. Have to kiss a lot of frogs or go on a lot of dates, it’s a lot of reps, a lot of swiping and a lot of noise to get to that point. But it did work. Kevin Rose: What was the first date like? Tim Ferriss: First date was Greek food, very chill, felt very much — I pay a lot of attention to this. You know that I have a very sensitive nervous system, and I just immediately felt down-regulated and at ease with her. That’s a lot. That’s not a small thing for me. Keeps me on my toes, is very funny, is very good at calling me on my bullshit. I’m optimistic. We’ll see. We’ll see. Super, super happy. Doing Thanksgiving together and — Kevin Rose: Oh, wow. Family introduction time and all that shit? Tim Ferriss: Oh, she met my family already quite a while ago. It’s — Kevin Rose: I’ve only met her once. One final question then I’ll let you out the hot box. What is the hardest thing for you at this stage? Because you get to this point where there’s this honeymoon phase and then all of a sudden that starts to peel off and it’s in the nitty-gritty of life. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: What’s the hardest, most challenging part about this next, call it, six months? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know if I have the ability to predict, but my guess would be — I think what I’m about to describe is a plight of modern dating in general, at least as I’ve seen it among my friends and pretty much anyone who I’ve ever spoken to about this or if I ever mention modern datings in the app-based dating world. It’s such a game of roulette. The apps are designed to be as addictive as possible. I think the challenge for almost anyone who has been part of that playing field is when things get hard, when things are hard, when you have friction that lasts more than a day or a week, to stay the course and do the work necessary to resolve that as opposed to just being like, ah, fuck this, I’m just going to go back to the well. Kevin Rose: Because the well’s right there. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: It’s 20 seconds away and a swipe away, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: That’s the downfall of these whole things. It’s so easy to move on to the next thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. They are all designed to be, of course, as addictive as possible. And even though they might say they’re designed to be deleted, by definition, since they have a fiduciary responsibility, a legal fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders, their business model is entirely dependent on recurring revenue. So, they’re designed to keep you using the app as long as humanly possible. I don’t blame them for that. That’s just the way that this ecosystem works. But it is something to be aware of because they are seductive and they’re designed to be seductive, these apps, in every way conceivable. I would say that, step number one, take that stuff off your phone. And then number two is, fortunately I feel like over my last few long relationships — I’ve had some very long relationships. Five, six years in two cases — that I’ve developed a toolkit. I can always use more work and more refinement, but it’s like, do you have the basics of something approximating Nonviolent Communication? Do you ask for what you want and do you tell someone if they’re doing something that you don’t want? These seem like very obvious, self-evident things you should do, but a lot of people struggle with both of those, and then that breeds resentment or people bottle things up and then they explode and they say things they can’t take back. To what extent have you tried to mitigate those things? Do you have a toolkit? There are very good books out there, very good workshops. I’ve read a lot of these books and I’ve gone to a lot of workshops. As much as I’ve felt like I wanted to poke my eyes out with bicycle spokes at points in these workshops and seminars because I can only take so much of it — Kevin Rose: Same. Tim Ferriss: — they do help though. It could be something really small. And there are things you learn along the way, at least I have, as you get older, which is you can have almost anything you want in life if you discuss it openly and early. If you have weaknesses, if you have requests, if you have needs, if you have things that you value that are maybe weirdly out of proportion to most people, just talking about that stuff early sets the stage for success or at least communication. Very early on in this relationship, having conversations about conversations, if that makes sense, having open communication about how we’d like to communicate the challenges we have with communication. How we’re going to communicate, biasing towards honesty and being direct, even if you need to do a little bit of cleanup afterwards, has just saved a lot of brand damage. In this case, I think we both have very growth-oriented mindsets. I think both of us are pretty good at taking feedback. There are times when you’re just too sleep deprived or pissed off or bitchy or irritable, and you’re not good at taking feedback. You’re always going to have those days. But overall, I think we’re both eager to improve and we’re good at giving feedback in a way that generally doesn’t come off as too holier than now, judgmental. We’ll see, we’ll see. But in terms of the challenges, I think the challenges are always — I shouldn’t say always, that’s a big word. Man, so much of it just comes down to communication. Do you have the tools? Have you, say, read or listened to Terry Real? Have you both listened or read Terry Real so that you have some scripts or some shared language that you can use as shorthand? And — Kevin Rose: The problem I have with Terry Real is that if it’s taken too literally, it can sound formulaic. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kevin Rose: I don’t want to do the formula, let’s just talk, it can be a bit — Tim Ferriss: Here’s what I would say about that. I’d say that almost anything that works repeatedly is a formula. In the beginning, I think it’s important, as rote as it might seem, to — let’s just say the book, Nonviolent Communication, I think it’s Marshall Rosenberg, it’s a great book, but after a while you’re like, oh, my God, am I really going to say again, “When you did X, as a video camera would’ve recorded it, I felt Y. And the story I make up is X.” Kevin Rose: That stuff. “The story I make up…” kills me. Tim Ferriss: But here’s the thing. I know it kills you and — Kevin Rose: Stop saying, “The story I make up…” Tim Ferriss: But here’s the thing. As much as you might hate it, what you would hate more is, “Kevin, I fucking hate when you do X. It makes me feel Y, because you always do Z.” That’s worse, I think, right? You might be like — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — ah, with the formula, but the amount of damage you can do when you veer completely away from it is a lot. And then once you have the, I’d say, basic mastery or fluency with the formula, then you can deviate, right? Kevin Rose: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: Then you can start to deviate. But for instance, Terry, as any couples therapist, has certain frameworks and formulas. But there are also underlying philosophical principles that I think apply to a million different things that are outside of formulas. I’ll give you an example. One thing that Terry says — I think this is in Fierce Intimacy, which is an audio book, you can’t find a print version of it. I highly recommend it to folks. The point he makes is — it’s real simple — objective reality has no place in a relationship. What the hell does that mean? What that means is if you’re out at dinner and then the waiter comes over and the wife orders and then the waiter walks away and the husband’s like, “Honey, you don’t need to yell at him,” and she’s like, “I wasn’t yelling,” and then it turns into a whole bullshit argument about whether she was yelling or not. If the husband were to say, “Honey, actually I hired a professional audiologist with the latest cutting-edge technology and recording equipment, and they’re sitting right at the table next to us. If we accept the commonly defined threshold for yelling at XYZ decimals, if you look at these numbers, you can see that in fact you were, by scientific definition, yelling,” is that going to fix the problem? No, it’s going to be a huge fucking mess, right? Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: His point is the stories matter and the subjective matters and very — shorthand for that is objective — he may not word it exactly this way, but objective reality just doesn’t have a place in, let’s just say, an argument. We’re going to make mistakes. Occasionally, especially someone like me is going to try to appeal to some objective measure of God knows what. But if you can just postpone that judgment even for a minute or two, it just makes a world of difference, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Maybe it makes me sound like I’m really remedial in the EQ communication department. I actually don’t think that’s true. I think I’m pretty good. It’s like going to the gym, it’s like playing pool or shooting archery or whatever, it’s not a one-and-done thing, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you don’t practice these things, you will revert to whatever your parents did. Period. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And I don’t want to model that. That was a goddamn mess. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I found that if my partner gets upset, just sitting down and saying, “Calm down.” is huge. Tim Ferriss: That works — Kevin Rose: It just works every time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Kevin Rose: Or, “You’re being like your mother.” Those are things that are just really just home runs. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. “Why are you so hysterical like your mother?” Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Works like a charm. I think that’s Terry Real’s second principle. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Just say “calm down” and then you’re good, you’re good. They’ll be like, “Oh, I was being so crazy. You’re right. I should just calm down.” Tim Ferriss: I think also just expecting there to be bumps. There are always going to be bumps and — we’ll see, we’ll see. But — Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s been great so far. I feel super, super lucky, really, really fortunate. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I mean, you only date supermodels, so you should feel lucky. Tim Ferriss: That’s not true. That’s not true. Kevin Rose: I’ve met her. You have a supermodel on your hands. She’s great. Tim Ferriss: She’s very pretty, but she’s also very, very smart, knows how to adult, knows how to take care of things in the world. Which isn’t asking too much, but it’s surprising how many aspiring stay-at-home girlfriends you can find out there who have no intention of operating in the world. I feel very, very lucky, super, super fortunate. Kevin Rose: I’m excited for you, dude. Tim Ferriss: Yeah — Kevin Rose: Can we just spend some more time with her? Our first interactions were great. I’m excited to get to know her better. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, she’s incredibly kind, not a malicious bone in her body, but at the same time, hilariously blunt in some cases and sometimes not so hilariously blunt, but I’ll take it. It’s a package deal, I’ll take it. Kevin Rose: You’ve got a bit of that too though, right? So, it’s like — Tim Ferriss: I’ve got some of that. Yeah, I do too. I’ve got some of that, for sure. Kevin Rose: I’ve known enough of your ex-girlfriends to know that you’ve got a little bit of that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’ve got a little bit of that. It’s true. Oh, man. I think I’ve probably checked the box of talking about the girlfriend. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Awesome. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to have dinner very shortly. Happy Thanksgiving, man. Kevin Rose: Yeah, happy Thanksgiving. I would say the only thing on my side, just to bring people to speed on, is I have a new tech podcast that I’m very excited about that I’m going to launch in the new year. Kevinrose.com for my 4-Bullet Friday, which is a much faster read. No, I don’t — I only put out one email every month and a half or every — but it’s always packed with the latest AI stuff I’m playing with, all that stuff. Anyway. That’s my only plug of the show, is kevinrose.com, for the newsletter. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, check it out. Check it out, folks. We’ll hit New Year’s resolutions and stuff next time we do a Random Show. Let’s do it. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We’ll do that, because I need to dust mine off and blow the film that has settled on those and look at them in higher resolution, so I could use a little extra time. And we’ll — Kevin Rose: Love it. Tim Ferriss: We’ll get after it. Kevin Rose: Love you, brother. Always good to see you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, love you too, bud. Kevin Rose: And thanks for sharing more of the personal side with us. Everybody gets a kick out of that and it’s always fun to hear your adventures. But I’m excited for you marching forward and I have good vibes about this one. Tim Ferriss: Thanks, man. It’s a fucking jungle out there. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Modern dating, it is simultaneously so fun if you hit your groove in a playing-the-field kind of way, but it’s also so incredibly exhausting and frustrating and can be very demoralizing. And — Kevin Rose: I don’t feel bad for you, honestly. I’ve gotten some of your texts. I think you had a damn good run. You had a good run. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m not complaining. I’m just saying I feel most at home, at ease, at peace when I am with my current girlfriend. It’s qualitatively a world of difference from just running around like some horny bastard with his hair on fire. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but — Kevin Rose: Not that there’s any hair left, but yeah. Tim Ferriss: Not that there’s any hair left. And also just be aware, whether you’re on X or Instagram, but especially on the dating apps because it is selling sex and things that are hardwired to hijack your attention, your faculties are being exploited to the maximum degree possible. It’s just something to be aware of. Really check your state before and after using these things to determine how much you might want to use them or if you want to put safeguards around how long you spend on these things. All right. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Kevin Rose: Love it. Tim Ferriss: Cool, brother. Love you very much. Please give a hug to Darya and the girls for me. Kevin Rose: Will do. Tim Ferriss: And — Kevin Rose: Same on my side. How’s Molly doing? Molly’s good? Tim Ferriss: Molly’s great. Yeah, Molly’s doing great. And — Kevin Rose: How old is Molly now? Tim Ferriss: Molly’s 10. I’m actually going to adopt a — Kevin Rose: Ah. Tim Ferriss: — puppy. I’m going to get a second dog next month. Super excited. Kevin Rose: Toaster’s 15 now. You saw him when you came to the house. Tim Ferriss: I did. Kevin Rose: I wasn’t there when you were there. Tim Ferriss: Oh. Kevin Rose: Isn’t he moving slower? It’s hard to watch. Tim Ferriss: He was. He also had just come from the vet and his paw was all taped up and he was — Kevin Rose: Oh, geez. Tim Ferriss: — drugged out of his mind — Kevin Rose: I know. Tim Ferriss: — when I saw him. Yeah, 15, he’s getting up there. Kevin Rose: I know. We gave him rapa, so I’m hoping for — I mean, we’ve already seen a 20 percent boost in lifespan, so we’ll see. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I need to get Molly on rapa. That’s going to be one of my tasks for December as well. One step at a time. Kevin Rose: Awesome. All right, brother. Tim Ferriss: All right, brother. Great to see you, bud. Kevin Rose: Great to see you. Tim Ferriss: Everybody listening, you can go to the show notes. We’ll have links to everything at tim.blog/podcast. Random Show, just look for the newest one and we’ll have it for you. Happy holidays, everybody. Thanks for tuning in. Kevin Rose: Happy holidays. Tim Ferriss: I’ll see you soon, Kevin.

Title: One Tech Tip: Up your Christmas shopping game with AI tools

AI-powered shopping assistants have become a staple in online retail, making shopping easier and more convenient Shopping assistant chatbots were a novelty a year ago. Now, they’re everywhere. After rolling out AI-powered assistants, online retailers and tech companies have been adding more artificial intelligence features to make online shopping easier and more convenient. The latest crop of AI-powered shopping services and tools made their debut in recent weeks, just in time to kick off the holiday shopping season that begins with Black Friday. Here’s a rundown of existing and newly released AI services that can help with your search for the perfect gift in the run-up to Christmas: Amazon led the way by rolling out its Rufus chatbot in 2024. Other ecommerce websites followed with their own AI assistants to enhance the online shopping experience. Walmart's Sparky chatbot is available on the retail giant’s app and can synthesize reviews or offer product recommendations based on occasions, such as Christmas. Target recently unveiled a gift finder chatbot on its app, but it's only available for the holiday season. Ralph Lauren partnered with Microsoft on the “Ask Ralph” chatbot to provide style recommendations. The aim of deploying chatbots is to make it easier for people to find what they’re looking for. Instead of entering search terms and keywords, you can type or use voice dictation for a conversational back-and-forth. The results, in my experience, can be mixed. I tried Rufus recently to find a replacement aftermarket stainless steel pot for my rice cooker, as well as a protective trivet for my kitchen sink faucet. In both cases, the results weren’t quite right and didn’t seem to capture the wide range of products available. Sometimes the results were completely unsuitable. I ended up doing a more painstaking search of product listings’ pictures and specifications to find the right items. The problem, I suspect, is partly because I was looking for generic products. Searches for name-brand products may produce better results. Perhaps you don’t want to limit yourself to a single retailer’s website in your Christmas shopping search. Or you’re not sure where exactly to find that perfect gift. Tech platforms have rolled out AI-powered shopping tools that can cast a wider net by searching multiple sites. OpenAI added a new “shopping research” feature to ChatGPT last week that can provide personalized buying advice for products that are heavy on detailed specs, like electronics or appliances. The feature will activate if you ask ChatGPT a shopping-related question or manually turn it on in the chat window. OpenAI says it can go beyond simple questions, such as checking a price or feature that regular ChatGPT can easily answer. Google users can get a similar experience when they use its search engine in AI Mode, which recently got a big update for shopping searches. The company says users can describe what they’re looking for as if talking to a friend and get an “intelligently organized response” based on 50 billion product listings, with pictures alongside prices, reviews and inventory info. Google added similar shopping features to its Gemini AI chatbot app for U.S. users last month. Meanwhile, Perplexity unveiled its own shopping assistant feature last week that can tailor recommendations based on previous searches. I asked all three to find a soft cotton flannel shirt. Both ChatGPT and Perplexity asked me for specific requirements, such as budget and must-have features. ChatGPT's response was the most detailed, with options from six brands including its top pick, and included pictures, prices and point-form summaries for each shirt. It also compiled the results into a comparison table. Results from Google, which didn't ask follow up questions after my initial request, felt the most general. Perplexity's results fell in between. So, you think you've found a stylish cardigan for your spouse. But you're not sure about the silhouette or vibe. Generative AI “try on” tools let users see what a piece of clothing might look like on the wearer. Existing virtual dressing room tools have relied on complex 3D rendering, real photoshoots and augmented reality. Often, shoppers were limited to picking a model that best fit their body type to see how clothes fit. Google is now tapping AI to allow shoppers to virtually try on garments and shoes using pictures of themselves in simple poses. Among the exceptions: accessories like hats or jewelry, bathing suits and lingerie. To use this feature, which is available through Google's shopping desktop search and mobile app in Australia, Japan Canada and the U.S., just tap the “Try it on” button on a product's photo and then add a full-length photo of yourself. You can then save the image of yourself with the tested item or share it. The original photo is also saved to your account so you don't need to keep uploading fresh images. If you're shopping for a gift for someone, Google says you can upload their photo, but only if you have their permission. Now that you've figured out what exactly to get for those special people on your Christmas gift list, it's time to buy. But if you want to outsource some of the legwork involved, there are “agentic AI” tools that can help. Amazon users can use an “AI agent” to buy a product on their behalf if the price falls to a desired level. Google has launched its own “agentic checkout” feature, which can automatically buy a product you're keeping an eye on with its price-tracking feature. Google's feature has rolled out to a small group of retailers, including Wayfair, Chewy and Quince we well as some Shopify merchants. Both companies say they'll always confirm with you before the AI agent makes the purchase. Amazon is taking it a step further by allowing shoppers to buy items that aren’t in stock directly from other brands’ websites. If you see a product on the Amazon Shopping app with a “Buy For Me” button, you can buy it through the usual Amazon checkout page but the AI agent will then carry out the transaction on the other brand’s website with your encrypted payment details. The feature was in test mode but is being rolled out more widely. Prefer to buy in person? It's a good idea to make sure a bricks-and-mortar shop has the product you want before heading over. Google has launched an AI service that will call local stores to ask. It's only available in the U.S. for toys, electronics and health and beauty products. When doing a Google search for the product you want, add “near me” to the end of your search query. Then, if you see “Let Google Call” when scrolling through the results, you can tap the “Get started” button. Answer some questions about what you’re shopping for, whether you want updates by email or text. Google will then contact stores near your location to ask if the item is in stock. The bot works swiftly but results might be limited. When an AP reporter in New Jersey asked Google to call around about a specific Acer monitor, the agent returned quickly with a reply from a local computer repair shop that sold refurbished monitors. It appeared to ignore nearby big-box outlets selling electronics. According to Google's text update, the local repair shop didn't have the monitor, but did have a similar-sized one — sans the other bells and whistles — for a lower price. ___ Is there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

AI Stat Padding Google and Meta love bragging about how widely their AI tools are being used by consumers. But are those metrics legit? For example, Mark Zuckerberg noted during Meta’s quarterly earnings in October that “more than one billion monthly actives already use Meta AI.” Wow! Sounds like a lot. Usage has also increased, Zuckerberg added, as the underlying models improve. But guess what? The basic search function on Instagram was recently replaced by Meta AI, and the app’s entire user base now defaults to that experience even if someone doesn’t want to use the feature. Meanwhile, Google is funneling people to its AI Mode for search regardless of their search engine preferences. As noted by Search Engine Roundtable, anyone who uploads a photo or document to Google is now sent to AI Mode by default instead of a traditional Google Search or Image Search. Meanwhile, in September, Google quietly began sliding a button into the Chrome URL address bar that directs queries straight into AI Mode rather than traditional search. The Defrayed Desk It’s been knives out for The Trade Desk’s 20% take rate all year. And now the largest independent DSP actually appears open to cutting its own fees. Although The Trade Desk historically has been inflexible in pricing negotiations, it’s offering agency discounts and incentives this Q4, Digiday reports. What’s changed? Mainly, increased competition from other top DSPs, Amazon in particular. Amazon DSP has been courting agencies with 0% tech fees for Amazon-owned media and 1% fees for third-party ads. Plus, TTD is under pressure to meet or exceed expectations this Q4, after missing its fourth quarter 2024 revenue guidance earlier this year. One indie agency buyer says TTD offered 1% to 2% discounts on ad tech fees for individual clients – if the agency committed to spending $500,000 more in Q4 than originally budgeted. Another buyer says they were offered post-auction discounts if they spent at least $750,000 in Q4. At the holding company level, one buyer says, TTD is making its development team available for working on tailored programmatic solutions free of charge. Another observes that TTD’s account reps are more responsive lately. All told, evidence is accumulating of an increasingly cutthroat DSP market. Open Up The Elsagates Good news: YouTube has finally found a reliable audience for the AI-generated content that’s been flooding the platform. Bad news: It’s toddlers (again). YouTube creators are increasingly monetizing by generating generic, low-quality AI slop videos intended for children, reports Bloomberg. The trend is particularly popular among entrepreneur-focused creators that make content about making money on YouTube, such as Monique Hinton and Isabella Kotsias. Both have posted videos specifically advocating that their viewers attempt to copy popular YouTube Kids trends and products, like “Baby Shark” and “Cocomelon.” This might trigger alarm bells for those who remember 2017’s Elsagate, a YouTube epoch marked by nonsensical videos of popular children’s characters (mostly Spider-Man and Elsa from “Frozen”) engaging in strange or disturbing activities. This “luridly-colored vomit,” as Forbes called it at the time, became enough of a problem that YouTube changed its community guidelines, purged thousands of videos and removed monetizable ads from millions more. Although, some might argue that these content farms didn’t disappear so much as move into new genres. But Wait! There’s More Let’s get real about agentic AI.

Title: Axon Tests Face Recognition on Body-Worn Cameras

Time Published: 2025-12-03T23:51:11Z
Full Content:
Axon Enterprise Inc. is working with a Canadian police department to test the addition of face recognition technology (FRT) to its body-worn cameras (BWCs). This is an alarming development in government surveillance that should put communities everywhere on alert. As many as 50 officers from the Edmonton Police Department (EPD) will begin using these FRT-enabled BWCs today as part of a proof-of-concept experiment. EPD is the first police department in the world to use these Axon devices, according to a report from the Edmonton Journal. This kind of technology could give officers instant identification of any person that crosses their path. During the current trial period, the Edmonton officers will not be notified in the field of an individual’s identity but will review identifications generated by the BWCs later on. “This Proof of Concept will test the technology’s ability to work with our database to make officers aware of individuals with safety flags and cautions from previous interactions,” as well as “individuals who have outstanding warrants for serious crime,” Edmonton Police described in a press release, suggesting that individuals will be placed on a watchlist of sorts. FRT brings a rash of problems. It relies on extensive surveillance and collecting images on individuals, law-abiding or otherwise. Misidentifications can cause horrendous consequences for individuals, including prolonged and difficult fights for innocence and unfair incarceration for crimes never committed. In a world where police are using real-time face recognition, law-abiding individuals or those participating in legal, protected activity that police may find objectionable — like protest — could be quickly identified. With the increasing connections being made between disparate data sources about nearly every person, BWCs enabled with FRT can easily connect a person minding their own business, who happens to come within view of a police officer, with a whole slew of other personal information. Axon had previously claimed it would pause the addition of face recognition to its tools due to concerns raised in 2019 by the company’s AI and Policing Technology Ethics Board. However, since then, the company has continued to research and consider the addition of FRT to its products. This BWC-FRT integration signals possible other FRT integrations in the future. Axon is building an entire arsenal of cameras and surveillance devices for law enforcement, and the company grows the reach of its police surveillance apparatus, in part, by leveraging relationships with its thousands of customers, including those using its flagship product, the Taser. This so-called “ecosystem” of surveillance technologyq includes the Fusus system, a platform for connecting surveillance cameras to facilitate real-time viewing of video footage. It also involves expanding the use of surveillance tools like BWCs and the flying cameras of “drone as first responder” (DFR) programs. Face recognition undermines individual privacy, and it is too dangerous when deployed by police. Communities everywhere must move to protect themselves and safeguard their civil liberties, insisting on transparency, clear policies, public accountability, and audit mechanisms. Ideally, communities should ban police use of the technology altogether. At a minimum, police must not add FRT to BWCs. This post was written by EFF legal intern Alexa Chavara.Black box technology has no place in the criminal legal system.

December 03, 2025 17:29 ET | Source: Orezone Gold Corporation Orezone Gold Corporation VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE | ASX: ORE | OTCQX: ORZCF) (the “Company” or “Orezone”) is pleased to report shallow, high-grade confirmatory grade control drill results from the P17 Zone at its flagship Bomboré Gold Mine. The P17 Zone is a high-grade hard rock deposit outcropping at surface located at the southern end of the Bomboré mining lease. In addition to several phased oxide pits, which have locally been advanced into the hard rock, the P17 Zone will be a primary mill feed source in 2026 for the new hard rock plant, currently being commissioned. Selected Drill Highlights1: Patrick Downey, President and CEO stated, “The results of the near-surface P17 Zone grade control drill program were successful in confirming the P17 resource and reserve models. Furthermore, the results serve to underscore the high-grade nature and overall continuity of mineralization within the P17 Zone. This initial grade control drill program is centered on the first six months of planned production from the P17 Zone. Mining activities in this area of the pit are now underway, with mined ore scheduled to be fed to the mill in early 2026 once commissioning is complete. ___________________________________1. True widths of mineralization are between 75-80% of drilled lengths. Commissioning of the stage 1 hard rock plant is well advanced, with the jaw crusher now commissioned and a crushed ore stockpile established. The SAG mill is now turning, with grinding media being added and first ore through the mill expected to follow very soon. Water testing of the CIL circuit is now complete, with the tanks to be filled and fresh carbon to be added by the end of the week. Overall, commissioning activities remain on schedule, with first gold expected in the coming days. This is truly an exciting time for the Company, and I want to thank everyone involved for all their hard work and dedication. The commencement of production from the stage 1 hard rock plant represents a major milestone for Orezone, with overall gold production at Bomboré set to increase by 45% to 170,000 to 185,000oz in 2026. This will mark a significant cash flow inflection point, underscored by the Company’s solid balance sheet and record high gold prices.” Figure 1: Stage 1 Hard Rock Expansion Commissioning Figure 2: Bomboré Plan Map – Highlighting Location of P17 Grade Control Drilling and Associated Sections Figure 3: P17 Composite Long Section – Highlighting Location of Grade Control Cross Sections and Further Exploration Upside Down Plunge of US$1,740/oz Pit Shell (Looking West) Figure 4: P17 Grade Control Cross Section A-A’ (Looking North) Figure 5: P17 Grade Control Cross Section B-B’ (Looking North) Table 1: P17 Grade Control Drill Results * Mineralized intervals are reported as downhole lengths.

Grade control samples are generated from in-house and contractor-owed reverse circulation (“RC”) drill rigs using face sampling hammers. Samples were collected directly from a cone splitter attached to the rig-side cyclone at 1m intervals by Orezone employees. The samples are received at the on-site assay laboratory operated by Intertek, split to 1kg, pulverised and leached using the PAL-1000 method. The slurry sample produced is analysed using atomic absorption spectrometry (“AAS”) for gold giving a total cyanide extractable gold value. The leach residues from all samples with a leach grade greater than or equal to 0.25g/t Au were prepared by Intertek and split to 50g using RSDs. A 50g aliquot was analyzed by fire assay at Intertek Bomboré lab. Orezone employs a rigorous Quality Control Program including a minimum of 10% standards, blanks and duplicates. The composite width and grade include the final leach residue assay results for most of the drill intercepts reported.

A semiconductor maker increased its quarterly forecast, with strong bookings suggesting a recovery in several key end markets, and its shares led the S&P 500 higher. Meanwhile, two major media players came under pressure as a rival evaluated their competing buyout offers. Major U.S. equities indexes gained ground in the midweek trading session as soft private-sector payroll data increased expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut this month. The Dow jumped 0.9%, the S&P 500 added 0.3%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.2%. For more coverage from Investopedia on the day's market moves, see here. Shares of Microchip Technology (MCHP) surged 12.2%, posting the S&P 500's strongest daily performance. The maker of microcontrollers and other semiconductors raised its quarterly forecast for net sales and adjusted earnings per share, highlighting strong bookings activity and an improving backlog. Shares of fellow chipmakers ON Semiconductor (ON) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) rose 11% and 5.7%, respectively. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares added 6.9% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to "overweight" from "equal weight" and lifted its price target. Analysts pointed to growing optimism around Vertex's pipeline of kidney treatments, with data from Phase 3 clinical trials of two experimental drugs, Pove and Inaxaplin, anticipated next year. Shares of Delta Airlines (DAL) rose 3.6% after it warned that the government shutdown, which disrupted air traffic across the country, likely cost the carrier about $200 million in pre-tax profit in the current quarter. However, the company also said that demand in the current quarter is strong and is expected to remain so into next year. Shares of competitor United Airlines (UAL) rose 3.9% on Wednesday. Shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE), a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on life sciences properties, plunged 10.1% to suffer the steepest loss of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday. The move lower came after the firm's guidance for 2026 funds from operations, a key profitability metric for REITs, fell short of consensus expectations. The REIT also announced a 45% cut to its quarterly dividend. Sandisk (SNDK) shares fell 5.3%. Following massive year-to-date gains for the stock, bolstered by optimism for the memory card and data storage provider's AI opportunity, Sandisk joined the S&P 500 on Nov. 28. However, the stock has been trending lower since its debut. Shares of Paramount Skydance (PSKY) and Netflix (NFLX) fell 7.3% and 4.9%, respectively, as investors weighed their competing offers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Netflix reportedly made a mostly cash offer for the company's film and streaming assets. Paramount is reportedly exploring a contingency plan to bypass the board and take an offer directly to WBD shareholders. WBD shares edged 0.2% higher.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Tells Joe Rogan AI Race Is Real, But It Won’t Have a Clear Winner

Time Published: 2025-12-03T20:08:28Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang doesn’t think the artificial intelligence race will be decided in a single breakthrough. On The Joe Rogan Experience, Huang cast AI’s acceleration as the latest chapter in a long-running global competition for technological advantage, one that has repeatedly redrawn geopolitical lines, from World War II through the Cold War. “We’ve always been in a tech race with someone,” Huang said, likening today’s push for AI leadership to the Manhattan Project. The difference, he argued, is tempo: rather than a sudden, decisive finish line, AI will advance in waves, continuous gains that are easy to miss in the moment but obvious in hindsight. That doesn’t mean the stakes are modest, according to the CEO of one of the biggest manufacturers of the the chips AI firms need to operate. Huang said AI systems have become roughly 100 times more capable over the last two years, a rate of progress that has fueled public anxiety about autonomous weapons and machines operating beyond human moral constraints. Huang’s counterpoint: much of the momentum is flowing into functionality and safety, making systems more reliable, more useful and less error-prone, he claimed. He also defended the U.S. military’s role in AI development, suggesting that defense involvement can normalize the technology’s place in national security rather than leaving it to shadowy, unaccountable actors. Rogan pressed on a familiar set of fears: AI outpacing human judgment, and the longer-term threat that quantum computing could crack modern encryption. Huang pushed back, arguing that AI will remain “a click ahead," and that history is full of moments when society panicked over its newest inventions, only to adapt once the technology became legible and regulated. If Huang has an ideal end state, it’s not a single winner hoisting a trophy. It’s something quieter: AI becoming infrastructure, fading into the background as it powers everyday systems, from healthcare to transportation, less a conquering intelligence than a new layer of computing people stop noticing because it simply works.

Title: Everyone in Seattle Hates AI

Time Published: 2025-12-03T19:37:25Z
Full Content:
I grabbed lunch with a former Microsoft coworker I've always admired—one of those engineers who can take any idea, even a mediocre one, and immediately find the gold in it. I wanted her take on Wanderfugl 🐦, the AI-powered map I've been building full-time. I expected encouragement. At worst, overly generous feedback because she knows what I've sacrificed. Instead, she reacted to it with a level of negativity I'd never seen her direct at me before. When I finally got her to explain what was wrong, none of it had anything to do with what I built. She talked about Copilot 365. And Microsoft AI. And every miserable AI tool she's forced to use at work. My product barely featured. Her reaction wasn't about me at all. It was about her entire environment. Her PM had been laid off months earlier. The team asked why. Their director told them it was because the PM org "wasn't effective enough at using Copilot 365." I nervously laughed. This director got up in a group meeting and said that someone lost their job over this? After a pause I tried to share how much better I've been feeling—how AI tools helped me learn faster, how much they accelerated my work on Wanderfugl. I didn't fully grok how tone deaf I was being though. She's drowning in resentment. I left the lunch deflated and weirdly guilty, like building an AI product made me part of the problem. But then I realized this was bigger than one conversation. Every time I shared Wanderfugl with a Seattle engineer, I got the same reflexive, critical, negative response. This wasn't true in Bali, Tokyo, Paris, or San Francisco—people were curious, engaged, wanted to understand what I was building. But in Seattle? Instant hostility the moment they heard "AI." When I joined Microsoft, there was still a sense of possibility. Satya was pushing "growth mindset" everywhere. Leaders talked about empowerment and breaking down silos. And even though there was always a gap between the slogans and reality, there was room to try things. I leaned into it. I pushed into areas nobody wanted to touch, like Windows update compression, because it lived awkwardly across three teams. Somehow, a 40% improvement made it out alive. Leadership backed it. The people trying to kill it shrank back into their fiefdoms. It felt like the culture wanted change. That world is gone. When the layoff directive hit, every org braced for impact. Anything not strictly inside the org's charter was axed. I went from shipping a major improvement in Windows 11 to having zero projects overnight. I quit shortly after. In hindsight, getting laid off with severance might've been better than watching the culture collapse in slow motion. Then came the AI panic. If you could classify your project as "AI," you were safe and prestigious. If you couldn't, you were nobody. Overnight, most engineers got rebranded as "not AI talent." And then came the final insult: everyone was forced to use Microsoft's AI tools whether they worked or not. Copilot for Word. Copilot for PowerPoint. Copilot for email. Copilot for code. Worse than the tools they replaced. Worse than competitors' tools. Sometimes worse than doing the work manually. But you weren't allowed to fix them—that was the AI org's turf. You were supposed to use them, fail to see productivity gains, and keep quiet. Meanwhile, AI teams became a protected class. Everyone else saw comp stagnate, stock refreshers evaporate, and performance reviews tank. And if your team failed to meet expectations? Clearly you weren't "embracing AI." Bring up AI in a Seattle coffee shop now and people react like you're advocating asbestos. Amazon folks are slightly more insulated, but not by much. The old Seattle deal—Amazon treats you poorly but pays you more—only masks the rot. This belief system—that AI is useless and that you're not good enough to work on it anyway—hurts three groups: 1. The companies. They've taught their best engineers that innovation isn't their job. 2. The engineers. They're stuck in resentment and self-doubt while their careers stall. 3. Anyone trying to build anything new in Seattle. Say "AI" and people treat you like a threat or an idiot. And the loop feeds itself: Engineers don't try because they think they can't. Companies don't empower them because they assume they shouldn't. Bad products reinforce the belief that AI is doomed. The spiral locks in. My former coworker—the composite of three people for anonymity—now believes she's both unqualified for AI work and that AI isn't worth doing anyway. She's wrong on both counts, but the culture made sure she'd land there. Seattle has talent as good as anywhere. But in San Francisco, people still believe they can change the world—so sometimes they actually do.

Title: We Might Finally Get Some Big AI IPOs—Which Would Mean a Look at Their Financials

Here come the big AI IPOs. (Maybe.) Anthropic, maker of the Claude chatbot, is preparing for an initial public offering that could come next year, according to the Financial Times. The company is also said to be in talks to raise funding that would push its valuation over $300 billion. The report followed others saying OpenAI, the company behind rival ChatGPT, is also getting ready for an IPO that could drive its valuation to $1 trillion. Spokespeople for both Anthropic and OpenAI denied having set plans for an IPO in those reports. The first of these companies to reach public markets will set the bar for the rest—and open up the AI-investment landscape beyond the biggest publicly traded tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META), whose stock valuations have lately stoked concerns of bubble-ish excesses. It would also give the masses a good look at the economics of AI language-model developers. Elon Musk's xAI, the company behind the Grok chatbot, in late November was said to be preparing to close a $15 billion fundraising round in December, pushing its pre-money valuation to $230 billion. The most well-known AI frontier startups—companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Databricks, Perplexity and xAI—are private. One going public could prompt others to follow, which would open up the AI investment landscape beyond the chipmakers and Big Tech companies that investors have poured dollars into. IPO documents, particularly those called S-1 filings, are rich sources of information, because companies are legally bound to give public-market investors a thorough look at the business before they raise funds from them. The big reveal is in the financials—what revenue growth looks like, profit margins, and how much cash companies are burning to develop new products, the latter of which has been a source of AI investor angst. They'll also show companies' cap tables, detailing their ownership structure. Filings from Anthropic or OpenAI would adress a lot of investor questions about the state of frontier AI development. Meanwhile, private markets are flush with AI startups. The sector has drawn roughly 65% of venture capital investments in 2025 through the third quarter, according a PitchBook's report published this week. Though that figure is skewed by the multibillion-dollar fundraising rounds of a few big startups, it also shows how ubiquitous such startups have become. "No other emerging technology has accounted for a larger share of total deal activity," PitchBook director of research Kyle Stanford and his team wrote in the report. The old high-water mark was in early 2013, when mobile accounted for roughly 20% of deal counts; AI accounts for 35% currently. That could make for an exciting pipeline of coming IPOs if one AI startup unlocks the floodgates to public markets. But it could also fuel Dotcom bubble comparisons.

Title: This Meta Quest 3 charging dock won't stop beeping at me, but damn does it keep my VR setup neat and tidy

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The PrismXR charging dock is certainly one of the neatest stands for the Quest 3 you'll find on the shelves. It keeps things low-profile, charges the headset and its controllers, and doesn't take up much room on a shelf or desk. But there are some definite annoyances that prevent this from being an easy recommendation. Charges the controllers and the headset Supplies rechargeable batteries for the controllers Neat, tidy look while on display Handy indicator LEDs to show how much each element is charged Compatible with headstraps from other brands Annoying, incessant beeping Doesn't seem to turn itself off when the headset is fully charged Separate version for the Quest 3S -Not the fastest method of charging Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Pretty soon after setting up my Quest 3, I realised how quickly the controllers lose battery. In fact, even if I didn't use them or the headset for a week or two, I'd frequently come back to find them completely drained. Having only used a charging stand that gave power to the headset itself, I knew my budget for batteries would thank me if I tried something that charged the controllers too. So, to the best Meta Quest accessories I turned, and of all the available charging stands, PrismXR's filled the most gaps in the market for me. It charges the headset and the controllers, but also feels perfect for anyone who wants a pretty low-profile way of displaying their VR loadout. It doesn't have fancy RGB or stand too high for a lot of shelfing units, and its aesthetic matches the Quest 3's as though it was made by Meta itself. For $69.99 / £69.99, it's roughly on par with the cost of most other charging docks, so let's see how it performs. Having just reviewed the PrismXR charging belt for Quest 3 and 3S, I had high hopes for this dock as a follow-up. Just like the charging belt, this is fairly self-explanatory. The Carina D1 is a dock that you can plug in via USB-C that'll magnetically charge your headset and controllers. Rather annoyingly, because this was designed with the Meta Quest 3 in mind before the 3S arrived on the scene, it has a fairly snug design that's bespoke for the original VR headset. For that reason, you'll need to opt for a separate version of this device for the Quest 3S, which leaves the door open for wrong purchases, but does help to create a neater match with whichever headset you own. From a quick search of both charging docks on Amazon and at PrismXR's own website, they seem to do the exact same thing, and for the most part, are the same price. That said, I'd think about looking into the price history of either at your own leisure because, like any and all Quest 3 accessories, their prices fluctuate madly. To keep the controllers charged, the D1 dock comes with rechargeable batteries, as well as different grip plates for your controllers so that they can attach magnetically. These feel exactly the same as the stock ones when using the controllers during VR play, and only take a minute to swap out. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Magnetics are the name of the game here, as magnetic charging pins are used to connect the bottom of the headset to the charging dock. For the overall aesthetic of the Carina D1, this helps to keep things nice and neat - there are no cables to be seen from the front. Perhaps my favorite thing about the dock's design is that it has a handy head strap pedestal at the back, which allows for more compatibility with third-party accessories. I was worried my KIWI Design Comfort Battery Strap wouldn't fit, but thanks to this handy add-on, I had no problems. In terms of technicals, the Carina D1 Charging Dock can Fast Charge up to 27W, which PrismXR says will take your Quest 3 from 0% to 50% in 45 minutes, and fully charge in 1hr50. The controllers have a quoted charging time of 2hr30. There are also some handy LED indicators on the front of the stand that tell you what level of battery the headset and two controllers are, and as I'll come on to, there are audible indicating bleeps too. I really like the look of the PrismXR charging dock. Its nest design means I was spoiled for choice for where to put it in my living space. It could fit in one of the shelves in my cube unit because it isn't too tall. It's not obnoxiously wide, so it can sit nicely with the other gaming hardware on my desk or a shelf. But at the same time, it still looks neat and tidy, and its white design lines up exactly with the color of the headset. The only real test of this dock, besides its looks, is how it charges the headset and controllers. If I'm honest, I'd like it to be a bit quicker, but that's mainly because I'm used to plugging it in at the wall with a super-fast charger and seeing it juice up pretty speedily. Arguably, for a charging stand, I don't think it necessarily needs to be super quick because it's where you put it when you know it'll be sitting to rest between sessions. Still, I found it took around an hour to charge the headset up to its 50% mark while the controllers were also connected - which I suppose matches up with the quoted 45-minute mark that I'll assume refers to just the headset being connected. The times when I've used this charging stand and haven't been faced with annoying bleeps fill me with more confidence that this isn't an issue you'll definitely run into At least the indicating LEDs are a handy way to keep tabs on charging progress. What isn't so handy is a very loud beeping tone that the D1 will pierce your eardrums with. When you first connect the headset and controllers, it'll beep. When it finishes charging them? It'll beep, and sometimes, keep beeping. I've seen reports of these bleeps being buggy and incessant for multiple users. Certainly, the first time I used the D1, that's the experience I had when my headset reached full charge. Other reports seem to suggest that the beeping is due to a faulty connection, which would line up with my experience of other times when the headset reached full charge, then didn't beep at all. Either way, these beeps are loud and a very annoying point of convenience-gone-wrong if they continually bug out for people. What's more unclear is whether or not the dock can turn itself off when the Quest 3 reaches full charge, because if not, it could cause you battery life issues further down the road. Unless you go and unplug the dock entirely or remove the headset so the magnetic pins aren't connected, it could keep charging your headset, or, in my case, beeping loudly. The times when I've used this charging stand and haven't been faced with annoying bleeps fill me with more confidence that this isn't an issue you'll definitely run into, but since this is a known issue for other users who have had larger connection problems, it's all a little unclear. Considering this brand's charging belt will turn itself off when it detects a fully charged headset, it's a bit of a shame that the charging dock isn't more upfront that it will do so as well. If you touch the LEDs, they'll go to sleep, but I'm not sure whether that actually turns the charging power off. Thankfully, I've found that my headset will still sit fine on the dock when it's just out of place enough that the pins aren't touching. This isn't ideal though, and goes against the snug aesthetic the charging stand is going for. Irritating beeping aside, I do think this charging stand is one of the better and more versatile ones available for the Quest 3. PrismXR has made something that's well designed and caters to a large cross-section of VR gamers who have lots of storage needs and headstraps already integrated into their setups. It's a shame that the charging isn't quicker, and there's definite friction with those indicating bleeps - which seem to be the most frequently reported issue in most customer reviews. Regardless, this is a charging stand I'll be keeping in my loadout, mainly thanks to its convenience of charging the headset along with its controllers, which can prove tricky otherwise. I integrated the PrismXR Carina D1 Charging Dock into my gaming setup for a number of weeks before this review was written. Since receiving the testing sample from PrismXR, it's been my main method of charging my VR headset and controllers. To put it to the test, I set a timer on how long it took to charge the headset in various scenarios: when it was at 0%, when it was at 50% going to 100%, and a full charge. I compared my experience to my time spent with other Quest 3 accessories. For more on how we test the latest gadgets, check out the GamesRadar+ hardware policy. Happy with flat screen games for now?

Title: Dave’s Hot Chicken is placing broad bets on AI to give the restaurant chain an edge in the chicken wars

Time Published: 2025-12-03T17:44:27Z
Full Content:
Leon Davoyan, the chief technology officer for Dave’s Hot Chicken, has ramped up the application of artificial intelligence across the restaurant chain’s operations, including the drive-thru, mobile ordering, rover delivery, and robotic arms that whip up french fries. But he is cautious not to lose the human touch of hospitality. That AI-enabled drive-thru—a trendy application of AI that historically hasn’t had the smoothest deployment for larger chains including McDonald’s and Taco Bell—isn’t intended to replace workers. “Our strategy is to allow the human to do more with the robot assistant,” says Davoyan. All that said, successful deployments of AI, robotics, and other emerging technologies could give Dave’s Hot Chicken an edge in the fast-growing and highly competitive chicken restaurant category that includes incumbent brands like Chick-fil-A and Popeyes and fast-growing concepts like Raising Cane’s, Hangry Joe’s Hot Chicken & Wings, and Dave’s. Quick-service and fast-casual chicken restaurants expanded their domestic unit count by 4.7% in 2024 from the prior year, along with a sales leap of nearly 10%, according to market research Datassential. Adding more AI-enabled functionality to Dave’s Hot Chicken’s ordering systems has been a core priority for Davoyan over the past year and a half and will continue to be an area of focus in 2026. He has launched AI drive-thru ordering and hopes that the learnings from this application can be used to train large language models that could be tapped for similar functionality in the company’s mobile app. Dave’s Hot Chicken, which was acquired by private equity firm Roark Capital in a deal valued at around $1 billion earlier this year, is also working with several vendors to develop more precise predictions for when food will be ready. The times are then displayed on a digital order board within the store. When stores are busy, orders can take up to 45 minutes to be ready. Davoyan says he wants the predictive technology to get inside two minutes of accuracy. At the test stores where these systems have been deployed, Davoyan says the chain is adding seven to eight more transactions per week above locations that don’t have this feature. “The hypothesis is becoming true that if you serve up order-ready times more accurately, then the orders will come,” he adds. Dave’s Hot Chicken has also implemented some text-based updates for mobile orders, and in the future, Davoyan says he wants to add in-app order status updates similar to what DoorDash and Uber Eats offers. At the front counter of the restaurant, Dave’s Hot Chicken has deployed kiosks, which are positioned to be slightly tilted so the cashier can monitor ordering progress and step in if there are any issues. The company says 23% of in-restaurant orders are booked by the kiosks today, and they increase the check amount by an average of 5.9%. Davoyan says this revenue generation results in a return on investment that’s under a year. “We don’t remove the human element,” says Davoyan. “We have yet to reduce head count with all the things that we’re testing.” Davoyan has also rolled out Microsoft Copilot across the corporate office, though he’s not completely sold on the maturity of the technology. “I think there are other solutions that we should explore,” he says. Other internal applications of AI include customer service, where favorable restaurant reviews get an AI-written response that’s automatically published online, while the reviews with more critical feedback are reviewed and edited by a customer service agent before the AI drafted response is approved. AI is also being used for drone and rover deliveries and will be incorporated in the company’s two test robotic arms at the fry station. “We’re going to use AI to predict how many fries we’re going to need,” says Davoyan, who wants these robots to produce a constant flow of fresh fries that doesn’t hurt food quality. He says that the autonomous french fry functionality is seeing a return on investment, but not yet below the two-year threshold that Dave’s Hot Chicken looks for when spending on tech. “Robots are very expensive,” says Davoyan. “It creates a barrier of entry for restaurants.” Dave’s Hot Chicken also managed to completely avoid the Amazon Web Services cloud outage that ensnared tech firms, banks, and airlines in October. The company’s point of sale system relies on the vendor Qu, which has installed a physical device that runs cloud locally in every store. “We made all of our customers deploy the edge device,” says Amir Hudda, Qu’s CEO, whose other clients include Blaze Pizza and Jack in the Box. None of those restaurants were impacted by the AWS shutdown. Davoyan says Infrastructure is easy to take for granted because of the general reliability that tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft offer their customers. But big outages have become more commonplace, including at Cloudflare last month and Microsoft Azure in October. And because restaurants operate on extremely thin margins, they cannot afford lost sales when POS systems are down and orders need to be halted or processed by hand. “We knew that the day would come where there would be some level of meltdown and because we have high volume locations, we made that a priority,” says Davoyan. “You should always have a backup plan.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. OpenAI issues "Code Red" as Google mounts challenge. The Wall Street Journalreports on a company memo issued this week by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that declared a "code red" to focus efforts on bolstering ChatGPT, including increasing its speed and reliability, and put less effort on other products. This comes less than a month after Google's newest model, Gemini 3, won rave reviews for its capabilities in reasoning, coding, and some tasks performed by AI chatbots. In other news on OpenAI, the company on Monday announced it would take an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, a deal that would enable OpenAI to embed more AI tools in accounting and IT services companies. Separately, the AI startup also struck a deal with Accenture, giving ChatGPT Enterprise access to tens of thousands of the consulting giant’s employees. Nvidia makes yet another AI investment. The AI chipmaker announced it bought a $2 billion stake in Synopsys, part of an expanded partnership between the pair as they plan to integrate Nvidia’s AI capabilities with Synopsys’ engineering solutions targeted to research and development teams across a number of sectors including aerospace and automotive. Nvidia has been on an AI investment splurge, recently pouring $100 billion into OpenAI, $15 billion alongside Microsoft in Anthropic, and $5 billion in Intel. DeepSeek debuts new AI models that rival OpenAI, Google. China-based AI startup DeepSeek debuted two new versions of an experimental AI model that it claims match some od the capabilities of OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google’s Gemini-3 Pro. Bloomberg reports that the new AI models have fresh capabilities to help combine reasoning and execute certain actions autonomously. Venturebeat reports that the claim of parity with DeepSeek’s American rivals is based on testing across mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks. There’s been a steady drumbeat of new AI model rollouts over the past couple of weeks, including from Anthropic, Google, and Runway—the latter on Monday unveiled a new video model it says is good at understanding physics, human motion, camera movements, and cause and effect. HP cutting jobs as it contends with higher chips costs. The PC maker announced it would cut 4,000 to 6,000 employees through fiscal 2028 as it plans to apply more usage of AI tools to areas like product development, customer support, and sales and marketing, CEO Enrique Lores told Bloomberg. The company has recently benefited from increased demand for new AI PCs but is also dealing with higher memory chips prices, which is cutting into profits. Layoffs have also recently been announced at Apple, which cut some sales jobs, and at Verizon, with the telecommunications giant trimming 13,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce. The cuts across major tech giants comes as a recent KPMG survey showed that 52% of U.S. workers fear AI will replace their jobs, a fear that’s nearly doubled from last year. Campbell’s fires IT exec after accusations of racist remarks caught on audio. Campbell’s last week disclosed that Martin Bally, a VP of IT, was no longer with the food giant after the company reviewed an audio recording in which the executive allegedly said the company’s products were “highly processed food” for “poor people.” The audiotape surfaced as part of an ongoing lawsuit with a former employee who alleged Bally had made racist remarks about Indian workers. Bally had worked at Campbell’s for nearly four years and previously served in technology leadership roles at automotive manufacturer Stellantis and automotive products supplier American Axle & Manufacturing. Real estate industry embraces AI but few are fully pleased with their AI pilots. The number of corporate real estate property managers running AI pilots has soared from 5% in 2023 to 92% by July of this year and these property occupiers are pursuing an average of five pilot projects simultaneously across a broad swatch of use cases ranging from documentation to energy management to design and construction planning, according to a survey of over 1,000 senior CRE decision-makers conducted by commercial real estate and investment management company JLL. “That is really surprising, because the commercial real estate industry is usually considered to be a laggard in terms of adopting technology,” says Yao Morin, CTO at JLL, in an interview with Fortune. Still, Morin notes that the survey found that only 5% of CRE leaders report they have achieved “most program goals” with their AI pilots. She said some pain points that JLL has observed include the messiness of organizing real estate data, which relies on a lot of unstructured data from physical operations, and accurately measuring how much efficiency can actually be derived from AI tools.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AAM.5gsm9dvqh Share article Print article As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into workplace systems and operations, it’s reshaping both how work tasks are completed and the very experience of work itself. For many employees, AI is stress-testing their tolerance for uncertainty and job insecurity. Some positions are being automated entirely. Others are becoming redundant. In many cases, full-time roles are being reduced to part-time or contract work. These changes have been very visible in this year’s news headlines. UPS, for example, announced 20,000 layoffs in April while expressing interest in deploying humanoid robots from Figure AI to take over warehouse tasks. Recently, this disruption has moved beyond front-line roles. Amazon has revealed plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs to reorganize around AI-enhanced efficiency. Microsoft laid off roughly 6,000 employees — most of them software engineers and programmers — as AI systems now generate up to 30 per cent of new code on its projects. Employees do not stand on equal footing in the face of these changes, nor do they experience the same level of vulnerability. The capacity to respond to AI-related job threats varies sharply based on income, education, race and digital access. These disparities ultimately shape who can adapt and leverage new technological opportunities, and who becomes excluded from them and left behind. Employees face unequal vulnerability to AI-related job threats largely because automation disproportionately targets entry-level and front-line positions. These are typically lower-wage roles, often held by people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and marginalized communities. Such positions typically involve routine or repetitive tasks in sectors like customer service, retail, administration, warehousing and food service. Reports show these jobs are up to 14 times more likely to be displaced than higher-wage positions. Women are 1.5 times more likely than men to be pushed into new occupations as a result. People in these roles also face greater barriers in accessing employment and advancement opportunities, which perpetuates cycles of economic insecurity among groups that are already vulnerable. In contrast, AI is significantly boosting efficiency and productivity for knowledge workers in higher-wage positions. Surveys show 75 per cent of knowledge workers now use AI tools and report a 66 per cent average increase in productivity. These employees are far better positioned to integrate AI into their workflow. For example, national data shows that Canadian employees benefit most from AI when their jobs involve “complementary” tasks. These are tasks that AI can augment or enhance. This complementarity is strongly tied to education. It is highest among employees with graduate degrees and steadily declines as education levels drop. As a result, the benefits associated with AI flow disproportionately to higher-educated, high-income professional workers, enabling them to manage larger workloads and complete tasks faster. Some workers save up to one-third of their work hours. AI can also improve the quality of their work. Research shows consultants who use AI produce work that is more than 40 per cent higher in quality than those who don’t use AI. These advantages can accelerate career progression and income growth for people already in privileged socioeconomic positions. These patterns reinforce existing class inequities by expanding opportunities for those in high-income, professional roles while deepening precarity for those in low-income, entry-level and front-line roles. Upskilling and reskilling are often presented as solutions to AI-related job threats, but access to these opportunities is unevenly distributed across social groups. Upskilling refers to developing more advanced skills within a current role, while reskilling involves learning entirely new skills to transition into a different job. High-income, highly educated professionals receive far more institutional support to upskill or reskill, such as employer-funded training, paid time to learn new tools and access to advanced digital tools. In contrast, workers from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and low-income jobs often lack the financial means, time and organizational support needed to develop new skills. These structural gaps are reflected in participation rates: a survey by Gallup and Amazon shows that 75 per cent of workers in computer-related occupations engage in upskilling, compared with less than one-third of workers in office administration, food service, production and transportation roles. As a result, workers in precarious and vulnerable positions are further disadvantaged by the barriers they face in accessing opportunities to respond to technological threats. Differences in digital access and literacy create another layer of inequality in how different groups experience AI. The digital divide is tied to disparities in digital and AI literacy across income, geography, age, education and occupation. People in high-income, white-collar roles, urban areas and well-resourced institutions typically have reliable internet, AI tools and access to digital skills training. They also develop AI literacy through formal education and job training, which gives them more opportunities to experiment with AI and integrate it into their work. However, those in manual jobs, rural areas, low-income households, marginalized communities and older age groups often lack stable connectivity, updated technology and access to formal training, making AI adoption more difficult for them. This leaves them more vulnerable to AI-related job threats. These gaps in access and skills reinforce existing socioeconomic inequalities by concentrating the benefits of AI among advantaged groups while heightening the risks for those with fewer resources. AI holds great potential to positively impact employees, organizations and the workplace. However, without equitable access to upskilling, reskilling, training, digital resources and AI literacy, the technology can deepen the disparities between different social groups. Closing these gaps and creating fair opportunities for adaptation is essential if AI is to benefit our society more broadly and equitably.

Now for the bad news. The Lord of the Rings MMORPG that’s been in development since early 2023 has sadly been cancelled. This is bad news for the LOTR gamers, who haven’t had an MMORPG based on the franchise since 2007. Many other games from The Lord of the Rings franchise have had fantastic reviews and were loved by gamers, so it goes without saying that the loss hit hard. According to Comicbook’s Jonathan H. Kantor, the loss is the result of massive layoffs over at Amazon, whose Amazon Games was in charge of publishing the new game. Its definitely disappointing, but maybe there’s hope for another LOTR game in the future. Want to stay up to date with all the latest The Lord of the Rings news and collectibles?

Wrap up the year with big savings! Lock in your 2026 SEJ sponsorships now and save up to 15%! 2026 marks the beginning of the “Agentic Era,” where AI stops just consuming the web and starts writing to it. Previous predictions: 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 This is my 8th time publishing annual predictions. As always, the goal is not to be right but to practice thinking. For example, in 2018, I predicted “Niche communities will be discovered as a great channel for growth” and “Email marketing will return” in 2019. It took another 6 years. That same year, I also wrote “Smart speakers will become a viable user-acquisition channel in 2018”. Well… Boost your skills with Growth Memo’s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free! For the past three years, we have lived in the “generative era,” where AI could read the internet and summarize it for us. 2026 marks the beginning of the “agentic era,” where AI stops just consuming the web and starts writing to it – a shift from information retrieval to task execution. This isn’t just a feature update; it is a fundamental restructuring of the digital economy. The web is bifurcating into two distinct layers: A big question mark is advertising, where Google’s expansion of ads into AI Mode and ChatGPT showing ads to free users could alleviate pressure on CPCs, but AI Overviews (AIOs) could drive them up. 2026 could be a year of wild price swings where smart teams (your “holistic pods”) move budget daily between Google (high cost/high intent) and ChatGPT (low cost/discovery) to exploit the spread. It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the one most adaptable to change. — Leon C. Megginso Prediction: I forecast an “Extinction Event” in Q3 2026 for the standalone AI visibility tracking category. Rather than a simple consolidation, our analysis shows the majority of pure-play tracking startups might fold or sell for parts as their 2025 funding runways expire simultaneously without the revenue growth to justify Series B rounds. Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: It’ll be harder for spammers to influence AI visibility in 2026 with link spam, mass-generated AI content, and cloaking. By 2026, agents will likely use Multi-Source Corroboration to eliminate this asymmetry. Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: AI Overviews (AIOs) scale to 75% of keywords for big sites. AI Mode rolls out to 10-20% of queries. Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: By 2026, “identity spoofing” will become the single largest cybersecurity risk for public companies. We move from, Is this content real? to Is this source verified? Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: OpenAI shifts to a hybrid pricing model in 2026: An “ad-supported free tier” and “credit-based pro tier.” Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: Perplexity will be acquired in late 2026 for $25-$30 billion. After its user growth plateaus at ~50 million MAU, the “unit economics wall” forces a sale to a giant that needs its technology (real-time RAG), not its business model. Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: Nvidia stock will correct by >20% in 2026 as its largest customers successfully shift 15-20% of their workloads to custom internal silicon. This causes a P/E compression from ~45x to ~30x as the market realizes Nvidia is no longer a monopoly, but a “competitor” in a commoditized market. (Not investment advice!)

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading lower on Wednesday after an ADP report showing job losses, following a stellar day across Wall Street on Tuesday. All of the major indices finished the day higher, with the technology-heavy NASDAQ leading the way, closing up 0.59% at 23,413. The S&P 500 ended the session at 6,829, up 0.25% and the Dow Jones Industrials were last seen at 47,474, up 0.39%. Traders and investors are still experiencing weekly volatility whiplash, so it’s difficult to determine whether any given day marks the start or end of a trend, up or down. The one consistent tailwind for stocks is the prospect of another Fed funds rate cut next week, now priced in at an 80% probability, up from as low as 20% a month ago. Strength in technology stocks and a cryptocurrency rally helped to drive shares higher on Tuesday. Yields were down across the curve as buyers returned, and the song remains the same: The anticipation of a rate cut next week, combined with prospects for economic growth in 2026, seems to be the two factors that are driving yields on any given day. With the smart money leaning on President Trump’s economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, to be the next Federal Reserve Chairman, it’s a good bet that rates could be lowered even more in 2026. The 30-year-long bond closed at a 4.75% yield while the benchmark 10-year note finished the session at 4.09% In a complete reversal from yesterday, prices were lower across the energy sector, with both major benchmarks and Natural gas closing lower. The same combination of oversupply and changing prospects for ending the Russia-Ukraine war continues to tip the scales one way or another on any given day. Brent Crude closed Tuesday at $62.43, down 1.17%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen $58.62, down 1.18%. Natural gas completed the trifecta on Tuesday, closing down 1.83% at $4.83. Like the back-up in the energy sector, gold suffered the same fate on Tuesday as the risk-off mood that lifted stocks contributed to the selling in the precious metals. Top sector analysts attributed the move lower to trading accounts taking advantage of the recent moves higher and taking profits. Gold finished the day at $4,226, while Silver was last seen at $57.59. Cryptocurrencies rallied on Tuesday as recent dovish shifts in the Federal Reserve’s policy and the easing of liquidity pressures boosted risk assets like crypto, while advancements in decentralized applications and generally positive market sentiment also contributed to higher prices. The 30% drop in Bitcoin over the last couple of months was also a factor, as bargain-hunting investors were buyers. Bitcoin was trading at $91,494 at 5 PM EST, while Ethereum was quoted at $2,990. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Stock futures are slightly higher and bitcoin is rising as the market looks to add to yesterday's gains; AI company Anthropic is reportedly considering an initial public offering; Apple is expected to post its best year of iPhone sales thanks to strong demand in China; shares of Marvell Technology are soaring after the chip company reported strong earnings; and American Eagle stock is surging after the retailer said its performance got a boost from its affiliations with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open this morning as the market looks to gain ground for the second straight session after having a week-long winning streak snapped on Monday. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq were up 0.2% recently. The major indexes posted solid gains on Tuesday as tech stocks rallied and bitcoin rebounded from a recent sell-off. Bitcoin was trading at $93,000 recently, up from an overnight low of around $91,000 and a low on Monday below $84,000. Gold futures were up 0.5% at $4,245 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures rose 1.3% to $59.40 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was at 4.06%, down from 4.09% at yesterday's close. AI company Anthropic, backed by Amazon (AMZN) and the maker of the Claude chatbot, is reportedly in the early stages of considering an initial public offering the Financial Times reported. The company is reportedly working with a high-profile IPO law firm, and is in preliminary talks with banks to gauge interest. Anthropic is also considering raising more funding privately, with a new round that could include $15 billion from AI heavyweights Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and would value Anthropic at over $300 billion. AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI have commanded tremendous amounts of money from the private capital markets in recent years, but few purely AI companies are on the stock market today. Reports have also suggested that ChatGPT maker OpenAI is considering an IPO, but not in the immediate future, according to CNBC. Going public would require more financial disclosures than OpenAI and Anthropic are required to provide as private companies, and test how prepared investors are to put money into AI chatbot makers that have been burning through tens of billions in recent years with an unclear path to profitability. Apple (AAPL) is expected to post a record number of smartphone shipments globally in 2025 thanks to the success of its iPhone 17 model, according to data released by International Data Corporation. IDC estimates that Apple shipments will surpass 247 million units this year, a 6.1% increase from the year before. Huge demand in China is primarily responsible for the surge. IDC projects that Apple's China sales for the fourth quarter will be 17% higher than a year ago, while sales growth for the full year will be up 3%, both well above previous projections. IDC expects the global smartphone market to contract by 0.9% in 2026 owing to a shortage of memory components. Also, Apple reportedly has considered moving the iPhone 18 launch to early 2027 rather than its typical fall announcement and release window. Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) are soaring in premarket trading after the semiconductor manufacturer topped profit estimates and announced a $3.25 billion acquisition. Marvell posted earnings in its fiscal 2026 third quarter of 76 cents per share, slightly topping the Wall Street consensus, while revenue of $2.07 billion matched analysts' estimates. Meanwhile, Marvell announced a deal to acquire Celestial AI, whose technology Marvell says can help make the servers inside the data centers that train and run AI models more efficient. Marvell expects the deal to close in the first quarter of next year, with Celestial AI meaningfully contributing to revenue by the back half of fiscal 2028. Marvell stock, which through yesterday's close was down 16% since the start of the year, rose more than 10% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are surging after the clothing retailer posted strong results and raised its outlook. The clothing retailer behind its namesake brand and others including Aerie said Tuesday it generated $1.36 billion in revenue in the third quarter, along with earnings per share of $0.53. Each was higher than the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Comparable store sales rose 4% across the whole company. American Eagle lifted its forecasts for sales growth and operating income for the fourth quarter. In its earnings call, CEO Jay Schottenstein called out the company's recent marketing partnerships with celebrities such as actress Sydney Sweeney and Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, saying they delivered "measurable benefits," per an AlphaSense transcript.

Learn the strategic landing page audit process to boost your conversion rates. Your campaigns are only as strong as the pages they lead to. You can have the most targeted ads, the sharpest copy, and a budget that makes your CFO nervous. But if your landing page doesn’t deliver on what the ad promised, you’re leaving money on the table and feeding poor signals back into your campaign algorithms. Landing pages are where intent meets experience. When they align, conversion rates increase. When they don’t, even high-quality traffic bounces, and your cost-per-acquisition (CPA) spirals upward. This post walks through the core elements of a high-performing landing page strategy. This strategy is one that not only converts visitors, but also strengthens your ad campaigns. Whether you’re running Google Ads or Meta campaigns, these landing page strategies apply. Most advertisers focus heavily on the ad itself: the creative, the targeting, the bid strategy. That makes sense. But the landing page is where the actual conversion happens. It’s the final step in the funnel, and it has a direct impact on campaign performance. Here’s why landing page audits should be a regular part of your paid media workflow: When more visitors convert, your cost per conversion drops. That gives you more room to scale or reinvest budget into other channels. Platforms like Google and Meta rely on conversion data to optimize your campaigns. If your landing page isn’t converting, the algorithm receives weak or misleading signals, which limits its ability to find high-intent users. Google rewards landing pages that are relevant, fast, and user-friendly. A higher quality score can lower your cost-per-click (CPC) and improve ad placement. In short, your landing page isn’t just a conversion tool. It’s a feedback loop that shapes how well your campaigns perform over time. The first rule of landing page optimization is simple: Match the message. If your ad promises “free shipping on running shoes,” your landing page should immediately confirm that offer. If the ad targets “B2B marketing automation tools,” the page should speak directly to that audience and use case. Message match builds trust. When a visitor clicks an ad and lands on a page that looks, feels, and sounds different, they bounce. Fast. Here’s how to ensure relevance: The fewer mental leaps a visitor has to make, the more likely they are to convert. Your call-to-action (CTA) is the most important element on the page. It’s where intent turns into action. But too many landing pages bury the CTA, use vague language, or overwhelm visitors with multiple competing actions. That creates friction and kills conversions. Here’s how to get CTAs right: Your CTA should feel like the natural next step, not a sales pitch. Zoho CRM’s website is an excellent example of a landing page leveraging these points: Specific offer: The header “Get started with your 15-day free trial” is highly specific, clarifying the duration and type of offer, addressing the vagueness of a simple “Get Started.” Visual contrast: The primary CTA button, “GET STARTED,” is a high-contrast, bright red that immediately draws the eye away from the surrounding white and blue elements. Action-oriented copy: While the button copy is “GET STARTED,” the text immediately below it clarifies the action as a free trial sign-up, maintaining clarity. Furthermore, the page limits distractions, focusing the user on the single action of signing up for the trial. This approach effectively guides the user toward the intended conversion. Visuals aren’t just decoration. They communicate value, build trust, and guide the visitor’s attention. The right images can make your offer feel tangible and desirable. The wrong ones create confusion or undermine credibility. Here’s what works: Strong visuals support your copy. They don’t compete with it. Superside’s landing page demonstrates using a portfolio of images to support the message that they can handle diverse creative needs for clients across different industries: Show the outcome: Instead of a single generic image, the page prominently features a collage of actual client deliverables (app interfaces, product packaging, social media graphics) for brands like Amazon, Reddit, and Zapier. This directly illustrates the quality and range of the service’s outcome. Communicate value and trust: By showing recognized brand logos and diverse project types, the imagery instantly builds credibility and reinforces the claim that they can “Scale your in-house creative team with top global talent.” Avoid clutter (in context): While it’s a collage, the consistent presentation style and the grouping of images in a grid are purposefully designed to communicate a broad portfolio quickly, which directly reinforces the main headline: “Your creative team’s creative team.” This strategy uses visuals to provide immediate, tangible proof of the service’s capability. Your landing page needs to answer one critical question: Why should I choose you over the competition? This is where you articulate your unique value proposition (UVP). It’s not just about listing features. It’s about showing how your product or service solves a specific problem better than the alternatives. Here’s how to communicate your UVP effectively: Your UVP should be immediately visible, ideally above the fold. If a visitor has to scroll to understand what you’re offering, you’ve already lost some of them. Social proof reduces risk. It shows visitors that other people (ideally, people like them) have chosen your product or service and been satisfied. But not all social proof is created equal. The key is to use a mix of formats and place them strategically throughout the page. Here are the most effective types of social proof to look for when you are doing a landing page audit: Short, specific quotes from real customers carry more weight than generic praise. Include the customer’s name, title, and company (if B2B) to increase credibility. “We increased conversions by 30%” is more compelling than “Great service!” Quantifiable outcomes resonate, especially with data-driven buyers. If well-known brands use your product, feature their logos. Recognition builds instant trust. Aggregate ratings (e.g., “4.8/5 stars from 1,200+ customers”) provide quick validation. Link to third-party review sites like G2, Trustpilot, or Capterra for added credibility. Security seals, industry certifications, and compliance badges (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR) that are visible on landing pages reassure visitors that their data is safe. Place social proof near your CTA. That’s where hesitation peaks, and reassurance matters most. The Reddit Ads landing page demonstrates the effective use of logos of recognizable clients or partners to build instant trust and social proof: Client credibility: At the bottom of the page, a prominent line on the landing page reads, “Trusted businesses across all industries and sizes use Reddit Ads to meet their goals.” This statement is immediately backed up by a scrolling horizontal display of recognizable brand logos, including Mars, GameStop, Capital One, and Maybelline. Instant trust: For a potential advertiser, seeing global, established brands using the platform reduces the perceived risk of signing up. If major companies trust Reddit Ads with their budget, a new user can be reassured the platform is legitimate and effective. Strategic placement: The logo section is placed below the main registration form and the tool to explore audience, providing reinforcement just before a user might scroll away or hesitate. It offers a final, compelling piece of proof that supports the core message of reaching a “niche audience.” This visual list of successful clients serves as powerful validation for the service. A beautiful landing page means anything if it doesn’t load quickly or breaks on mobile devices. Technical performance directly impacts conversion rates and campaign quality scores. Google prioritizes fast, mobile-friendly pages, and visitors abandon slow-loading sites within seconds, noting that 53% of visits are likely to be abandoned if pages take longer than three seconds to load. Here’s what to audit: Technical problems aren’t just annoying. They cost you conversions and damage your campaign performance. Where you place your CTA matters just as much as what it says. Most landing pages include a primary CTA above the fold, and that’s a really good start. But high-converting pages use multiple CTAs placed at natural decision points throughout the page. Here’s a strategic approach: Each CTA should feel contextual, not pushy. It should align with where the visitor is in their journey down the page. Your landing page isn’t just a conversion tool. It’s a data generator. Every click, scroll, and form submission sends signals back to your ad platform. These signals teach the algorithm which audiences convert, which creatives work, and how to allocate budget more efficiently. When your landing page converts well, those signals are strong and accurate. The algorithm learns faster and optimizes better. When your landing page underperforms, the data becomes noisy. The algorithm struggles to find patterns, and your campaigns stagnate. This is why landing page audits are essential. A small improvement in conversion rate doesn’t just boost revenue. It improves the quality of data feeding back into your campaigns, creating a compounding effect over time. Start by identifying your lowest-performing landing pages. Run A/B tests on headlines, CTAs, and imagery. Measure the impact not just on conversions, but on downstream metrics like CPA, return on ad spend (ROAS), and customer lifetime value (LTV). The better your landing pages perform, the smarter your campaigns become.

Title: Are we repeating the telecoms crash with AI datacenters?
URL: https://martinalderson.com/posts/are-we-really-repeating-the-telecoms-crash-with-ai-datacenters/
Time Published: 2025-12-03T11:14:56Z
Full Content:
I keep hearing the AI datacentre boom compared to the 2000s telecoms crash. The parallels seem obvious - billions in infrastructure spending, concerns about overbuilding, warnings of an imminent bubble. But when I actually ran the numbers, the fundamentals look completely different. I'm not here to predict whether there will or won't be a crash or correction. I just want to look at whether the comparison to telecoms actually holds up when you examine the history in a bit more detail. Let me start with what the 2000s telecoms crash actually looked like, because the details matter. Firstly, there was massive capex - between 1995 and 2000 somewhere like $2 trillion was spent laying 80-90 million miles of fiber. Inflation adjusted, this is over $4trillion, or close to $1trillion/year in 2025 dollars. By 2002 only 2.7% of this fibre was used. How did this happen? A catastrophic supply and demand miscalculation past the pure securities fraud involved in many of the companies. Telecom CEOs claimed internet traffic was doubling every 3-4 months. But in reality, traffic was doubling roughly every 12 months. That's a 4x overestimate of demand growth, which compounds each year. This false assumption drove massive debt-financed overbuilding. If you overestimate 4x a year for 3 years, by the end of your scenario you are 256x out. Even worse for these companies, enormous strides were made on the optical transceivers, allowing the same fibre to carry 100,000x more traffic over the following decade. Just one example is WDM multiplexing, allowing multiple carriers to be multiplexed on the same physical fibre line. In 1995 state of the art was 4-8 carriers. By 2000, it was 128. This alone allowed a 64x increase in capacity with the same infrastructure. Combined with improvements in modulation techniques, error correction, and the bits per second each carrier could handle, the same physical fibre became exponentially more capable. The key dynamic: supply improvements were exponential while demand was merely linear. While some physical infrastructure needed to be built, there was enormous overbuilding that could mostly be serviced by technology improvements on the same infrastructure. Unlike fibre optics in the 1990s, GPU performance per watt improvements are actually slowing down: 2015-2020 Period: 2020-2025 Period: More tellingly, GPU TDPs (power consumption) are rising dramatically: This is the opposite of what happened in telecoms. We're not seeing exponential efficiency gains that make existing infrastructure obsolete. Instead, we're seeing semiconductor physics hitting fundamental limits. The B200 from NVidia also requires liquid cooling - which means most datacentres designed for air cooling need to be completely retrofitted. The telecoms crash happened partly because demand was overestimated by 4x. What does AI demand growth look like? Traditional LLM Usage: ChatGPT averages 20+ prompts per user per day. Extended conversations can reach 3,000-4,000 tokens cumulative, though many users treat it like Google - short "searches" with no follow-up, consuming surprisingly few tokens. Agent Usage (Anthropic research): We're looking at a fundamentally different demand curve - if anything, people are underestimating how much agents will consume. The shift from chat to agents represents a 10x-100x increase in token consumption per user. We're not even there yet, and infrastructure is already maxed out, with AI infrastructure running at very high utilization rates. Major providers still experience peak-time capacity issues. The problem isn't unused infrastructure sitting idle; it's infrastructure struggling to meet current demand. One major hyperscaler told me they still have capacity issues at peak times causing free tier users to have high error rates. Another important piece of context that gets missed: Pre-AI Growth (2018-2021): AI Boom (2023-2025): While it's no doubt a huge amount of capex going into this rollout; it's not quite as dramatic as some news stories make out. I have no doubt that now any datacentre related capex is being rebranded as "AI", even if it's just 'boring' old compute, storage and network not being directly used for AI. Here's where I think the comparison to telecoms becomes both interesting and concerning. The Lead Time Problem: The Prisoner's Dilemma: The Forecasting Challenge: Imagine you're planning datacenter capacity right now for 2027. You need to make billion-dollar decisions today based on what you think AI usage will look like in three years. Here's scenario one: agent adoption is gradual. Some developers use Claude Code daily. A few enterprises deploy internal agents. Customer service stays mostly human with AI assist. You need maybe 3-4x your current infrastructure. Here's scenario two: agents go mainstream. Every developer has an always-on coding agent consuming millions of tokens per session. Enterprises deploy agents across operations, finance, legal, sales. Customer service becomes 80% agentic with humans handling escalations. You need 30-50x your current infrastructure. Both scenarios are completely plausible. Nobody can tell you which one is right. But you have to commit billions in capex NOW - datacenters take 2-3 years to build, GPU orders have 6-12 month lead times. But here's the really insidious part: even if you're directionally right, small errors compound massively. Let's say you're confident agents are going mainstream and you need roughly 50x growth over 3 years. If actual demand is 40x, you've overbuilt by 25% - billions in excess capacity. If actual demand is 60x, you've underbuilt by 20% - your service degrades and you lose market share. You're trying to hit a moving target in the dark, and the margin of error is measured in tens of billions of dollars and thousands of megawatts of power infrastructure. If you build for scenario one and scenario two happens, your service degrades to unusable, users revolt, and you lose the AI wars to competitors who bet bigger. If you build for scenario two and scenario one happens, you've got billions in underutilized datacenters burning cash. Which mistake would you rather make? This is where the telecoms comparison makes sense: given those choices, rational players overbuild. The difference is what happens to that overcapacity. Let me put this in a table: The telecoms crash happened because exponential supply improvements met linearly growing (and overestimated) demand, with infrastructure that would last decades sitting unused. AI datacenters are facing slowing supply improvements meeting potentially exponentially growing demand. And crucially, because GPU efficiency improvements are slowing down, today's hardware retains value for longer - not shorter - than previous generations. Could there still be a short-term crash? Absolutely. Scenarios that could trigger a correction: 1. Agent adoption hits a wall Enterprises might discover that production agent deployments are harder than demos suggest. Hallucinations in high-stakes workflows, regulatory concerns around autonomous AI systems, or implementation complexity could slow adoption dramatically. If the agent future takes 5-7 years instead of 2-3, there's a painful gap where billions in infrastructure sits waiting for demand to catch up. However, given the explosion in usage for software engineering and other tasks, I suspect this is highly unlikely. You can already use Claude Code for non engineering tasks in professional services and get very impressive results without any industry specific modifications, so I have no doubt there is going to be very high adoption of agents in all kinds of areas. 2. Financial engineering unravels These datacenter buildouts are heavily debt-financed. If credit markets seize up, interest rates spike further, or lenders lose confidence in AI growth projections, the financing model could collapse. This wouldn't be about technical fundamentals - it would be good old-fashioned financial panic, similar to what happened in telecoms when the debt markets froze, but with one key difference - a lot of the key players (Microsoft, Google, Meta, Oracle) are extremely cash flow positive, which definitely wasn't the case in the 2000s fibre boom. The pure datacentre players though are at risk - who don't have a money printing main business to backstop the finance - no doubt about that. 3. Efficiency breakthroughs change the math Model efficiency could improve faster than expected. Or we could see a hardware breakthrough: custom ASICs that are 10x more efficient than GB200s for inference workloads. Either scenario could make current buildouts look excessive. I actually think this is the biggest risk - and this is exactly what happened in the fibre boom. So far, I'm not seeing signs of this though. While specialist ASICs are becoming available, they hit their impressive speed by having huge wafers, which isn't a huge efficiency game (yet). The Key Difference From Telecoms: Even if there's a correction, the underlying dynamics are different. Telecoms built for demand that was 4x overestimated, then watched fiber optic technology improvements make their infrastructure obsolete before it could be utilized. The result: 95% of fiber remained permanently dark. AI datacenters might face a different scenario. If we build for 50x growth and only get 30x over 3 years, that's not "dark infrastructure" - that's just infrastructure that gets utilized on a slower timeline than expected. Unlike fiber optic cable sitting in the ground unused, GPU clusters still serve production workloads, just at lower capacity than planned. And unlike telecoms where exponential technology improvements made old infrastructure worthless, GPU efficiency improvements are slowing. A GB200 deployed today doesn't become obsolete when next year's chip arrives - because that chip is only incrementally better, not 100x better. With process node improvements slowing down, current generation hardware actually retains value for longer. A correction might mean 2-3 years of financial pain, consolidation, and write-downs as demand catches up to capacity. But that's fundamentally different from building infrastructure for demand that never materializes while technology makes it obsolete. I think the real question isn't whether we need massive AI infrastructure - the agent transition alone suggests we do. The question is timing. If enterprises take 5 years to adopt agents at scale instead of 2 years, and hyperscalers have built for the 2-year scenario, you could see a 2-3 year period of overcapacity and financial pain. That might be enough to trigger a correction, layoffs, and consolidation. But unlike telecoms, that overcapacity would likely get absorbed. The telecom fibre mostly stayed dark because technology outpaced it and demand never materialized. AI infrastructure might just be early, not wrong. Are we repeating the telecoms crash with AI datacenters? The fundamentals suggest not, but that doesn't mean there won't be bumps. The key insight people miss when making the telecoms comparison: telecoms had exponential supply improvements meeting linear demand, with 4x overestimated growth assumptions. AI has slowing supply improvements potentially meeting exponential demand growth from the agent transition. The risks are different: But the "too much" in AI's case is more like "3 years of runway instead of 1 year" rather than "95% will never be used." I could be wrong. Maybe agent adoption stalls, maybe model efficiency makes current infrastructure obsolete, maybe there's a breakthrough in GPU architecture that changes everything. But when I look at the numbers, I don't see the same setup as the telecoms crash. The fundamentals are different. That doesn't mean there won't be pain, consolidation, or failures. But comparing this to 2000s telecoms seems like the wrong mental model for what's actually happening. Once a month, max, I send an email with links to recent posts.

There will be more opportunities and slightly improved affordability for buyers and sellers in many markets, but also a wide range of experiences depending on where they live and what they can afford. Based on these dynamics, in 2026 buyers and sellers can expect to see: “The 2026 housing market will be shaped by uncertainty—economic, demographic and regional,” said Lisa Sturtevant, Chief Economist at Bright MLS. “While lower mortgage rates and more inventory will bring some buyers back, this will be a reset year, not a rebound year. Market performance will hinge on local economic conditions, making 2026 one of the most geographically divided markets we’ve seen in years.” Key Trends and Wild Cards for 2026 While national averages provide a framework, local conditions and unexpected factors will shape consumer experiences in 2026.

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. There are, of course, two components to affordability: sellers’ prices and buyers’ incomes. For most American families, buying (or renting) focuses either heavily or entirely on life’s essentials: housing, food, transportation, education, health care, and other forms of care (child, senior). That a clear majority of American families are, at minimum, stressed by these costs is a consequence of not just a host of factors on the sellers’ side, but of one big factor on the buyers’ side: a half-century of wage stagnation, even as investment income has soared. Or, if you prefer, a half-century of buyers’ income stagnation, even as sellers’ income has soared. More from Harold Meyerson If you depend on investments for most of your income, this is a pretty damn good time. The University of Michigan’s November survey of consumer sentiment finds that Americans who don’t own stock have their lowest confidence level in the economy since the survey began querying stock ownership in 1998. An exception to this mood, the survey notes, is found among the largest stock owners, whose assessment of the economy has actually risen by 11 percent this year. As Emma Janssen has reported in these pages, marketers are going where the money is, like bank robber Willie Sutton. First-class and business-seat travel on the airlines is booming, so much so that seating arrangements on Delta and United are being reconfigured to create more room for the affluent, while coach seats are going unfilled and “discount” airlines struggle. Revenues are up 3 percent this year at the Ritz-Carltons, the Four Seasons, and other luxury hotels, yet down by 3 percent at economy hotels. And when it comes to life’s biggest purchase—a home—the median age of first-time buyers reached 40 this year, an all-time high according to the National Association of Realtors. “All right,” as John Dos Passos wrote in his U.S.A. trilogy in the depth of the Depression, “we are two nations.” Life in the nonaffluent nation is getting harder. According to a Brookings Institution analysis from last year, 43 percent of American families don’t earn enough to pay for housing, food, health care, child care, and transportation; every week, they must juggle which to pay and which not to pay. Among Black and Latino families, those figures rise to 59 percent and 66 percent, respectively. The litany of the limits placed on workers’ ability to win sustaining incomes is long. It has not been ever thus. In the roughly 30 years following the end of World War II, the nation experienced an unprecedented period of broadly shared prosperity, with workers’ incomes rising in tandem with the nation’s growth in productivity. In 1947, workers captured 70 percent of the total national income; today, that has fallen to roughly 59 percent, while investment income has gained at workers’ expense. As a landmark 1995 study by economists Larry Mishel and Jared Bernstein for the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) revealed, a gap between the rise in productivity and the rise in median workers’ wages opened in the mid-1970s and has grown steadily wider since then; the difference between those two rates today is 55 percent. In the years between 1948 and 1979, when the egalitarian legacy of the New Deal was at its apogee, with high levels of unionization and progressive taxation and constraints on the financial sector, productivity grew by 108 percent and median worker’s compensation by 93 percent. In the years between 1979 and 2025, an EPI analysis found productivity grew by 87 percent but median worker’s compensation by a bare 33 percent. The declining share of national income going to workers hasn’t entirely been the result of the shift from wage income to investment income. There’s also been a shift in the distribution of corporate income to the most highly paid employees, through stock options and other forms of compensation. A 2021 EPI study shows that between 1979 and 2019, real yearly wages for the bottom 90 percent of workers increased by 26 percent, while the wages of those in the 95th to 99th percentile increased by 75 percent, for those in the top 1 percent by 160 percent, and for those in the top 0.1 percent by 345 percent. Worker pay ratios over the past decade have shown that CEOs usually make about 300 times what their median-paid employee makes, a far cry from the 1960s, when the ratio was roughly 20-to-1. Even as labor unions have largely disappeared in the past 60 years, the union of American CEOs—routinely appointed to the executive compensation committees of corporate boards with the blessing or at the instigation of the CEO whose pay they’re setting—has retained its power, adhering to the creed that an injury to one CEO (by, say, paying him or her less than 300 times what workers make) is an injury to all. What would America look like if the gap between worker pay and productivity hadn’t opened? A RAND Corporation study from earlier this year found that the bottom 90 percent of wage earners received about 67 percent of all taxable income in 1975. In 2019, the last year for which this data was available, they received 46.8 percent. Had that bottom 90 percent continued during the past half-century to make the same share of the national income they’d had in 1975, RAND calculates that by 2023 they would have made an additional $79 trillion. Just in the year 2023, they would have made an additional $3.9 trillion. As the size of the bottom 90 percent of the U.S. workforce is roughly 140 million people, that means that the average earner would have made about $28,000 more in 2023 than they actually did. Where have all those missing $28,000 paychecks gone? Well, our nation was home to 1,135 billionaires this year, whose aggregate net worth in 2024 came to a cozy $5.7 trillion. That’s $1.8 trillion more than what it would take to cut 140 million $28,000 paychecks. Corporations aren’t cutting those checks. As EPI’s Nominal Wage Tracker documents, the 80 percent of corporate income that went to employees in 1980 declined to 71.5 percent this year. This is the kind of thing that can irritate workers. As I write in mid-November, 3,200 members of the Machinists union have just completed a three-month strike at three Midwestern Boeing plants. Strikers noted that Boeing devoted $68 billion to stock buybacks between 2010 and 2024—funds that could have gone to developing safer and better planes, and better-compensated workers with more secure retirement benefits. THERE’S A REASON WHY 1979 HAS BECOME the last “postwar normal” year, before the massive upward redistribution of wealth and income, in most of these economic studies. In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president. In his first few months in office, he signed a law reducing the top income tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. (It’s about ten points lower than that today, though most of our super-rich have found ways to get it much closer to zero.) The high marginal tax rates of the postwar decades, peaking at 91 percent during Republican Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency, had effectively put a ceiling on CEO pay. Tesla’s board would not be committing to pay Elon Musk a trillion bucks if Tesla thrives in the coming years under 1950s-era tax rates, where the feds would take the lion’s share above the top marginal bracket. The pre-Reagan tax rates ensured that America’s billionaires would be few and far between, helping to ensure that workers’ potential income wouldn’t be siphoned upward. Twenty years after Reagan, George W. Bush became the first president to lower taxes on the rich during wartime (a war he decided to start absent a plausible threat), and Donald Trump’s successive cuts make even Reagan and Bush look like Keynesians. In 1982, Reagan’s appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) changed a rule that enabled shareholders to claim a greater percentage of corporate wealth. The SEC permitted corporate executives to authorize buybacks of the corporation’s stock, thereby raising the value of the remaining shares on the market. By the 1990s, due to a Clinton-era loophole exempting bonus compensation from corporate taxes, corporations began paying their top executives with shares and options of shares, which made buybacks an easy form of self-enrichment. As economist William Lazonick has exhaustively documented, by the 2000s, most major corporations were diverting more funds to buybacks and dividends than they were investing in growth and research, not to mention employees’ raises. During his first year in office, Reagan also busted PATCO, the air traffic controllers’ union, firing all its members when they went on strike. (By contrast, Republican Richard Nixon had allowed all hundreds of thousands of postal workers who’d participated in a wildcat strike in 1970 to return to their jobs: The Republican Party of Nixon’s day was still closer to the accept-the-New-Deal ethos of Eisenhower than the overturn-the-New-Deal ethos of Reagan.) Reagan’s mass firing inspired private-sector CEOs to do the same with their own employees. During the next several years, a representative sample of leading corporations—Phelps Dodge, Greyhound Bus, Boise Cascade, International Paper, Hormel meatpacking—all slashed pay to provoke strikes, then fired the strikers and hired their replacements at a fraction of their original salaries. During the years of postwar prosperity, strikes were a routine part of the economic landscape, and a major reason why worker pay constituted a decent share of the national income. After PATCO, they nearly disappeared. The number of major strikes plummeted from 286 a year in the 1960s and 1970s, to 83 a year in the 1980s, to 35 a year in the 1990s, to 20 a year in the 2000s. In recent years, the strike has enjoyed a modest revival—autoworkers and teaching assistants have won higher wages by walking picket lines—but unions have shrunk to the point that the fruits of such victories have limited ripple effects. Reagan wasn’t the sole agent of upward redistribution during this time. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker brought down inflation by raising interest rates so high that people stopped buying cars and construction projects slowed to a trickle. The industrial Midwest never recovered. Between 1979 and 1983, 2.4 million manufacturing jobs vanished. The number of U.S. steelworkers went from 450,000 at the start of the 1980s to 170,000 at decade’s end, even as the wages of those who remained shrank by 17 percent. The decline in auto manufacturing was even more precipitous, from 760,000 employees in 1978 to 490,000 three years later. These were the jobs whose union contracts had set the standard for the nation’s blue-collar workers. Finally, also in 1981, at New York’s Pierre Hotel, Jack Welch, General Electric’s new CEO, delivered a kind of inaugural address, which he titled “Growing Fast in a Slow-Growth Economy.” GE, Welch proclaimed, would shed all its divisions that weren’t number one or number two in their markets. If that meant shedding workers, so be it. All that mattered was pushing the company to pre-eminence, and the measure of a company’s pre-eminence was its stock price. Between late 1980 and 1985, Welch reduced the number of GE employees from 411,000 to 299,000. He cut basic research. The company’s stock price soared. And Welch became the model CEO for a corporate America going fully neoliberal. WHAT THE EARLY 1980S INAUGURATED GREW APACE over the subsequent 40 years. Emboldened by Reagan’s opposition to unions, CEOs and corporate boards routinely directed their companies to violate the laws that had empowered workers to form and join unions. In 2016 and 2017, employers were charged with violating the National Labor Relations Act in 41.5 percent of all unionization campaigns, often by firing workers involved in those campaigns. The penalties for being found guilty of such charges are negligible, and Democrats’ efforts to amend the NLRA so that the penalties actually have some effect on employer conduct have never been able to win the support of the 60 senators required to break a filibuster to enact such amendments. So it is that most unionized private companies were unionized many decades ago, and almost all the major companies that have been created since (including the two largest private-sector employers, Walmart and Amazon) have rebuffed their employees’ unionization efforts through illegal threats and firings. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Even when workers have managed to win unionization, that doesn’t mean they actually are able to bargain a first contract. An EPI study showed that 63 percent of the time during 2018, workers in newly unionized companies hadn’t been able to get their employer to agree to a contract within one year of their unionizing, as there’s no law requiring employers to bargain in a timely fashion. Amazon, for instance, has yet even to begin bargaining with the Staten Island warehouse workers, who decisively voted to join a union to much fanfare back in April of 2022. These are among the factors that explain why the rate of American worker unionization has declined from one-third in the middle of the 20th century to just under 10 percent today, and a bare 6 percent in the private sector. Another factor, both in the shrinking of unions and the shrinking of worker pay, is the move of major corporations’ production facilities from the unionized Northern and Midwestern states to the right-to-work, anti-union South. The spread of Southern pay standards to the rest of the nation—a tale whose protagonist is most certainly Walmart—also served to bring down national pay levels in retail. The late 1970s deregulation of the trucking industry, by effectively negating the Teamsters’ nationwide contract with long-distance trucking companies that had covered nearly half of U.S. truck drivers, proved to be a huge hit to drivers’ incomes, by some estimates cutting them in half. This November’s elections reveal a public that understands the current system isn’t working for them or their neighbors. The litany of the limits placed on workers’ ability to win sustaining incomes is long. Trade deals and offshoring have damaged workers considerably. NAFTA was the nation’s first trade treaty with a low-wage nation (Mexico), and our end-of-the-century trade deal with China greatly exacerbated the depressing effect on American workers’ wages. Both an EPI study and another by MIT’s David Autor and several co-authors independently concluded that such deals lowered the wage of non-college-graduate U.S. workers by 5.6 percent, taking an average bite out of their yearly income of roughly $2,000. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 currently comes to roughly 29 percent of the median full-time worker’s wage. In 1968, the federal minimum wage came to 53 percent of the median full-time worker’s wage. Worker misclassification as independent contractors (as in the cases of Amazon delivery drivers and Uber and Lyft drivers) reduces incomes, exempts workers from wage and hour legislation, and generally means they lack the benefits (such as health insurance) that customarily accrue to corporate employees. EPI’s 2021 study on the factors reducing workers’ income estimated that nine million American workers were then misclassified, reducing their incomes by anywhere from 15 percent to 30 percent. A 2019 study by Brandeis University economist David Weil, who was in charge of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor during the Obama presidency, found that drivers employed directly by UPS, who also worked under a contract with the Teamsters, earned $23.10 an hour, while the “independent contractor” drivers for FedEx earned $14.40 an hour, and those for Amazon, a paltry $5.30 an hour. Amazon is currently in court contesting the unionization of a number of those drivers, making the argument that the 90-year-old National Labor Relations Board is unconstitutional. Noncompete agreements tucked into employment contracts forbid workers from taking a job with other businesses in the same sector or starting their own businesses in that sector. Initially devised to keep a small number of specialized employees from taking proprietary information to competitor companies, these agreements have now spread to workers at nail salons, barbershops, and just about any other kind of business. An EPI survey of businesses with at least 50 employees found that somewhere between one-quarter and one-half of all private-sector workers were subject to noncompetes. During the Biden presidency, both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the NLRB found this practice to be a violation of law, and the FTC formally banned noncompetes nationwide. But those findings and rules have not been carried over, of course, to their Trump administration successors. Corporate concentration, as the other feature articles in this issue abundantly document, is a huge factor in price increases afflicting the American consumer. It’s also a factor in limiting American workers’ incomes. In 2017, MIT’s Autor and other co-authors estimated that the increase in product market concentration accounted for a third of the decline in labor’s share of the national income for the years between 1997 and 2012. The shrinking of employer options relieves employers of the pressure created by workers flocking to higher-paying rivals. In opposing the merger of the Albertsons and Kroger supermarket chains, Biden’s FTC argued that it would lead not only to price hikes but also to lower wages for their workers unless they remained separate companies. In weighing the relative responsibility of all these factors in creating the widening gap between productivity increases and median wage increases from 1979 through 2017, a 2021 EPI study by Lawrence Mishel and Josh Bivens concluded that excessive unemployment levels (due chiefly to Federal Reserve policies), the decline of collective bargaining, and globalization (devised by and benefiting corporations) explain roughly 55 percent of that gap, while misclassification of workers, subcontracting, noncompete agreements, and corporate concentration add up to 20 percent. OVER THE PAST 45 YEARS, THE FUNDAMENTALS of the postwar economy that were put in place by the New Deal have been discarded at the behest and insistence of wealthy interests and individuals who’ve sought a much higher share of the national income. Creating a more equitable economy—effectively, reinventing a vibrant American middle class—will be an arduous task. That said, this November’s elections reveal a public that understands the current system isn’t working for them or their neighbors. The affordability solutions put forth by Zohran Mamdani, Abigail Spanberger, and Mikie Sherrill in their successful campaigns are just a start in what will be a long and difficult struggle. Herewith, some suggestions on the path to a more broadly shared prosperity and an affordable future. First, nothing increases worker bargaining power like full employment. The next Democratic president’s appointees to the Federal Reserve must be committed to raising ordinary Americans’ share of the national income. That requires the low interest rates essential for a thriving economy. Denmark’s policy of providing free job training and up to 90 percent of their salary to laid-off workers has been a success in boosting that nation’s employment levels and mitigating the effects of an economic downturn. Second, the return of collective bargaining. That necessitates labor law reforms that enable workers to unionize by signing affiliation cards; require employers to recognize unions when their workers have obtained those cards from a majority of employees; require employers to settle on contracts with unionized workers within a fixed time (90 days? 120 days?) or submit to compulsory arbitration; abolish “right to work” laws; make corporations the co-employers of record with their franchises; enable sector-wide bargaining in various sectors, thereby setting the same minimum wage and benefit standards for all of that industry’s employees, unionized or not; and perhaps enable bargaining from “minority” unions to which at least 25 percent of employees belong, so long as no union has achieved majority status. Today, unions are among the most well-thought-of American institutions, getting roughly 70 percent approval ratings in the annual Gallup polls, even as the rate of private-sector unionization is less than one-tenth of that. It’s primarily the weakness of labor law that has spawned this widest of gaps; that law must be changed if that gap is to shrink. Third, raise the minimum wage to the level of a living wage, sufficient to pay for all life’s essentials. An MIT study this year has estimated the living wage for a family in each of the 50 states, from $22.43 an hour in Mississippi to $34.55 in California. A federal law could mandate such procedures for the states. A paper released in October by California-based economists Martin Carnoy, Michael Reich, and Derek Shearer suggests an anti-inflationary accompaniment to such raises would be a rigorous antitrust policy that would yield more competitive pricing in retailing. Fourth, family-friendly financial policies. That could begin with a yearly federal payment to families with children, at an initial level of $5,000 per child. A Brookings Institution study has estimated that a middle-income family spends $310,605 to raise one child from birth to 17. The cost of child-rearing is such that it simply deters many families from having children. This is an area where our government must adopt the kind of policies that the governments of most nations with advanced economies have long since enacted. Universal free child care and pre-kindergarten could cut these costs to families, as well as enabling mothers to continue in their careers, which boosts family incomes. In a recent paper for the Economic Security Project, Becky Chao and Mike Konczal document that Americans generally become parents when their earnings have yet to achieve mid-career levels, making the prospect of having children a financially fraught one. They argue for substantial child tax credits and earned income tax credits to address this structural gap between the costs of parenting and the income levels of young workers. Similarly, they also argue for more generous Social Security payments for the elderly and disabled. Fifth, a ban on noncompete and forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Sixth, the adoption of industrial policies, such as those advanced during the Biden administration, that revitalize domestic industries and lessen our dependence on imports from low-wage nations that have the effect of reducing the incomes of workers here at home. As the robotization of production work continues, manufacturing and transportation will employ fewer workers than they currently do, but the remaining workers in those sectors should not have their incomes reduced either by foreign competition or by the kinds of employment arrangements and opposition to unions that currently characterize our economy. Where unions have power, they can insist that smaller workforces receive the benefits of higher productivity, as the longshore unions have succeeded in doing during the past decades of mechanization and containerization, making their members’ jobs the highest-paying blue-collar jobs in America. Seventh, a thorough reworking of our tax system. Higher taxes on the rich and corporations are clearly needed to fund the kind of programs listed above, and with the nation’s wealth disparities reaching stratospheric proportions, some form of wealth taxes must be adopted as well. The best argument for adopting such a tax is that right now, only the most common and widely held form of wealth—homes—is subjected to that kind of tax. If we can tax the wealth of middle-income families, why can’t we tax the wealth—such as stocks and other investments—of the truly wealthy? Certainly, the capital gains tax should be raised to the level of the income tax on work, and the SEC rule on buybacks should be revoked. None of this will happen so long as money dominates our politics, so the Supreme Court decisions enabling that domination—Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo—should be undone, if not by Democratic-appointed successors to the current justices, then by other work-arounds, such as the current effort in Montana to rewrite the state’s corporate charters so they deny corporations the power to involve themselves in elections. Americans increasingly understand that our current economy isn’t meeting their interests and that it’s rigged to favor the wealthy. A sizable public will welcome candidates who expand the Overton window of economic reforms such as those suggested here, just as there were sizable publics that backed the reforms laid out by Bernie Sanders and Zohran Mamdani in their campaigns. Indeed, a national YouGov poll taken one week after Mamdani’s election showed that every one of his platform planks commanded majority support from the American people, including 69 percent support for raising taxes on corporations and millionaires, 66 percent support for free child care for children from six months to five years, and even 57 percent support for government-owned grocery stores. There’s no reason why Democrats who don’t call themselves socialists can’t do well running on such reforms. This would be a very opportune time for them to start.

Title: Betrayed American workers expose dark underbelly of H-1B visa scheme

By Jason Hopkins, Daily Caller News Foundation December 2, 2025 They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,’” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Title: Betrayed American Workers Expose Dark Underbelly Of H-1B Visa Scheme

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/02/2025 8:23:31 AM PST by DFG They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State.

Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program.

About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF.

Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1.

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program.

Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point.

The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1.

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

Title: Why Morgan Stanley just got more bullish on Nvidia stock, even as it struggles

Nvidia has been under pressure in recent weeks amid a rethink of the AI trade, but one top bank says investors don't have much of a reason to worry about the chip king. Nvidia stock is down 9% over the last month. Even its blockbuster third-quarter earnings failed to generate new excitement for the company and the broader AI sector. Big-name investors like Peter Thiel and SoftBank have dumped the stock, adding pressure. But Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore this week pushed back on the downbeat narratives, increasing the bank's price target for the stock to $250 from $235 on Monday. The new target is among the highest on Wall Street, and implies a nearly 40% jump from current levels. Moore said that he thinks threats to the AI leader's market share, specifically those in Asian markets, are overstated. Speculation that Nvidia's dominance in the AI market may be threatened isn't new. Ever since the AI leader shot to the top of the tech sector following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investors have wondered how long it can maintain the rank as the top AI hardware maker. Morgan Stanley doesn't see any other chipmakers as posing a significant threat to Nvidia, though, even as China prioritizes building out its own domestic semiconductor supply chain. The analysts recently visited Asia and shared their take on why Nvidia shouldn't be worried about competition from the east. "While there is much attention being paid to Chinese AI solutions, we think that they are very limited on multiple levels, including cluster size and scale out technologies, and China software still would like access to western solutions," the analysts stated in a note on Monday. Moore also said his team reconciled the ambitious $500 billion estimate for chip revenue given by CEO Jensen Huang at Nvidia's GTC event in October. "Having met with several contacts in both Asia and in the US, we are comfortable increasing estimates to get revenues to that level." While the analysts increased their price targets for both Nvidia and fellow chipmaker Broadcom, they said they still see Nvidia as the sector's clear winner. "We model for AVGO and AMD to grow their AI processor revenues slightly faster than NVDA in CY26, but that mostly just reflects supply chain limitations of a $205 bn run rate revenue stream - all key products are supply constrained through 2026," the note stated. The analysts are convinced that even as competition in the AI chip market intensifies, Nvidia will still maintain the best performance-to-cost ratio and be able to access a wider range of AI applications and workloads than its competitors.

Title: Betrayed American Workers Expose Dark Underbelly Of H-1B Visa Scheme

They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” (RELATED: Major Democrat Donor Has Sizeable Stake In Pot Company Raided By ICE) “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY – AUGUST 08: An employee works in a 3-D scan lab at GE Appliances on August 08, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo by Michael Hickey/Getty Images for GE Appliances, a Haier company) Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. WASHINGTON, DC – SEPTEMBER 19: President Donald Trump holds up an executive order establishing the “Trump Gold Card” in the Oval Office at the White House on September 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Title: Warner Bros.’ Bidding War Escalates: Here Are the Challenges Facing Comcast, Netflix and Paramount | Analysis

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The three companies are in hot pursuit for all or part of Warner Bros. Discovery, but they each have their own regulatory and political hurdles As Warner Bros. Discovery’s board mulls over a second round of bids from Paramount, Comcast and Netflix, a factor it’ll have to consider is just how easily a deal will get approved by regulators. That was the crux of a lot of the chatter that emerged in the days leading up to the Monday deadline, which saw the three companies submitting new, binding offers for all or parts of Warner Bros. Discovery, according to various press reports. Netflix showing strong interest in WBD’s assets, including making a mostly cash offer to acquire them, coincided with reports that the White House had antitrust concerns, while Comcast, which also submitted a bid, still has to deal with the challenge that President Donald Trump loathes CEO Brian Roberts. Paramount also reportedly sweetened its bid with a reported all-cash offer financed by asset management firm Apollo Group and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and is selling itself as the easiest path to getting its deal done thanks to CEO David Ellison and his father’s cushy relationship with Trump. The new round of bids and the chatter signals how the stakes have gone up in the race for WBD. The winner would gain valuable streaming, IP and studio assets and, in the case of Paramount, also expand its cable TV footprint. Any of the three scenarios will lead to a massive reshaping of the entertainment industry and a further consolidation of power in Hollywood. TheWrap previously reported that a final decision is expected to be made around Christmas. Netflix and Paramount declined to comment, although a Paramount representative did not respond to a later request for a comment on the prospect of the sovereign wealth funds participating, which TheWrap previously reported on. Representatives for Warner Bros. and Comcast did not immediately return a request for comment. Until then, here’s a rundown of where each bidder stands and some of the regulatory challenges they each face. Out of all the players, Paramount Skydance would have the easiest time acquiring WBD, mostly because it has already played this game. The company is fresh off Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, which cleared in August. Since it already secured FCC approval from the Trump administration before, several experts, including LightShed Partners partner and technology analyst Rich Greenfield, have noted that the previous acquisition puts Paramount on the regulatory “fast track.” Another thing working in Paramount’s favor is its interest in the company overall as well as its deep pockets. Out of the three companies interested in bidding on Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount is the only one that wants the full company and not just the Warner Bros. studio and streaming division. Yep, it wants cable too. Paramount noted it would increase the amount paid in cash to shareholders from 60% to 80%, bumping up the breakup fee from $2 billion to $2.1 billion. It’s also clear that Paramount really really wants this. Whereas Comcast and Netflix only submitted one previous bid, this marks Paramount Skydance’s fourth bid. The first three were rejected for being too low. Additionally, Zaslav may be personally interested in selling to Paramount. CEO Ellison offered Zaslav a co-CEO and co-chairman title as part of his Warner offer. So what’s working against Paramount? Concerns over the theatrical division will be a hurdle, since Paramount acquiring WBD will drop the number of major film studios from five to four. But perhaps the main obstacle to clear is one that can’t be measured by hard financial figures. It’s only been four months since Ellison took control of Paramount. So far, the only things to come out of that acquisition have been a lot of layoffs and departures (bye, over 1,000 employees and gone-in-2028 Taylor Sheridan) as well as several headline grabbing deals (“South Park” and UFC’s deals are in the billions). Simply put, it’s way too early to know if the Ellison era is a good — and lucrative — era of the company. Despite the creative-friendly reputation Ellison has in the industry, that’s sure to be a concern. At first glance, Comcast taking over Warner Bros. makes the most sense. Both companies house legacy Hollywood institutions — NBCUniversal and Warner Bros., respectively. Thanks to its movie studio arm, Comcast understands the challenges of theatrical, and because of Peacock, it understands the headaches around streaming. Comcast is also reportedly the preferred option for WBD head Zaslav. Two struggling giants teaming up to combat this difficult landscape is a matchup that works, like Godzilla and King Kong teaming up to take down the Skar King (IP, folks!). The problems come down to money, possible theatrical overreach and Trump. It’s widely believed that Comcast’s pockets aren’t as deep as the Ellison family’s Oracle-powered fortune. That being said, according to the New York Post, Comcast CEO Roberts was considering a potential offer that could reach as high as $28 a share for just the studio and streaming business. As for the theatrical side of the business, Comcast will face the same questions as Paramount. At the moment, there are only five major movie studios: Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures. Two of them being owned by the same company will raise some regulatory eyebrows no matter which companies are involved. Other than cash, it’s the Trump administration that may also pose a major threat to Comcast scooping up Warner Bros. The president has been outspoken about his dislike of Roberts, calling the CEO “a disgrace to the integrity of broadcasting” on Truth Social. Though NBCUniversal will be spinning its cable assets off into Versant sometime early next year, Comcast’s ownership of MSNBC (now MS NOW) could rub Trump the wrong way. Comcast also owns NBC, which is home to Seth Meyers’ “Late Night,” which last month drew Trump’s ire as he called for the host to be fired. As the “60 Minutes” lawsuit ahead of Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount demonstrated, Trump isn’t above dangling FCC approval to make major media networks act the way he wants. Like Comcast, Netflix only wants Warner Bros., which encompasses Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming and studio divisions. Let’s start with the positives. Warner Bros. Discovery has warmed up to Netflix’s potential bid, Gasparino reported. Netflix has always had a healthy respect for Warner. Way back in 2012, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos famously said, “We’re going to become HBO before HBO could become us.” Acquiring the company behind HBO — especially during a time when Netflix is interested in “selective” merger and acquisition deals — would be a big step in that direction. Netflix also has deep pockets and has proven it’s willing to overspend to get what it wants. But that’s about where the pro-Netflix argument ends. Because Netflix is notoriously against showing movies in theaters, its interest in acquiring one of the five big movie studios has ruffled the feathers of many in the industry, especially since theater attendance is down nearly 50% compared to pre-pandemic levels. If Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros., it’s hard to say whether it would abandon its current strategy and lean into theaters or if it would continue to make its movies streaming-first. And if Netflix did lean into theaters, that leads to a whole other set of issues. Netflix would have to learn the international theatrical ropes in a very short amount of time. But the biggest argument against Netflix is that it’s simply too big. Netflix is consistently the top premium streamer when it comes to Nielsen’s monthly The Gauge reports. If it were to acquire HBO Max as well, the ensuing streamer would be an even bigger behemoth in a landscape where it dominates. Government officials are already thinking about antitrust concerns if there is a Netflix acquisition. That potential investigation has been compared to the lengthy antitrust investigations Google and Amazon underwent and that Netflix has avoided so far. Overcoming those regulatory hurdles from the Department of Justice would likely take more than two years before it even goes to court, according to the New York Post. It’s unclear if Netflix or Warner Bros. would want to undergo this joint headache. Ironically, what could save Netflix is YouTube. If the case can be made that YouTube, which consistently leads the Nielsen charts, is the actual entertainment leader, Netflix may be able to acquire Warner Bros. without antitrust concerns. It just comes down to how well YouTube’s user-generated content can be separated from Netflix’s premium content.

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Earlier this year, a slightly balding man in spectacles, a black T-shirt, and bright high-top sneakers gave a presentation about how his computer can predict what you want to buy. His name is Dr. Uri Yerushalmi, co-founder and chief artificial intelligence officer of Fetcherr, an Israeli-based pricing consultant used by a half dozen airlines around the world. “While most of us in the AI community have been focusing on building models that are generating either text or image, in Fetcherr we have been focusing during the last five years on building large market models,” Yerushalmi said. Trained on years of market data—prices, orders, competitors, regulation, stock prices, even the weather—Fetcherr’s “business agents” aim to simulate market dynamics, assist pricing analysts, and even automatically price tickets. More from David Dayen One presentation slide stuck out. It showed price fluctuations before the use of Fetcherr’s system and after. In the before graph, prices are relatively static and straight. After Fetcherr, the jagged lines pulse with staccato rhythms. “The dynamic is much more similar to dynamics in NASDAQ or capital markets where the prices change much more frequently,” said Yerushalmi, “because every time something in the market changes, there is an immediate response.” Yerushalmi once ran AI for a high-speed stock trading firm. He approaches pricing like a science experiment, engaging in constant real-time testing and tweaking to maximize corporate profits. Fetcherr boasts of delivering annual “revenue uplift” of over 10 percent. The guinea pigs for these tests, the ones being separated from their cash, are you and me. AI can depict you as an anime character. It can respond half-intelligently to questions about the Franco-Prussian War or concentrations of sulfur in the upper atmosphere. It can delight and distract and maybe help you get work done. But none of that is as prized by corporate America as its data-driven approach to the previously conjectural world of pricing. Supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. “That’s the use case they don’t want you to talk about. That’s why we’re building all these data centers,” said Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project. “As we have built social media platforms that shape the flow of information across society, now we are building the platforms that control the flow of money.” Technology-fueled pricing is more widespread than once thought, presenting serious policy challenges in an age where affordability is on everyone’s minds. AI bots are colluding with one another, anticipating consumer choices, and accumulating surplus—that is, transferring wealth—for the businesses that employ them. It’s part of why corporate profits hit record highs after the pandemic and have stayed there. The public recoils at the thought of seeing prices tick up based on when they like to get lunch or what device they’re using. When Delta, which employs Fetcherr as a pricing agent, announced on an earnings call this summer that up to 20 percent of its flights would be priced using AI by the end of the year, the outcry was so intense that the company claimed its critics were peddling “misinformation.” Policymakers and advocates have united to crack down on some tactics, winning real legislative victories from coast to coast. But every step government takes can be countered by AI price-setters. How can consumers keep up? “What worries me is that it will become hyperefficient to price discriminate and to charge more in ways that ordinary people will not be able to combat,” said Doha Mekki, the top deputy at the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division under Joe Biden. “And it will make a very bad cost-of-living crisis even worse.” A YEAR AGO, I WROTE ABOUT WHAT I TERMED surveillance pricing: companies offering individualized prices based on personal data. The idea was that a business equipped with granular information about demographics, purchase history, social and financial interactions, or even medical status could exploit a customer’s willingness to pay. Uber could charge more when a rider booked on a company credit card; people aren’t as price-sensitive when someone else is paying. Delta could jack up fares after learning that a traveler needs to attend a funeral; desperation could translate into opportunity. I couldn’t be certain how many businesses used surveillance pricing. The proliferation of third-party pricing consultants touting “digital pricing transformations” seemed like a strong indicator. But concealment was key to the strategy, to minimize the anger generated by charging different prices to different people. For instance, when a reporter at SFGate logged in to hotel booking platforms using his regular IP address in high-wage San Francisco, he received a quote of $829 a night. But when he used a virtual private network set up to originate from Phoenix or Kansas City, prices were more than $500 less. Without a public price, it takes research to understand if someone is being ripped off. A month after my report, Lina Khan’s Federal Trade Commission announced an investigation into surveillance pricing, seeking information from eight third-party consultants. The agency only had a short time to conduct the study before the changeover of power in Washington. But days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, it issued “research summaries” of the work done thus far. (Trump’s FTC has yet to finish the study.) Stephanie Nguyen, the FTC’s chief technologist under Khan, told me those eight pricing consultants were working with over 250 clients, suggesting broad reach across the economy. Services included individually targeted pricing, segmentation of customers based on their profiles, and ranking tools that alter what products people see atop a web page or search. A customer clicking on fast shipping, for example, suggests an urgency that would lead them to tolerate higher prices. The key to surveillance pricing is data. Nguyen and Sam Levine, the FTC’s former head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, recently wrote a paper about how customers deliver that data when they sign up for loyalty programs. Enticed by promised discounts and concierge treatment, customers consent to data collection that allows companies to build intricate social graphs; one customer profile created by the grocery chain Kroger stretched to 62 pages. The discounts often aren’t maintained or are curtailed, loyalty card fees expand over time, and the more loyal a customer, the more data is collected and the more they pay over time, according to the report. One case study is the McDonald’s app, which has 185 million users and provides seamless access on smartphones, our personal data-spewing machines. According to a recent earnings call, after downloading the app, a customer goes from 10.5 annual McDonald’s visits on average to 26. McDonald’s clearly wants its customers on the app. Its popular Monopoly game gives out stickers on the packaging of items like Big Macs and fries; you collect the right ones to win big prizes. But this year, instead of filling out a physical game board, Monopoly pieces now must be scanned into the app. “This is about taxing people who don’t turn over their data, and manipulating people who do,” Levine said. “Do we really want a world in which you will have to pay a premium if you want to shop anonymously?” Surveillance pricing is just one technology that companies use to set prices. Surge pricing accelerates supply and demand to raise prices when more people want the product or service. Subscription pricing offers products for a monthly fee, a steady stream of revenue from absent-minded customers that can feature deceptive sign-ups and impossible cancellation policies. Trump’s FTC sued Uber for a subscription service that takes as many as 23 screens and 32 actions to cancel; Amazon Prime’s cancellation policy, the subject of a separate FTC settlement that cost the company $2.5 billion, was internally nicknamed “Iliad Flow,” like the tortuous war Odysseus waged in the Greek epic. Electronic shelf tags at Walmart and other grocers have triggered fears of endlessly changing prices while you shop. FIFA has confirmed use of differential pricing for World Cup events based on demand, something New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has criticized. “They can become a tool for pure extraction and leave everybody paying what they shouldn’t,” said Kevin Erickson of the Future of Music Coalition, which monitors event ticketing. One of the most insidious uses of technology is on the wage side. An issue brief from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth focused on how companies are using personal data to set worker pay, something first seen in the ride-hailing industry. Twenty AI consultants offer surveillance wage services to clients in logistics, manufacturing, retail, finance, education, transportation, technology, and health care, which is “the new Uber in a lot of ways,” said Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California and co-author of the report. The AI systems can adjust worker pay in real time, and offer different wages to people doing the same work. They can adjust wages based on performance data, customer feedback, and even factors off the job, such as “predictive analytics that attempt to determine a worker’s potential tolerance for low pay,” the report notes. Most of these wage-setting practices are opaque to workers or their bargaining representatives. “This is becoming normalized,” Dubal said. “It fundamentally undermines the well-worn and very American idea that hard work should result in higher pay.” The result of these strategies is that supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. AI-based pricing has become more critical than sale volume or product quality. Customers seeking a fair deal are simply outworked, unable to avoid being targeted. “There used to be moments where you really blew it, you had to buy a last-minute airline ticket and they’ve got you,” said Tim Wu, former competition policy chief in the Biden White House. “That’s really daily life now.” Consumers used to benefit from what economists would call imperfect information. The uncertainty of defining the optimal price, and the ability in open markets for new businesses to undercut competitors, gave consumers a fighting chance to get a deal, or just to manage their life without being tracked and prodded. Technology eliminates that information inefficiency. “What these technologies are about is eliminating all risk for the shareholder,” Hepner said. “There’s no more error. It is a well-oiled extraction machine.” EVEN ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN SURPRISED by the furiousness of the response to technology-aided pricing. As post-pandemic inflation swelled, AI trickery was a tangible, easy-to-understand depiction of an economy rigged against ordinary people, and the lack of transparency and unpredictability vexed consumers. “It was hiding in plain sight and everyone has found it and you just can’t unsee it,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative. Politicians looking for anti-inflation messaging rode the wave of constituent anger. Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) challenged Delta’s palpable glee over surveillance pricing in an earnings call, and when Delta responded that they wouldn’t actually target customers using their personal data, Gallego didn’t let up. After all, Delta’s president Glen Hauenstein said on the earnings call that “to get [travelers] the right offer in your hand at the right time” is the “Holy Grail,” which sure sounds like surveillance pricing. “Delta is telling their investors one thing, and then turning around and telling the public another,” Gallego said in a statement. House Democrats proposed a bill to ban surveillance pricing and surveillance wage-setting. So-called “drip pricing,” where junk fees are added during a sale, was effectively banned in event ticketing and hotel stays by an FTC rule finalized in May. But with GOP control of Washington, the real action has moved to the states. Surveillance pricing bans were introduced in California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota; surge pricing bans for grocery stores and restaurants were introduced in New York and Maine. By July, 24 states had seen bills introduced over some form of technology-aided pricing, according to a tracker from Consumer Reports. In a major win this year, the nation’s two largest blue states explicitly banned algorithmic price-fixing, a tactic famously used by RealPage, which aggregated data from landlords across a city and recommended coordinated rent hikes. Joe Biden’s Justice Department sued RealPage, reaching settlements with corporate landlords vowing to end the practice. But data aggregators like Agri Stats and PotatoTrac already do this for meat and produce, and states wanted to prevent tech-enabled collusion from expanding. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Advocates were pushing on an open door; housing is the biggest monthly expense people have. “When RealPage came out, it quickly mapped onto something people feel viscerally,” said Samantha Gordon, chief advocacy officer at TechEquity, which lobbied on the California tech pricing bills. Moreover, since price-fixing is illegal when human beings enter a smoke-filled room and collude, extending that to algorithmic collusion made sense to lawmakers. That was the concept behind California’s AB 325, which states that “common pricing algorithms,” whether informed through public or nonpublic competitor data, violate the Cartwright Act, California’s antitrust law. The law lowers the evidence standard to prove an algorithmic pricing conspiracy. It also prohibits anyone from distributing a pricing tool that coerces the setting of a recommended price, protecting small businesses along with consumers, explained Hepner, who was active in drafting the bill. “We saw mom-and-pop businesses swept up into these pricing schemes,” he said. “If you want to get the buy box on Amazon, you have to use their smart pricing tool. You have to give up independent decision-making authority to participate in the economy.” After seven rounds of amendments, AB 325 passed and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed it in October. Days later, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) signed S.7882, another prohibition on coordinated price-fixing via software, though limited to rental housing. The New York law also blocks landlords from using algorithms to set “lease renewal terms, ideal occupancy levels, or other lease terms and conditions.” Cities like Jersey City, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Seattle have enacted similar citywide collusion bans, and 51 algorithmic price-fixing bills were introduced nationwide in just the 2025 legislative session. It’s “a potentially very powerful first step in tilting some of this economy back in favor of consumers,” Hepner said. The best way to get at surveillance pricing might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. Surveillance pricing bills have not seen the same success, though their failure revealed critical information. In California, AB 446, which would have banned pricing based on personal data, was held back, giving sponsors time to build support next year. That’s because businesses across the economy, even ones not suspected of surveillance pricing, swarmed Sacramento to defend their practices. “It was fascinating over the course of that legislative process to see the opposition come out and openly say, ‘Hey, we’re actually doing this, you mean we can’t do this anymore?’” Hepner told me. Some economists allege that tech pricing crackdowns threaten discounts and other potential benefits for consumers. But it’s hard to believe that companies would hire the most sophisticated engineers to figure out how to reduce their revenues. As Nguyen told me, the argument to preserve discounts boils down to this: “You can have privacy or low prices, but you can’t have both.” A modest breakthrough came in New York, which passed a disclosure law requiring that relevant transactions include a pop-up stating: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” The National Retail Federation sued to block the law, but in October, a federal judge dismissed the case, ruling that the disclaimer “is plainly factual.” Advocates believe that the legal victory will give policymakers permission to revisit the topic. But the fierce pushback showed that AI-based pricing was no longer a speculative harm. “So many companies and industries trying to kill [surveillance pricing bans] told us everything we need to know on why everything is getting more and more expensive,” Gordon concluded. RealPage got the message as well. As the price-fixing bills worked their way through statehouses, the company announced it was acquiring Livble, a property management software tool. With Livble integrated into their platform, RealPage said, residents could subdivide rental payments into installments based on real-time cash flow landlords can see. In other words, RealPage was trying out surveillance pricing. THESE TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFTS FROM ONE SCHEME to the next make it difficult for policymakers to stay ahead of the curve. For example, Lyft, one of the early adopters of surge pricing, reacted to rider anger about the service being more expensive precisely when they needed it most by moving to something called Price Lock, a subscription-based pricing tool that caps fares on targeted routes—for a monthly fee. Another tactic involves redefining basic terms. When Delta claimed it would not use personal data, it added that it was merely “enhanc[ing] our existing fare pricing processes” with AI. “The lack of regulations about this and the way people’s data can be collected and used allows them to play around with what they are calling personal data and use,” said Ben Winters, director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America. This forces policymakers to think more broadly, even on the outer edges of the possible. “I do worry that we’re always going to be chasing the companies,” said Sam Levine. “I think companies need to advertise a price publicly that’s available to all consumers … there should be a basic principle to advertise a price and it’s deceptive to charge more than that.” Levine’s testimony to Congress this summer hits on another option: limiting collection of personal data, rather than just its usage. “‘Surveillance pricing’ is only possible because of how companies collect, share, and weaponize our personal data,” he told lawmakers, while arguing that relying on outdated tools to safeguard privacy risked further abuse. Consumer protection and anti-monopoly experts are warming to this idea of cutting the data off at the source. Companies, after all, provide a full road map of what they collect in the privacy policies almost nobody reads. Levine and Nguyen’s loyalty program paper documents privacy policies, finding that rental car giant Hertz admits to collecting demographic and behavioral data, Home Depot tracks Wi-Fi usage inside their stores, and Macy’s captures customer driver’s licenses. Much of this data is sold to third-party data brokers, who share it with other businesses. A data minimization standard could prevent use of personal information for pricing, Winters suggested. Mekki added that antitrust law recognizes that antitrust remedies often call for disgorgement of whatever gives companies an unfair advantage in the marketplace. Applied to surveillance pricing, that would argue for destroying the data allowing them to price-set. “If you can be forced to give up money or property, it stands to reason that you need to give up data,” she said. The bipartisan American Privacy Rights Act introduced last year would have limited collection of certain kinds of data and given people the ability to opt out of having their data used to target them or sold to third parties. But this is at least the third major comprehensive privacy bill in the internet era that’s gone nowhere in Congress; too many companies are invested in the surveillance economy to let it be legislated out of existence. “This is a textbook example of people not getting what they want,” said Wu, whose recent book The Age of Extraction highlights Big Tech platform-ization multiplying across the economy. “Is there anyone in America who wants less privacy or thinks it’s fine, or really wants targeted ads? The constituency is zero … In 20 years of privacy laws, there hasn’t been a single vote. This is not even a conspiracy. The tech industry lobbyists specialize in one thing: killing privacy laws.” Some states have fared better, with a dozen passing limitations on data collection or letting consumers opt out of targeted ads or sale of personal data. California updated its policy this legislative session by passing AB 566, which allows internet users to opt out of data collection at the browser level, rather than having to go website by website. But practically all privacy legislation has carve-outs for “bona fide loyalty programs,” giving companies an escape hatch under the guise of offering discounts. Even given that, however, loyalty programs are not exempt from “excessive” collection under these statutes that is not reasonably necessary. Maryland recently finalized a privacy law that prevents companies from conditioning loyalty programs on the sale of data, despite industry pushback. The best way to get at this activity might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. That includes companies acting as data brokers by selling and trading data, and the third-party pricing consultants they share the data with. Data sales could be considered unfair or deceptive under state consumer protection laws. And even when customers consent to having their data collected, they may not be consenting to transferring that data to third parties. “State enforcers should be thinking, under what circumstances is it lawful for companies to share personal data with pricing consultants?” Levine said. Under Lina Khan, the FTC made headway by looking at these agglomerations of data as unfair practices, and subsequently prohibiting the sale of sensitive data, like when someone visits an abortion clinic. Today’s FTC has walked away from this enforcement, but their past work outlines a path for states to argue that targeted pricing is similarly unfair. AI PRICING WON’T LOOK THE SAME IN FIVE YEARS as it does now, but we have hints of where it’s going. That’s why the role of Fetcherr is more interesting than Delta’s meandering explanations for how it uses AI. Airlines have been at the forefront of every pricing innovation of the past 30 years, from junk fees to differential pricing to loyalty programs. What’s the next frontier? Fetcherr, which closed $90 million in funding in 2024 and another $42 million this year, tells you right on its website: “hyper-personalization at scale.” (Or at least, it used to tell you that, before it scrubbed this section.) “We’re talking about understanding each customer as an individual, optimizing every interaction for maximum value,” the now-redacted section states, detailing how its AI model uses data points like “customer lifetime value, past purchase behaviors, and the real-time context of each booking inquiry” to give each passenger their own product bundle at a bespoke price. The goal isn’t just a pleasant customer experience—it’s “revenue growth.” Robby Nissan, a Fetcherr co-founder, has said publicly that its AI systems can “manipulat[e] the market in order to gain more profit.” There’s not a lot of mystery here. There are other airline pricing consultants, like Peter Thiel–backed FLYR and PROS and Air Price IQ. But the pitch is the same: maximizing travelers’ willingness to pay by analyzing reams of data. If you want to see the dystopia of perfect information accurately predicting exactly how much you’ll pay for a service, just book a flight this Christmas. “It’s a very real example of how AI-based pricing schemes put consumers into economic silos,” Hepner said. “You cannot comparison shop anymore. You cannot predict what a price is supposed to be anymore.” This is facilitated by a concentrated economy where markets aren’t as open to alternatives to AI-optimized schemes. But AI pricing may shrink choice even further. For example, Delta recently stopped flying from LAX to London Heathrow Airport, despite the popularity of the route. Virgin Atlantic still makes the LAX-Heathrow trip; it’s a joint venture partner with Delta, and perhaps as important, both of them use Fetcherr. Was canceling the route an AI-enabled suggestion to benefit another client? We will never know. Large market models running millions of price tests with thousands of input signals could short-circuit restrictions on surveillance pricing or data minimization. If it’s all just simulations, after all, is it really using personal data? Another future is glimpsed in the rise of AI agents that shop for you. ChatGPT users will soon be able to link their PayPal accounts for instant purchases based on chatbot recommendations. Walmart has partnered with OpenAI for e-commerce as well. Autonomous bots with a linked bank account could even shop on their own, something a new AI agent lobby is trying to facilitate in Washington. There’s little transparency on how products are recommended, how prices are derived, or whether AI agents will act in the interest of consumers or the retailers they’re partnering with. “You’re delegating purchasing power to one algorithm to interface with another,” said Ben Winters. “You’re getting people signed up into these systems where they have no control.” But there’s also a brighter future possible, one where the backlash to nonstop data collection and pricing subterfuge accelerates, and people simply demand a fair price. Polling shows that the public is deeply skeptical that AI will work in their favor. Consumers may not have much control, but they do hold the dollars companies need to thrive, and they can withhold them from companies that treat them poorly. “I think it’s possible that this is headed back to cost-based pricing,” said Owens, whose book Gouged about the new era of pricing releases next year. “It’s the way companies priced for decades … There is a world where the outcome is transparent, public, predictable pricing.” First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.
