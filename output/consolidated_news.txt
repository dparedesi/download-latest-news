Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says that the ride-sharing and delivery company is eyeing stablecoins as a tool for business. In an interview during the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco, Khosrowshahi says that Uber is looking at the use cases for stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to other assets such as the US dollar. “We’re still in the study phase, but I think stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value. Obviously, you can have your opinions on Bitcoin, but it’s a proven commodity, and people have different opinions on where it’s going.” One stablecoin use case that Khosrowshahi believes could benefit Uber and other companies is its potential to reduce the costs associated with transferring money internationally. “I do think that stablecoin is quite promising, especially for global companies that are moving money around globally to create a mechanism for us to essentially reduce costs in terms of moving money internationally. So that’s super interesting to us. And we’re definitely going to take a look.” Khosrowshani’s statements come following stablecoin giant Circle’s debut as a public company on Thursday. The USDC and Euro Coin (EURC) issuer is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol CRCL.

In a recent interview with Decrypt, Kerbrat said that blockchains could one day be used to help startup founders raise capital in a transparent way that helps them preserve control. However, under current rules in the U.S., 90% of the population wouldn’t be able to participate—because they don’t, for example, make more than $200,000 a year. Typically, as a company goes from a passion project to publicly traded firm, venture capitalists and private equity firms help raise funds along the way. When it comes to listing on a stock exchange, investment banks also play a significant role, underwriting the offering, and as Kerbrat described it, commanding a “huge banking fee.” According to Kerbrat, a founder risks losing control through share dilution, among other factors, as intermediaries extend their services on the company’s path to an eventual IPO. On top of that, venues like the Nasdaq often charge their own exchange fee, he added. “These steps are just middlemen that are taking over the company, and not necessarily creating value for your customer, for your employee base, or anything like that,” he said. “We could bring, with tokenization, a new world to raising funds, where instead of launching a new coin, you could launch a new offering for your startup and raise funds on-chain.” With a regulatory backdrop that’s more supportive of innovation, Kerbrat said that Robinhood is well positioned to help startup founders bypass middlemen, leveraging its “huge retail platform” alongside its connections on the institutional side with market makers. Instead of basing an investor’s accreditation on factors like their salary, Kerbrat argued that “the checkpoint should be education” and whether investors are aware that early-stage investments carry outsized risk. In April, Kerbrat submitted a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission recommending that there should be knowledge-based tests and self-certification components to accreditation. “A new regulatory approach is needed to allow tokenization to flourish, and that system should be designed at a federal level to provide consistency to the marketplace,” the letter stated. Whether it’s stocks, bonds, or real estate, tokenization can refer to any asset that's represented with a token on-chain. Last month, crypto exchange Kraken said that it would begin offering users in Europe the ability to trade U.S.-listed stocks using Solana. Tokenization advocates, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, have focused on benefits beyond the potential democratization of markets. When he backed tokenization in 2022, his focus was on greater market efficiency and settlement that’s nearly instantaneous. “I think there are a lot of advantages, but right now, what is blocking us from this world is a lot of [outdated] rules,” Kerbrat said, underscoring that tech isn’t what’s holding tokenization back.

Title: FIR against HDFC Bank MD-CEO by loan defaulter

TikTok’s parent company, has been replacing US-hired staff near Seattle with managers connected to China, aiming to replicate its e-commerce success in Asia after sales fell short in America. TikTok Shop initially set a goal to increase its US e-commerce business tenfold last year to $17.5 billion in transaction volume, but had to drastically lower that objective, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly. TikTok established its Shop business in the Seattle area near Amazon.com Inc., the online retail giant it was aiming to displace. Meetings that used to be held in English are now often conducted in Mandarin and managers increasingly write in Chinese when communicating on Feishu, ByteDance’s internal Slack-like app, with English-speaking staff forced to rely on the built-in translation function. “We continually assess our business needs and have made recent team adjustments to strengthen our organization, remaining confident in the future ahead,” a TikTok Shop spokesperson said. The company previously called the reported e-commerce transaction target “inaccurate.” More than 100 TikTok Shop employees in the US have been fired or have left amid confusion between leaders that has worsened the work environment, according to people familiar with the company. The cultural transition taking place in the firm coincides with its fight for survival in the US — due mainly to the app’s Chinese ties. A national security law passed by Congress last year requires TikTok’s US business to be spun off from its Chinese parent company or it will face a ban. Lawmakers warned that TikTok’s ties to China pose a threat to the safety and security of American users. President Donald Trump has twice delayed the ban — with legal assurances from his attorney general — and another deadline for divestiture looms later this month, though that might also be extended, the Wall Street Journal reported. ByteDance said during the Biden administration that it had no plan to sell TikTok, but in April the Beijing-based company confirmed that it had been in discussions with the Trump government regarding a potential solution for TikTok US. It said any agreement would be subject to approval under Chinese law. The TikTok Shop near Seattle in February began requiring workers to be in the office five days a week for eight hours a day, according to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg. The change is in contrast to some other major tech companies that still offer flexible work schedules, and has been particularly burdensome for employees who often join late-night calls with colleagues in Asia after they leave the office, according to former employees. US-based staff require human resources and manager pre-approval to work from home. The changes were introduced after Bob Kang, China-based global head of TikTok’s e-commerce division, visited the office in Bellevue, Washington, earlier this year and found there weren’t enough staff present on a work day, according to multiple people who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Assigning Chinese executives to run TikTok’s fastest-growing business may raise questions about its previous corporate promise to distance the US operation from China. After Trump initially tried to ban the app during his first term, the company announced a security plan dubbed “Project Texas” and vowed to wall off the app’s US data and operations from any Chinese oversight. TikTok Shop is the biggest source of revenue for the video-sharing app besides advertising, and it has become a major investment area for ByteDance. Adding full-scale commerce to its eye-catching content and popular influencers sets it apart from rivals like Instagram and YouTube. The company still aims to challenge Amazon in major markets. Recruited Aggressively To better compete, TikTok Shop recruited aggressively near Seattle over the past three years, targeting people with experience at Amazon, according to a review of Linkedin profiles and people who worked at both companies. In some corners of TikTok’s Bellevue office of about 1,000 employees, the workflow felt like a remix of previous Amazon teams, the people said. But since January, growing tension in the teams below Kang and Nico Le Bourgeois, who oversaw TikTok’s e-commerce operations in the US, became a distraction for staff who were often unsure about whose orders to follow, the people said. TikTok’s uncertain fate in the US also weighed on morale. The company carried out a round of layoffs in April. A second batch followed in May. In the first round, Le Bourgeois was demoted when Mu Qing, a Chinese executive from ByteDance’s e-commerce platform Douyin moved to the Seattle area to run TikTok Shop in the US. After the second bout, Mu sent an internal message saying Le Bourgeois was leaving to pursue other opportunities, according to a copy of the message seen by Bloomberg. Those cuts were intended to improve TikTok’s “efficiency,” according to former employees, though it wasn’t clear to staff what factors contributed to a worker’s efficiency rating. With these changes, ByteDance leaders are bringing in people who are familiar with what worked for the company in China, where Douyin, its TikTok clone for the Chinese market, has evolved into a $490 billion shopping phenomenon. In addition to Mu, who was the head of Douyin’s e-commerce, six other leaders with Chinese backgrounds were appointed in April, according to a different internal memo from Kang viewed by Bloomberg. Possible Ban One challenge is that habits of many American users trend toward passive TikTok scrolling as opposed to making purchases in the app. Some US sellers told Bloomberg that they have also been reluctant to invest in the platform, given the possible ban. The final tally for the US e-commerce business’s 2024 sales came in at around $9 billion, according to an estimate by Singapore-based consultancy Momentum Works. TikTok Shop’s US struggles haven’t halted the company’s global shopping ambitions. ByteDance in 2021 rolled out e-commerce services in countries including Indonesia, Vietnam and the UK. In Southeast Asia, it’s already the region’s biggest shopping platform after Shopee, according to Momentum Works. Last year, TikTok Shop opened in five countries in Europe, including Germany and Spain. The Europe expansion was delayed because the company first prioritized US growth, Bloomberg reported. This is a crucial month for TikTok in the US. The company will host merchants and creators in Los Angeles next week for a summit featuring some of the new leaders of the e-commerce unit. The current deadline for ByteDance to sell the TikTok’s US operation is June 19 and there have been several interested suitors. The company came close to a possible spin-off in April to a consortium of investors that included Oracle Corp., but the deal was scuttled in part because of Trump’s trade war with China. Meanwhile, the churn of e-commerce employment continues in the Seattle area. Current and former TikTok Shop employees told Bloomberg that they get hounded by recruiting messages from Temu, another Chinese e-commerce competitor.

Title: Recession Risk After The Jobs Report
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/06/08/recession-risk-after-the-jobs-report/
Time Published: 2025-06-08T13:19:46Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Stocks and the 10-year US Treasury yield rose after the solid monthly payrolls report on Friday. ... More Market performance has been closely tied to economic data since the early April stock lows. Stocks have marched higher since their early April low as the fear of an impending recession has receded. The S&P 500 is 2.3% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 8.9% below its mid-December level. With many crosscurrents remaining, it seems appropriate to revisit the status of some timely recession indicators. Market Performance Accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging. However, in an environment with tariff threats, monitoring specific high-frequency data can provide an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available on a monthly basis, sometimes with a significant time lag. Despite the economic data remaining resilient, consensus estimates of 2025 US GDP growth remain well below the levels seen earlier in the year. Economists generally expect the drag from tariffs to slow economic growth in the second half of the year. Consensus US GDP Growth Forecasts Baa corporate bond data has a long history and provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield that investors demand beyond US Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk associated with buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. Spreads on Baa corporate debt are below the highs hit as stocks bottomed in early April. The narrowing of spreads is consistent with a lower risk of economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) on a weekly basis. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart indicates that periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have frequently been correlated with recessions. Similar to credit spreads, the tightness of financial conditions has eased from the early-April highs. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been outperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. The improved performance of cyclical stocks suggests that the economic growth scare is waning. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is arguably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the US 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also known as yield curve inversion, a recession is likely to follow. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which did not produce subsequent economic recessions. The US economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has widely variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better predictive track record than economists and is used in nearly every Federal Reserve model; therefore, it is worth watching despite its flaws. The curve is not currently inverted and has generally been steepening instead. Yield Curve The labor market is the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. Initial claims are ticking higher, but the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or one consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. The uptrend suggests that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new ones. Recall that the number of employees in the US has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The labor market is softening, but it has not yet reached the tipping point. Continuing Claims The closely watched monthly jobs report was released on Friday. Payroll job growth was slightly better than expected at 139,000, but the previous two months were revised lower. The household survey reported job losses of 696,000, but the labor force contracted by a similar amount, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2%. Monthly Job Growth Examining the employment of prime working-age people, aged 25 to 54, can provide a good indicator of the labor market’s condition. In addition to being a crucial group, the measure also avoids some of the demographic distortions associated with other methods. Prime-age employment to population ratio fell month-over-month, but using the three-month average to remove volatility, it held steady. The trend appears to be flat to lower, which adds some concern to the outlook. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Overall, job growth is adequate, with the labor market bending lower but not yet breaking. Markets reacted favorably to the monthly jobs report on Friday, indicating less worry about the economic outlook, with US Treasury yields and stocks moving higher. Lastly, the betting market has seen a steep drop in the odds of a recession in 2025. Betting odds move much more quickly than consensus estimates and should be considered more accurate since real dollars are at stake regarding the outcome. 2025 US Recession Betting Odds Wednesday’s May consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be closely watched as some tariff-related price increases are expected to be reflected. On the other hand, some other price decreases should keep the headline inflation growth in check. Consensus expects a 2.5% year-over-year rate, up from 2.3% last month. The Cleveland Fed’s estimate for May CPI is a bit lower at 2.4%. US CPI Inflation Estimate The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading on Friday will be notable. Consumer sentiment plummeted with the announcement of the wide-ranging tariffs on Liberation Day. While economic activity has not followed suit, the sharp plunge in sentiment has raised concerns about an eventual downturn. A rebound in sentiment would be welcome and could help alleviate those concerns. Stocks have rebounded as the odds of a recession have fallen. There is still room for the odds to fall further, but the risk remains that they could rise again in the event of a reignition of a hotter trade war. Additionally, the pull forward in activity from and the weights of the tariffs will likely be seen in slower economic growth in the second half of the year. Stocks & Recession Odds While much of the existing US tariffs could be struck down by the courts, President Trump has other methods to implement tariffs, even if they take more time and effort.

These indicators are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available on a monthly basis, sometimes with a significant time lag. Despite the economic data remaining resilient, consensus estimates of 2025 US GDP growth remain well below the levels seen earlier in the year. Economists generally expect the drag from tariffs to slow economic growth in the second half of the year. Consensus US GDP Growth Forecasts Baa corporate bond data has a long history and provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield that investors demand beyond US Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk associated with buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. Spreads on Baa corporate debt are below the highs hit as stocks bottomed in early April. The narrowing of spreads is consistent with a lower risk of economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) on a weekly basis. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart indicates that periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have frequently been correlated with recessions. Similar to credit spreads, the tightness of financial conditions has eased from the early-April highs. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been outperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. The improved performance of cyclical stocks suggests that the economic growth scare is waning. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is arguably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the US 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also known as yield curve inversion, a recession is likely to follow. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which did not produce subsequent economic recessions. The US economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has widely variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better predictive track record than economists and is used in nearly every Federal Reserve model; therefore, it is worth watching despite its flaws. The curve is not currently inverted and has generally been steepening instead. Yield Curve The labor market is the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. Initial claims are ticking higher, but the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or one consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. The uptrend suggests that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new ones. Recall that the number of employees in the US has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The labor market is softening, but it has not yet reached the tipping point. Continuing Claims The closely watched monthly jobs report was released on Friday. Payroll job growth was slightly better than expected at 139,000, but the previous two months were revised lower. The household survey reported job losses of 696,000, but the labor force contracted by a similar amount, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2%. Monthly Job Growth Examining the employment of prime working-age people, aged 25 to 54, can provide a good indicator of the labor market’s condition. In addition to being a crucial group, the measure also avoids some of the demographic distortions associated with other methods. Prime-age employment to population ratio fell month-over-month, but using the three-month average to remove volatility, it held steady. The trend appears to be flat to lower, which adds some concern to the outlook. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Overall, job growth is adequate, with the labor market bending lower but not yet breaking. Markets reacted favorably to the monthly jobs report on Friday, indicating less worry about the economic outlook, with US Treasury yields and stocks moving higher. Lastly, the betting market has seen a steep drop in the odds of a recession in 2025. Betting odds move much more quickly than consensus estimates and should be considered more accurate since real dollars are at stake regarding the outcome. 2025 US Recession Betting Odds Wednesday’s May consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be closely watched as some tariff-related price increases are expected to be reflected. On the other hand, some other price decreases should keep the headline inflation growth in check. Consensus expects a 2.5% year-over-year rate, up from 2.3% last month. The Cleveland Fed’s estimate for May CPI is a bit lower at 2.4%. US CPI Inflation Estimate The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading on Friday will be notable. Consumer sentiment plummeted with the announcement of the wide-ranging tariffs on Liberation Day. While economic activity has not followed suit, the sharp plunge in sentiment has raised concerns about an eventual downturn. A rebound in sentiment would be welcome and could help alleviate those concerns. Stocks have rebounded as the odds of a recession have fallen. There is still room for the odds to fall further, but the risk remains that they could rise again in the event of a reignition of a hotter trade war. Additionally, the pull forward in activity from and the weights of the tariffs will likely be seen in slower economic growth in the second half of the year.

Title: Data centers are building their own gas power plants in Texas

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it. The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road. “It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.” The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this build out promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.” Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar, and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability. “There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.” IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers—giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totaling 411,600 MW of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, S.B. 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies. Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply. Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today. Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation. Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try to slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand. This build-out promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records. Texas, with 9 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15 percent of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26 percent of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state. GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers. For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand. “The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.” It forecast up to a 20 percent increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers. Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals, and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate. It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines have quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook. “If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said. The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March. About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference. “Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.” Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 MW of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity. Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 MW cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940. “Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.” CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 MW gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 MW data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart. Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 MW South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 MW megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar, and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 MW from the grid. Altogether, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global. “There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.” However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals. Looking forward to a build out of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer. Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power. “It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.” While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry. One failed bill, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, H.B. 3356 and S.B. 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating. When the legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund. Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, S.B. 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas, or nuclear — needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass. Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state. Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue. More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40 percent of their income. He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the legislature is headed with renewables. “I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

June 08, 2025 08:18 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Apple, Oracle, Adobe and inflation: Stocks and economic data to watch this week

Last week, markets closed in the green, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all notching gains amid a bumper crop of political drama. The most explosive news came from the sudden and very public rupture between President Trump and Elon Musk, a feud that helped trigger Tesla’s (TSLA) worst stock plunge in over a year. On the macro side, Friday’s jobs report showed a still-solid labor market, reinforcing expectations that rate cuts will remain on hold. In contrast, however, forward-looking layoff data from Challenger Gray pointed to a chill spreading through white-collar ranks that’s worth watching. The week ahead promises plenty of fresh catalysts. Apple’s (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off , with investors watching closely for AI announcements that could reenergize the company’s growth. Midweek brings the latest Consumer Price Index report, a key gauge of inflation. And while earnings season is winding down, reports from Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) will offer insight as to whether corporate belt-tightening is easing or just beginning. Expect loads of coverage as Apple kicks off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), with the keynote address scheduled for 1:00 p.m. ET. The tech giant is expected to unveil updates to its various OS offerings, perhaps alongside some news of much-hoped-for AI expansion. With Apple shares deeply lagging the broader market this year (down 17% vs. the Nasdaq’s 1.5% gain), WWDC could be a turning point for sentiment. Also on the calendar: earnings from Casey’s General Stores (CASY), the gas station and convenience chain with a strong rural footprint. The company reports before the market opens, with Wall Street expecting increased sales and decreased profits. GameStop (GME) reports after the bell. While the company’s core business has continued to struggle, investors will be watching closely for updates on GameStop’s recent $500 million Bitcoin investment and what it signals about the retailer’s evolving identity. Also reporting after hours: Dave & Buster’s (PLAY), with analysts look looking for clues about the state of consumer discretionary spending, especially among younger adults and families. On the economic front, the National Federation of Independent Business will release its May Small Business Optimism Index before the market open, giving Wall Street a read on Main Street’s hiring plans and confidence levels. Oracle will report earnings after the market closes, providing investors with an important read on enterprise tech demand and AI-related spending. But the main event is inflation. At 8:30 a.m. ET, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the May Consumer Price Index (CPI). Analysts and investors will be parsing the data for any signs that tariffs and stickier components such as shelter are driving prices higher. With the Fed meeting just a week away, it’s likely this CPI print could prove pivotal. Adobe will release earnings after the market close, with analysts expecting revenue around $5.8 billion, reflecting continued growth in Adobe’s digital media and enterprise AI products. On the economic front, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the May Producer Price Index (PPI) at 8:30 a.m. ET, providing a look at inflation at the wholesale level. Weekly initial jobless claims for the week ending June 7 will be reported at the same time. The previous week saw 247,000 new claims, a worrying sign. No major earnings reports are scheduled, but markets will be tuned in at 10:00 a.m. ET for the preliminary June reading of the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index. While typically considered a second-tier indicator, Michigan sentiment can behave like canary in the coal mine during economic downturns, so this one could carry extra weight. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: What To Expect in Markets This Week: May Inflation Data, Apple Conference, GameStop Earnings

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets. Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week. A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday. After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Wednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17. Trump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom. GameStop’s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which fired up the meme stock craze in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies centering their business models on buying bitcoin. AI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle’s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SoftBank as part of a joint venture known as Stargate to build AI infrastructure. Adobe’s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the company’s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.

Title: Have Reporting Burdens Led To More Firms Staying Private?

ByShivaram Rajgopal ByShivaram Rajgopal, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 10: The Uber banner hangs outside of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ... More before the Opening Bell at the NYSE as the ride-hailing company Uber makes its highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) on May 10, 2019 in New York City. Uber will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange after raising $8.1 billion in the biggest U.S. IPO in five years.Thousands of Uber and other app based drivers protested around the country on Wednesday to demand better pay and working conditions including sick leave, over time and a minimum wage. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) The best evidence for this hypothesis comes from micro-caps. Confounding trends and offsetting benefits of being public are often ignored by advocates for reducing reporting rules. The number of US public firms has fallen in recent times. Prof. Jay Ritter, who tracks these numbers, documents that we had 3,804 US listed firms at the end of 2024 relative to the peak of around 8000 in 1996. Remarkably we had 1,384 foreign firms listed at the end of 2024. Many blame higher costs reporting and auditing for the smaller number of US listed firms. They point to the cumulative onslaught of Sarbanes Oxley 2022, the 2003 Global Settlement that alleged made it harder for analysts to cover small firms, Dodd-Frank 2010, and the supposedly relentless pace of accounting and auditing regulation pushed by Congress, the SEC and the FASB. The question I want to address is whether there is any evidence for that claim. Trend depends on benchmark period In a research note, Vanguard points out that if we go back to 1972, the decline shrinks to a third. On top of that, 1972 was the year NASDAQ was set up and 3,000 odd new companies entered the public arena. Why the fall? Doidge, Karolyi, Shen and Stulz (2025) list two potential underlying reasons: (i) it is easier to stay private because restrictions on staying private have softened and it has become easier to raise funds for private firms, perhaps due to the low interest rate environment; and (ii) antitrust enforcement over the last decade has been relatively lax and product market competition has heated up leading to a greater number of mergers. They don’t seem to devote much space to reporting cost burden. Acquisitions drive most of the decline A McKinsey piece shows that 95% of the exits from our markets are driven by acquisitions. Thus, the so-called missing companies have not left the investible universe for the US investor as the investor gets indirect exposure to the target via the acquirer’s stock. Espen Eckbo makes the acquisition point more rigorously. However, the rate of entry and exit into public markets is not uniform across industries. We had more IPOs, relative to exits, in pharmaceutical and biotech industries. The number of IPOs, relative to exits, are more or less the same in retail, materials, consumer apparel and durables. Exits far exceed IPOs in banking, software, technology hardware, media and telecom. Any theory that argues reporting burdens are a first order problem needs to explain why such burden has massively increased for banking, software, tech hardware, media and telecom relative to pharma. Smaller IPOs, mostly micro-caps, gone The McKinsey piece also makes the interesting point that we have far fewer smaller IPOs now relative to the past. This suggests that more of the earlier value is captured by private investors, as private equity firms seem to take longer to exit their positions now relative to before (3 years in 2007 relative to 6 years in 2015). One could argue that the costs of reporting, auditing and compliance have become too large for smaller IPOs to even think about going public. Vanguard points out that the missing IPOs are micro-caps. Is the loss of micro-caps a policy concern? Moreover, Mauboussin, Callahan, and Majd (2017) and Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2017) note that half of what can be referred to as the “listing gap” (exits more than IPOs) occurred before Sarbanes Oxley became law. Start-ups have declined too Somewhat intriguing, the number of start-ups appears to display mixed patterns since 1996. The Kaufmann index of startup activity falls from 1996 to its nadir in 2013, after which it picks up till 2017, when the index was last published but the 2017 number was still lower than the 1996 number. This suggests that there may be fewer businesses even available to go public. International exchanges I am in the UK as I write this and an institutional investor I know here suggested that the London stock exchange has suffered a similar decline in IPOs. In fact, there is some angst in the UK that they are losing listings to the US. The loss in listings applies to other advanced economies as well, as Espen Eckbo points out. The theory pushing for reporting burdens as the primary explanation will have to explain why UK reporting and reporting in other advanced economies has also become onerously burdensome. Burgeoning private equity (PE) A senior executive tells me,” the payouts achieved by management and their VCs by arranging acquisitions to PE firms, as well as PE to PE sales have been, in recent times, just as compelling as anything other than a truly dramatic IPO. Smaller companies, companies with significant internal ownership, companies without strong growth or high investment opportunities (that is to say not pharma or biotech who absolutely need risk capital), companies where management would like to stay involved but are not keen on public company visibility. These are all great reasons to be acquired by PE rather than either IPO or even getting acquired by a public company rapidly, with certainty, without much publicity. PE is incredibly well equipped at maximizing ongoing cashflows, and growth, while still maintaining: (i) particularly attractive incentives for management in the transaction, (ii) management that stays post transaction with significant incentive retentions and milestones -- all without pesky proxy announcements about executive compensation; and (iii) objectively great returns to those equity holders that are just selling.” The role of reporting for intangibles Rene Stulz (2018) has suggested that new firms heavily invest in intangibles and forced disclosure of intangibles by securities laws, all else constant, encourage firms to stay private. I am not sure of this argument as US public firms barely tell us anything about their intangible investments, especially home grown ones. Papers suggesting that SOX increased regulatory burdens Zhang (2007) finds negative returns of around -15% to -13% around the events surrounding the passage of SOX. I find these returns too large to be credible. Engel, Hayes, and Wang (2007) observed an increase in decisions to go private after SOX. But this evidence is mixed. Bartlett (2008) of the Stanford Law School re-examines this question and concludes, “non-SOX factors were the primary impetus for the "name brand" buyouts commonly evoked as evidence that SOX has harmed the competitiveness of U.S. capital markets.” Iliev (2010) is perhaps the best cited paper in the area. Using careful research designs, Iliev documents that section 404 of the SOX, which mandates that the auditor attest the internal controls of the firm for the absence of a material weakness, led to conservative reported earnings but also imposed real costs. Iliev compares audit fees and earnings quality for firms with float of $50-75 million to those just above at $75 million-$100 million. The idea is that firms in these two partitions are mostly similar except that Section 404 applies only to firms with float greater than $75 million. He concludes, “on net, SOX compliance reduced the market value of small firms” and increases audit fees by 167%. Atanasov and Black (2020) replicate Iliev (2010) and conclude that not controlling for firm growth led Iliev (2010) to overestimate SOX compliance costs in his analysis. However, the increase in audit fees suffered by the small firms is real, by about 80%. The dollar numbers underlying these estimates are worth reiterating. The average firm in Iliev’s affected firm sample pays more than $0.7 million in greater audit fees. The mean and median earnings of sample firms is -$4.8 million and -$1.4 million respectively. Iliev uses this comparison to argue that the compliance costs of section 404 were substantial. Were they? Would these firms have survived had section 404 not been enacted? Is it obvious that investors would have wanted to invest in such firms? And, how much of the audit fee hike is temporary for a year or two. Even more noteworthy, this evidence relates to micro caps (defined as stocks with market capitalizations of between $50 million and $250 million in 2024). These numbers would be smaller if we went back in time as stock markets have gone up quite a bit in the last 20 years or so. The bigger question is how can we possibly generalize evidence reliant on a sample of microcaps to the entire corporate ecosystem? Ewens, Xiao and Xu (2024), in a new paper, move this literature forward and consider three such natural breakpoints to estimate costs of mandatory reporting: (i) firms below $25 million in float in 1992 were designated as “small businesses” and escaped a few disclosure requirements; (ii) the $75 million float threshold that Iliev looked for section 404 of SOX; and (iii) the $700 million float threshold used in the 2012 JOBS Act. The 2012 JOBS Act is interesting because the point of that legislation was to exempt smaller firms from a few reporting requirements. So, the JOBS Act presents a bit of a counterfactual to the usual setting whereby regulation increased. Based on these events, they claim that the median firm spends 4.3% of its market capitalization on compliance costs. I find the 4.3% number somewhat big. Moreover, even with the clever econometrics used in the paper, can one really generalize estimates from SOX and JOBS Act to the universe of firms? I don’t know. Interestingly, Ewens et al. themselves seem to conclude, “heightened regulatory costs only explain a small fraction of the decline in the number of public firms over the last two decades. Our results suggest that non-regulatory factors likely played a more important role in explaining the decline in the number of U.S. public firms.” Evidence around the 2012 JOBS Act Researchers are generally good at coming up with unintended consequences of regulations that public firms are required to follow. But we don’t often see studies that document the offsetting benefits of going or staying public. The 2012 JOBS Act presents a rare opportunity to consider whether relaxing reporting regulations encourages more IPOs. Dambra et al. (2015) conclude that the 2012 JOBS Act led to an increase of 21 IPOs a year, on average. Ewens et al. (2024) find a slightly higher estimate: roughly 28 additional IPOs. One must wonder whether 20 odd IPOs per year are worth the potential collateral damage to the credibility of US reporting and compliance systems, if the PCAOB were to be dismantled or SOX were to be repealed. Incidentally, many other advanced economies passed regulation, modeled on SOX, in their own countries. Did they not conduct a careful assessment of costs of such regulation on their IPO activity? Or did they recognize the need to tighten up reporting and audit rules after the tech bubble burst in 2001? IPO Tax Robert Jackson's, the ex-SEC commissioner, analysis highlights the 7% tax that middle market IPOs must pay even before they go public, to investment bankers, lawyers and the like. Surely, the IPO tax, which has little to do per se with the reporting and compliance costs of 4.3% highlighted by Ewens et al, deserves more attention. The advocates of cutting reporting burdens are somewhat silent about reducing the 7% middle market IPO tax. And I am aware of startups that are working on software that can write an S1 in minutes with AI. Shouldn’t the 4.3% reporting costs, estimated by Ewens et al., fall? Benefits of staying public are often ignored Owners, VCs, and capital providers get liquidity. Public firms can potentially pay labor mostly via stock and hence attract higher quality talent. Stock can be used as a means of payment to buy another company and hence take out a rival or to buy a complementary firm. If you get acquired, the acquirer is usually expected to pay a 25% control premium over the prevailing stock price. In sum, the case for reporting burdens forcing companies to stay private is far from clear. The best evidence relates to micro-caps and generalizing from that set to other companies is not straightforward. Partisan debate about the evidence often tends to ignore the vast number of confounding factors such as low interest rates, falling number of start-ups, special time periods chosen for the analysis and large number of acquisitions of public firms and the 7% IPO tax. If anything, US reporting rules need to be strengthened, not weakened. I have pointed out, time and again, the deficiencies in our financial reporting system and how auditors could potentially do a better job. Regulators may want to proceed with caution the next time someone brings up the hypothesis that reporting burdens are a significant barrier to US firms going public.

Title: Billionaire BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Warns $36,000,000,000,000 Debt Will ‘Overwhelm’ America Unless Stellar Economic Growth Achieved

The chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager just issued a dire warning, saying that the US will drown in debt unless the country finds a way to stimulate and grow the economy. Speaking at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Larry Fink details the remarkable pace at which the US has amassed an astronomical amount of debt. “After 223 years of being a nation in 2000, the [national debt] of the United States was $8 trillion. And in the last 25 years, both parties are guilty of this, [that number’s] now at $36 trillion. And now we have a pending tax bill that’s going to add $2.3 to $2.4 trillion on the back of that. If we don’t find a way to grow at 3% a year, real growth, we’re going to hit the wall.” Although the numbers are bleak, Fink believes the US can still climb out of its multi-trillion-dollar hole, outlining a number of steps that policymakers can take to spur real economic growth across multiple industries. “This is why we need to unlock more private capital… We need to be streamlining permitting, we need to be focused on rebuilding our infrastructure. If you believe that we’re going to be the leader in AI (artificial intelligence), we’re going to have, it’s estimated, a shortage of 500,000 electricians in this country. So, despite all of this pessimism, the foundation of growth is there. We just need to unlock it… If we cannot unlock that growth and if we’re going to continue to stumble along in a 2% economy, the [national debt is] going to overwhelm this country.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Henry Holterman: Dutch Midas found a 1 billion euro gold opportunity in Greece
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/06/08/henry-holterman-dutch-midas-found-a-1-billion-euro-gold-opportunity-in-greece/

Full Content:
Henry Holterman is a numbers man. In this invisible but fundamental universe there is no room for misinterpretation or sentimentality. So, by the numbers, the Dutch investor is among the most successful dealmakers of the last few decades in Greece. From the recent deal to sell his 9.75% stake in Alpha Bank, profitable transactions in GEK TERNA, Hellaktor and the capital gains from his holdings in Greece, both visible and hidden, are estimated to have so far earned a sum approaching €1 billion. They have been reported to have accumulated over the past few years, and in the meantime, the company has been able to report a total of more than 1 billion euros in assets to date. An impressive performance, but fully justified. Those who have met him speak of an absolutely disciplined investor, with a clear focus and a special ability to identify undervalued assets, making positions without loans and margins. In all cases of his investment moves in our country, those who have interacted with him say that he is a result-oriented person, who is not influenced by his thymic or ego, even in the tough races that have arisen. Just business, aiming for maximum profit. If others win along with it that’s fine, but it’s not an end in itself. The obstacles that appear in his path are an opportunity to rethink strategy and seek alternative moves to ensure a successful exit. No matter how long it takes. His moves reflect what he stands for in terms of investment. In early 2018 and in the midst of the shareholder civil war at Hellaktor, Holterman travelled by private plane to Athens at the invitation of the Kallitsantsis brothers who were seeking support for the proxy war that would shake the historic group, with the aim of overthrowing the then management of the construction group. The talks did not end positively, as did another venture, that of acquiring then Forthnet in partnership with the Odyssey-Athena group, but another opportunity had already arisen that brought him first a 10% and then a 30% stake in GEK Terna. He left the group of Mr George Peristeri after a long time but for an estimated €200 million. Having new firepower, he was placed in the Hellactor group and after more than two years of fierce competition, first with the Kallitsantsis side and later with the triumvirate of Kaymenakis – Bakos – Exarchos, he finally prevailed, having also secured a strong alliance with the Vardinoyannis group. This was followed by the asset sale of the once-mighty Hellactor group, which was done with mathematical sequence precision, and in 2021, when investment grade was still a distant goal for Greece, he invested in Alpha Bank. And while tons of ink had been spilled about how the Dutchman would become… a banker and increase his stake in the bank even further, he correctly interpreted the signs and decided to sell his stake, reaping a profit of more than €340 million. At the same time, he retains a 3.95% stake in Optima Bank, which he acquired in the IPO for €21 million, a stake currently valued at approximately €60 million. Holterman could be said to be the epitome of the “Dutch dream”, an expression that is, of course, incongruous because, given the journalistic cliché, such stories happen all the time in America. And yet, its trajectory to date has the characteristics of a story that would easily transfer to cinema. Born in 1955, after his studies, he began working as a chartered accountant. Legend has it that he was assigned to audit VolkerWessels, one of the largest and oldest Dutch groups active in construction and infrastructure, with Reggeborgh as its investment arm. At that time he meets and marries Herita, one of the two daughters of owner Dick Wessels. And Vessels, after all, started from the bottom. He worked in the carpentry business founded by his father, Arendt, in 1933. In 1968, at the age of 22, he took over management of the company and grew it rapidly, becoming one of the largest construction groups in Europe. In 2017, when Wessels passed away, he held third place on the list of the richest Dutchmen, with an estimated fortune of around €4 billion. Holterman took over the reins of the Vessels family business empire in 2017 after the death of his father-in-law. Reggeborgh, founded in 1990 to manage investments for the Dutch Vessel family, has now developed a portfolio of more than 20 companies in a variety of sectors, ranging from infrastructure and real estate to energy, medical research, and new technologies. The company operates in Europe and the Americas, and its portfolio includes companies such as Koninklijke VolkerWessels, DW Property, Prescan, Tesorio, and EVI. In total, the family’s assets are estimated at €15-20 billion. The Dutch investment fund also has significant investment positions, led by a 3.04% stake in ABN Amro Bank. Reggeborgh became the fifth largest shareholder in ABN Amro behind the Dutch state, US-based MFS Investment Management, Norwegian NBIM, and BlackRock. The fund had earlier sold ING its 17.6% stake in Dutch private asset manager Van Lanschot Kempen. Those who know Holterman associate his name with the description “gambler”. In Greek, the designation leaves room for many interpretations, but in the case of the Dutchman it can be said literally, as it captures his appeal for financial investments. However, one of these was destined to cause Holterman problems, which he successfully overcame and reaped significant gains, which would continue to happen in the future. Reggeborgh was among the original investors in the technology company World Online, retaining a significant stake at the time of its listing in 2000. After the IPO, however, its shares suffered a significant drop, causing losses for many investors, but not for Reggeborgh, as it was revealed that it had sold before the collapse. Holterman’s involvement with World Online also had legal ramifications, as the company’s founder, Nina Brink (aka Nina Storms) claimed €182 million from Reggeborgh, claiming it was owed to her under an agreement. The dispute lasted nearly two decades and was eventually settled out of court, with the Dutchman having said there was no wrongdoing in the company’s listing and that the responsibility for the losses lay with investors’ exaggerated expectations. Under Holterman, the family office made other profitable moves, despite being under the microscope of the supervisory authorities, and in addition to World Online, the family office made significant gains from the fibre-optic companies Reggefiber and Eurofiber, as well as the investment bank NIBC. At the same time, Greece enters his life, and surely even he would not have expected that in our country, he would discover a gold mine of goodwill that added about 1 billion euros to his fortune. About 25 years ago, together with his wife, Herita, they decided to buy a holiday home in Corfu. They acquired a magnificent property in Kassiopi, an area of unique natural beauty in the north of the island where, among others, are the holiday homes of the Rothschild family, German investor Yergk Rockenhizer (Permira), Rob Lucas (CVC Capital), and other super-rich. That’s when he met Mr. Nikos Dendia, one of the island’s best-known lawyers at the time, and long before the Corfiot lawyer, originally from Paxos, entered politics and was elected as a member of parliament. The Dendia law firm handled most of the cases of the Dutch businessman, who proved to be extremely active in investing in the country. Holterman’s ties with the Faiacs Island would prove strong in the process. He would buy a dream villa in the Kommeno area, and almost every summer, he would enjoy the beauty and refined gastronomy of Corfu. From there, he gazes at the green and blue of the bay of Gouvia, which is often crossed by the “Guilty”, the famous boat of the Ioannou family, who also maintain a holiday home in the same area. Of course, Holterman knows his way around a yacht himself, having years ago acquired the 47-metre yacht “Lars” built at the well-known Italian shipyard Sanlorenzo. However, a few years ago, he put it up for sale for 24 million euros, and it eventually changed hands for an undisclosed price. Unlike the sea, land seems to be the great love of the now 70-year-old businessman. The properties he has acquired in Corfu, as well as in Athens, are just as unique as the equity investments he has made in the country. One could say that the real estate purchases he has made reflect his investment philosophy. These were properties with excellent location and characteristics, just waiting for someone to bring out their value. A typical example is the historic “Corfu Palace” hotel, which he bought, it was reported, for €30 million from the Fokas family. The hotel started operating in 1962 and is literally in a prime location in the island town, but it has gone from periods of glory to periods of decline, as it required heavy maintenance and renovation, which was done intermittently and never completely. The “Corfu Palace” in the hands of the Dutchman is now being completely renovated, in an investment of 20 million euros, and when it reopens in 2026, it will claim a good slice of the luxury hoteling pie on the cosmopolitan island. Two years ago, it also acquired just two blocks from the “Corfu Palace,” another neoclassical building overlooking Garitsa Bay, totalling 1,000 square metres, at a price of more than 2 million euros. Five years ago, he appeared to have acquired in Corfu and the famous Red House or Antico Rosso, for 8 million euros. It is a property of stunning beauty with a 17th-century mansion built on the ruins of a 13th-century monastery. It belonged to the Kourkoumeli-Rodostamos family, one of the oldest on the island, united by the marriage of Nikolaos Rodostamos and Maria, sister of Ioannis Kapodistrias. Those who know him say that from the first moment, he loved Corfu, and he constantly makes sure to prove it. He has made donations to the island’s hospital, the Coast Guard, the Police, supports the Center for the Disabled “Melissa” and the Corfu ambulance, but also non-profit organizations, sports clubs, and federations through Hellaktor. In 2022, he, his wife, and their son were honorary naturalized Greek citizens. The properties he has acquired in Corfu are not the only ones, as he has also made several purchases in Athens. In the capital, real estate insiders say Holterman has built up a substantial property portfolio, part of which was acquired by REDS, which paid €80 million to acquire Athens Properties from Holding Greece B.V., a company managed by the Holterman family. Hestia Luxury Apartments, a subsidiary of Athens Properties B.V., manages 10 fully renovated buildings in prime locations. It also owns other properties, in addition to those in Corfu and those owned by Hellaktor. Real estate, moreover, is one of his favorite investments. In the Netherlands, the couple Henry and Herita reside in an understated luxury residence in Holden, a picturesque town known for its natural beauty and the Sallandse Heuvelrug National Park. When it was acquired, it was worth under 1 million, while today it is priced several times that. His penchant for investing in real estate leads many to conclude that his next step after his successful deals in Greece with GEK Terna, Hellactor, and Alpha Bank will be real estate, specifically the creation of a property management company. Hellactor, following the sale of its assets (most recently Aktor Concessions), now has, through REDS, its most important asset, Alimos Marina, although there have been reports that its sale has been discussed, which remains to be seen if it is true. REDS, on the other hand, has agreed to sell to Dimand two of its very important projects, the project at Gournes in Heraklion, Crete, and the Cambas Project at Kantza, Pallini. The company still has several assets in Greece and abroad, with REDS getting into hotels as well, as together with SWOT they have entered into a 25-year lease of the hotel property on Kifissia Avenue (formerly “Civitel”), owned by the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which they are renovating, while they are also expected to collaborate on “Corfu Palace”. What is certain is that a few days ago, REDS Hospitality was established by the parent company REDS, owned by Hellaktor, in order to operate in the wider hospitality sector. In addition to the Hestia Luxury Apartments properties and hotels, other moves are being prepared, and it is no coincidence that REDS is participating in the ETAD’s tender for the long-term lease of Vouliagmeni Beach in a joint venture with the Melissanidis family’s Aegean Warehouses. These are the facts, with real estate coming to the fore. Beyond that, Reggeborgh, after selling its stake in Alpha Bank, said it will continue to invest in Greece. However, this is not 2018, when valuations were still low, the economy has taken the investment grade, and the stock market has hit 15-year highs again.

Retail Bob Etchingham Businessman Bob Etchingham, who founded Irish forecourt giant Applegreen, has resigned as a director of artisan food chain The Butler’s Pantry. The resignation has followed reports last year that the business had been sold. Both Bob and Sarah Etchingham resigned as directors from The Butler’s Pantry Holdings last week, a business the Applegreen chairman’s Belgrave Capital had owned. The pair remain as directors of The Butler’s Pantry (Manufacturing) Ltd. In December, accounts released by The Butler’s Pantry Holdings said the company was due to change hands at the end of 2024. Reports linked Natural Bakery owner Luke Creighan with the acquisition, but this was never confirmed. He is now the sole director of The Butler’s Pantry Holdings. “The new owners expect to derive synergies by incorporating The Butler’s Pantry Holdings Limited into their existing business and thereby improve the trading performance of the company,” the accounts read. The accounts said a share purchase agreement for the business was made with a third party on May 10, 2024. Creighan was appointed as a director later that same month. Creighan has built up a reputation in the franchising space, owning some Eurospar stores and Insomnia and Four Star Pizza franchises. He founded The Natural Bakery in 2013 and has since expanded it to 10 locations. The Sunday Independent attempted to email Creighan and a separate employee of The Natural Bakery to ask if he had bought The Butler’s Pantry but did not receive a response. Etchingham declined to comment. Etchingham first joined The Butler’s Pantry as a director in March 2016, building up a stake in the business through a separate investment company, Appletreewick Nominees. In 2019, Appletreewick increased its stake to 75pc in The Butler’s Pantry Holdings. It put €3.6m into the company around the same time as last May’s share purchase agreement. Etchingham made his millions with Applegreen, which was taken private by Blackstone Infrastructure Partners in a deal worth €718.1m back in December 2020. The Butler’s Pantry was set up in 1987 by Eileen Bergin and opened its first outlet on Mount Merrion Avenue in Blackrock. Jacquie Marsh subsequently took it over. The Butler’s Pantry 2023 accounts show a loss of €1.15m. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/07/2025 10:37:13 AM PDT by george76 Leaving the port of Darwin in Chinese hands would bestow on Beijing a golden opportunity to make mischief for Australia and its allies. Hooroo, China! Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is evidently making good on an election campaign pledge to reclaim the Port of Darwin, a harbor in Australia’s Northern Territory, from Chinese control. The Chinese firm Landbridge has operated the port since 2015 under a 99-year lease. Last week the American private-equity firm Cerberus voiced interest in leasing the port from Canberra. Albanese cited national security grounds for breaking the lease. Why Darwin Matters.. Why does Chinese control over Darwin’s port matter? First and foremost, Darwin occupies prime real estate. Maritime historian Alfred Thayer Mahan fashioned a trio of metrics to help naval officialdom judge the worth of any strategic position, chiefly candidate sites for naval bases. “Situation,” or geographic position, meant a site’s proximity to something naval commanders wanted to influence—a hostile base, an important seacoast, or a strategic waterway. “Strength” connoted some combination of natural and manmade defenses to hold enemies at bay. “Resources” referred to the port’s or surrounding countryside’s ability to furnish warships with fuel, ammunition, and stores of all types. Darwin measures up handily by Mahanian standards in all three metrics—strategic position in particular. It is Australia’s northernmost major harbor, situated along an outcropping of land jutting toward the rim of the South China Sea. Maritime forces stationed there enjoy a central position just outside the southerly arc of Asia’s first island chain, which meanders from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippine Islands, and the Indonesian archipelago before terminating at the Strait of Malacca. Of particular note, the Sunda and Lombok straits, the best alternative passages to Malacca, lie within reach of Darwin. Darwin Port’s fortunate position affords ships and aircraft liberty of horizontal movement. They can range from side to side on the map, helping seal off the first island chain to Chinese maritime and air movement. They also enjoy vertical access to the South China Sea, one of Asia’s and the world’s most embattled expanses. Small wonder, then, that some 2,500 US Marines from the I Marine Expeditionary Force now rotate through the port on an annual basis. Among other functions, these Marines are honing tactics for access denial while helping beleaguered allies like the Philippines uphold their nautical rights in the face of Chinese gray-zone aggression. On occasion, Darwin has also played host to US Navy attack submarines. Just this March, for instance, the attack boat USS Minnesota, accompanied by submarine tender Emory S. Land, put into the harbor for a port call. In short, Darwin occupies a strategic position of great price while boasting resources adequate to support seagoing forces. Leaving the port in Chinese hands would bestow on Beijing a golden opportunity to make mischief for Australia and its allies. At a bare minimum, Chinese observers could gather intelligence on Australian Defense Force and allied comings and goings while abetting net assessment of allied capabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures. In so doing, they help acquaint the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with potential foes, the first step toward defeating them. Nor is it farfetched to imagine Chinese port operators slow-rolling—or, more likely, actively hampering—allied military movements and resupply in wartime. Bear in mind that there is no such thing as an apolitical agreement with a Chinese company. Politics permeates everything in China; politics is warfare without bloodshed for the Chinese Communist Party; and domestic law obliges all Chinese firms, state-owned or not, to comply with party mandates on matters relating to national security. In other words, businesses constitute a geopolitical cudgel for Beijing as surely as the PLA does. And the party wields that weapon with zest on a 24/7/365 basis. So, kudos to Prime Minister Albanese for reasserting friendly dominion over Darwin Port. America Must Secure the Panama Canal, Too.. Not all maritime positions are created equal, as the Mahanian formula for gauging their value indicates. For instance, Darwin is less geopolitically pivotal than the Panama Canal, whose Pacific and Caribbean terminuses were, until recently, operated by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holding. Last winter, the Trump administration successfully pressured the Hong Kong firm to transfer the leases to a consortium including BlackRock Inc. If the Panamanian government approves the transaction—it remains in limbo for the time being—the strategically situated waterway will, in effect, come under American control. That matters because of a fourth index of a strategic position’s value that Mahan did not explicitly incorporate into his formula—namely, alternatives. If there is no alternative to a position, it commands peerless value. Hawai’i, which sits alone in the vacant Eastern Pacific, is one such site. There are relatively accessible alternatives to Darwin for Australia-based forces, though none so convenient for coping with today’s strategic seascape. The only alternatives to the Panama Canal for the United States are the Northwest Passage, skirting the Arctic flanks of Alaska and Canada, or around Cape Horn, circumnavigating South America. But the Northwest Passage route is largely impractical for naval maneuver, while the Cape Horn passage is slow, burdensome, and weather-beaten. Both routes encumber strategic mobility. Geopolitics maven Nicholas Spykman observed that digging the Panama Canal in effect rewrote Western Hemisphere maritime geography. In practical terms, by sparing merchantmen and ships of war the long voyage around South America, artificially modifying geography teleported American east-coast ports thousands of miles closer to East Asia. Traders could now compete with European rivals on a more equal footing because merchant ships’ journeys to Pacific trading partners were comparable in length and duration. Just as important, the US Navy could swing forces from side to side through the Caribbean Sea, concentrating and reconcentrating fleets in whichever ocean the leadership deemed most in need. If it persists, Chinese control of the canal threatens to repeal Spykman’s geographical revolution. Like Anthony Albanese, Donald Trump was wise to usher China away from crucial marine geography. Here’s hoping fellow leaders around the world follow suit, rethinking Chinese control of their seaports. After all, Mahan depicts sea power as a “chain” connecting domestic manufacturing—via domestic seaports—with foreign harbors across the sea. Economic prosperity and martial prowess depend on ports. A country that cedes control of its ports to China grants Beijing the option to snap its sea-power chain. Deliberately empowering an antagonist in this way courts ruin. Don’t let China break the chain.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Why does Chinese control over Darwin’s port matter? First and foremost, Darwin occupies prime real estate. Maritime historian Alfred Thayer Mahan fashioned a trio of metrics to help naval officialdom judge the worth of any strategic position, chiefly candidate sites for naval bases. “Situation,” or geographic position, meant a site’s proximity to something naval commanders wanted to influence—a hostile base, an important seacoast, or a strategic waterway. “Strength” connoted some combination of natural and manmade defenses to hold enemies at bay. “Resources” referred to the port’s or surrounding countryside’s ability to furnish warships with fuel, ammunition, and stores of all types. Darwin measures up handily by Mahanian standards in all three metrics—strategic position in particular. It is Australia’s northernmost major harbor, situated along an outcropping of land jutting toward the rim of the South China Sea. Maritime forces stationed there enjoy a central position just outside the southerly arc of Asia’s first island chain, which meanders from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippine Islands, and the Indonesian archipelago before terminating at the Strait of Malacca. Of particular note, the Sunda and Lombok straits, the best alternative passages to Malacca, lie within reach of Darwin. Darwin Port’s fortunate position affords ships and aircraft liberty of horizontal movement. They can range from side to side on the map, helping seal off the first island chain to Chinese maritime and air movement. They also enjoy vertical access to the South China Sea, one of Asia’s and the world’s most embattled expanses. Small wonder, then, that some 2,500 US Marines from the I Marine Expeditionary Force now rotate through the port on an annual basis. Among other functions, these Marines are honing tactics for access denial while helping beleaguered allies like the Philippines uphold their nautical rights in the face of Chinese gray-zone aggression. On occasion, Darwin has also played host to US Navy attack submarines. Just this March, for instance, the attack boat USS Minnesota, accompanied by submarine tender Emory S. Land, put into the harbor for a port call. In short, Darwin occupies a strategic position of great price while boasting resources adequate to support seagoing forces. Leaving the port in Chinese hands would bestow on Beijing a golden opportunity to make mischief for Australia and its allies. At a bare minimum, Chinese observers could gather intelligence on Australian Defense Force and allied comings and goings while abetting net assessment of allied capabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures. In so doing, they help acquaint the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with potential foes, the first step toward defeating them. Nor is it farfetched to imagine Chinese port operators slow-rolling—or, more likely, actively hampering—allied military movements and resupply in wartime. Bear in mind that there is no such thing as an apolitical agreement with a Chinese company. Politics permeates everything in China; politics is warfare without bloodshed for the Chinese Communist Party; and domestic law obliges all Chinese firms, state-owned or not, to comply with party mandates on matters relating to national security. In other words, businesses constitute a geopolitical cudgel for Beijing as surely as the PLA does. And the party wields that weapon with zest on a 24/7/365 basis. So, kudos to Prime Minister Albanese for reasserting friendly dominion over Darwin Port. America Must Secure the Panama Canal, Too.. Not all maritime positions are created equal, as the Mahanian formula for gauging their value indicates. For instance, Darwin is less geopolitically pivotal than the Panama Canal, whose Pacific and Caribbean terminuses were, until recently, operated by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holding. Last winter, the Trump administration successfully pressured the Hong Kong firm to transfer the leases to a consortium including BlackRock Inc. If the Panamanian government approves the transaction—it remains in limbo for the time being—the strategically situated waterway will, in effect, come under American control. That matters because of a fourth index of a strategic position’s value that Mahan did not explicitly incorporate into his formula—namely, alternatives. If there is no alternative to a position, it commands peerless value. Hawai’i, which sits alone in the vacant Eastern Pacific, is one such site. There are relatively accessible alternatives to Darwin for Australia-based forces, though none so convenient for coping with today’s strategic seascape. The only alternatives to the Panama Canal for the United States are the Northwest Passage, skirting the Arctic flanks of Alaska and Canada, or around Cape Horn, circumnavigating South America. But the Northwest Passage route is largely impractical for naval maneuver, while the Cape Horn passage is slow, burdensome, and weather-beaten. Both routes encumber strategic mobility.

America Must Secure the Panama Canal, Too.. Not all maritime positions are created equal, as the Mahanian formula for gauging their value indicates. For instance, Darwin is less geopolitically pivotal than the Panama Canal, whose Pacific and Caribbean terminuses were, until recently, operated by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holding. Last winter, the Trump administration successfully pressured the Hong Kong firm to transfer the leases to a consortium including BlackRock Inc. If the Panamanian government approves the transaction—it remains in limbo for the time being—the strategically situated waterway will, in effect, come under American control. That matters because of a fourth index of a strategic position’s value that Mahan did not explicitly incorporate into his formula—namely, alternatives. If there is no alternative to a position, it commands peerless value. Hawai’i, which sits alone in the vacant Eastern Pacific, is one such site. There are relatively accessible alternatives to Darwin for Australia-based forces, though none so convenient for coping with today’s strategic seascape. The only alternatives to the Panama Canal for the United States are the Northwest Passage, skirting the Arctic flanks of Alaska and Canada, or around Cape Horn, circumnavigating South America. But the Northwest Passage route is largely impractical for naval maneuver, while the Cape Horn passage is slow, burdensome, and weather-beaten. Both routes encumber strategic mobility. Geopolitics maven Nicholas Spykman observed that digging the Panama Canal in effect rewrote Western Hemisphere maritime geography. In practical terms, by sparing merchantmen and ships of war the long voyage around South America, artificially modifying geography teleported American east-coast ports thousands of miles closer to East Asia. Traders could now compete with European rivals on a more equal footing because merchant ships’ journeys to Pacific trading partners were comparable in length and duration. Just as important, the US Navy could swing forces from side to side through the Caribbean Sea, concentrating and reconcentrating fleets in whichever ocean the leadership deemed most in need. If it persists, Chinese control of the canal threatens to repeal Spykman’s geographical revolution. Like Anthony Albanese, Donald Trump was wise to usher China away from crucial marine geography. Here’s hoping fellow leaders around the world follow suit, rethinking Chinese control of their seaports. After all, Mahan depicts sea power as a “chain” connecting domestic manufacturing—via domestic seaports—with foreign harbors across the sea. Economic prosperity and martial prowess depend on ports. A country that cedes control of its ports to China grants Beijing the option to snap its sea-power chain. Deliberately empowering an antagonist in this way courts ruin. Don’t let China break the chain.

Title: Globalists Go Radio Silent As NATO Flirts With World War III

Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

The Hate Industry is still alive in the US and across the West. The politics of Hate has divided individuals, countries and the world - you can almost trace it’s ugly emergance on the world scene with Obama’s presidency as it errupted in the States. I have been overseas since 1999 when Obama was election and did not return to live until 2011 - gone for 12 years and I didn’t recognize the US when I got home. The racist hate was everywhere. I had gone from working with all races oversea to returning to a country where race defined benefits, schooling and even if you could be a racist - how the American people were lulled into this is anyone’s guess.

The reason that Russian and USA and NATO strategic bombers are parked in plain sight is so Russian and USA spy satellites can keep track of the exact number that exist. This tracking system is part of nuclear weapon agreements signed by Russia, USA, and NATO. The bombers Ukraine destroyed are part of Russia's nuclear arsenal. It is likely that NONE of the destroyed Russian planes ever dropped a conventional bomb on Ukraine. If NATO or USA intelligence assisted Ukraine in this attack, that is INSANE provocation against Russia. 19 posted on 06/07/2025 12:16:16 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned.

USAID was the end of the Global Homo Agenda and the Homsexual/LGBT movement here at home. The race baiting industry has collasped without lawsuits for injury and public funds to pay fines. The Hate Industry is still alive in the US and across the West. The politics of Hate has divided individuals, countries and the world - you can almost trace it’s ugly emergance on the world scene with Obama’s presidency as it errupted in the States. I have been overseas since 1999 when Obama was election and did not return to live until 2011 - gone for 12 years and I didn’t recognize the US when I got home. The racist hate was everywhere. I had gone from working with all races oversea to returning to a country where race defined benefits, schooling and even if you could be a racist - how the American people were lulled into this is anyone’s guess. But the fear of the elites across the west is evident. 16 posted on 06/07/2025 11:58:40 AM PDT by Jumper [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: DIRTYSECRET They killed Sadat.

The reason that Russian and USA and NATO strategic bombers are parked in plain sight is so Russian and USA spy satellites can keep track of the exact number that exist. This tracking system is part of nuclear weapon agreements signed by Russia, USA, and NATO. The bombers Ukraine destroyed are part of Russia's nuclear arsenal. It is likely that NONE of the destroyed Russian planes ever dropped a conventional bomb on Ukraine. If NATO or USA intelligence assisted Ukraine in this attack, that is INSANE provocation against Russia. 19 posted on 06/07/2025 12:16:16 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair.

As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence.

Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Title: Bitcoin vs. macro pressure – Is $100K still safe amid rate-cut bets, inflation risks?

Full Content:
June’s volatility may shake out weak hands in the crypto market. Bitcoin’s [BTC] resilience has been on full display lately. Despite a barrage of macro noise, rate cut odds, Trump’s Fed shakeup tease, and institutional reshuffling, BTC is still trading above $100,000 on the charts. And in doing so, it has kept FOMO on a low simmer without flipping into euphoria. Such a setup screams bullish continuation. You see, we’re halfway through 2025, and the market’s leaning hard into the rate-cut narrative – 97.4% odds for a cut at the next FOMC. That’s a big vote of confidence. However, here’s the thing – What if the Fed doesn’t budge? What if the CPI ticks higher and inflation throws a wrench in the plan? Mid-June could get messy. On the contrary, if BTC retains its strength, it could set the tone for a breakout heading into the second half of the year. May’s Non-Farm Payrolls report came in solid. 139,000 jobs added vs. 125,000 expected, though slightly below April’s 147,000. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.2%, highlighting a steady but healthy labor market. Source: Trading Economics Skeptics might argue that this strong employment data contradicts the idea of a rate-cut pivot. After all, why lower borrowing costs when economic activity is stable? David Hernandez, Crypto Investment Specialist at 21Shares, told AMBCrypto, “BTC has found solid footing above the meaningful $100,000 support level, with each day spent above this level strengthening it as a foundation for future upward moves.” He added that Bitcoin’s ability to hold through volatility reflects growing institutional conviction. Especially with the Fed funds market pricing in near-100% odds of a pause this June. Simply put, stable labor data means inflation pressures are manageable without more tightening. This gives the Fed room to pause rate hikes. In turn, it also encourages investment flows into risk-on assets like Bitcoin. As the U.S. economy continues to tame inflationary pressures with a string of “better-than-expected” data, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Fed holds rates steady at the upcoming meeting. However, what about those 97.4% odds priced in? Well, that’s why Bitcoin’s resilience matters. While short-term volatility is inevitable as investors reposition ahead of the Fed’s decision, BTC’s ability to hold the $100k-level keeps FOMO intact. It also validates its structural support. In fact, we’ve seen this dynamic play out repeatedly over the past two weeks. Despite BlackRock reducing its exposure, Bitcoin hasn’t flinched. Holding six figures in the face of institutional distribution underscores just how solid BTC’s macro setup really is. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) In an unexpected twist, Trump teased a new Fed Chair pick recently, despite Powell’s term running until 2026. Source: The Kobeissi Letter His comments added fuel to the speculative fire and helped push crypto markets up 2.5% over 24 hours – Alongside $35 million in short liquidations. But if this is just hype—and not substance—there’s a risk this relief rally fades just as fast. If CPI stays contained and the Fed delivers the expected pause, this base at $100k will become launchpad territory. On the other hand, if the market’s pricing proves premature, we could see a volatility shakeout before the next leg. Right now, Bitcoin isn’t breaking down – It’s loading up. And, if the macro deck falls into place, the next breakout may not just reclaim highs, but rewrite them.

Title: Ganesh Housing: Why this small-cap company is still investment worthy

While demand for housing and especially office space is robust in metros, there is considerable action even in other larger cities. Gujarat as a State, with strong infrastructure presence in cities such as Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, has seen a strong uptick in realty demand in recent years. Some softness, in line with the moderating demand in the overall economy, was witnessed in FY25. However, premium housing demand and commercial office spaces (due to Global Capability Centres, Gifty City etc.) is robust in the cities mentioned above. Ganesh Housing Corporation, a mid-sized builder and developer of commercial and residential properties continues to be well-placed to cater to this demand in light of its extensive presence in these pockets. From our recommendation in July 2024 at ₹1,039, the stock rose to ₹1,480-levels, before correcting 30 per cent in the broader market fall, especially in the small-cap segment. At ₹1,022, the stock trades at just 12 times its likely per share earnings for FY26. This is among the lowest valuation multiples commanded by any real estate company with even mid-sized operations. The BSE Realty trades at a PE of nearly 54 times. A strong track record of timely execution of projects, healthy pipeline of commercial and residential properties, focus on annuity revenues and debt-free balance sheet are positives for Ganesh Housing. Investors with a two-three-year perspective can buy the shares of the company at the current price. In FY25, the company’s revenue from operations grew 7.6 per cent year on year to ₹960 crore, while net profits rose 30 per cent to ₹598 crore. It enjoyed an EBITDA margin of over 80 per cent in FY25. Ganesh Housing is a premium developer of commercial and residential properties focused mainly on Ahmedabad. The company has completed 18 residential and four commercial projects over the years, spread over 23 million sq ft. It currently has two ongoing projects, of which one is residential and the other is commercial (Million Minds Phase 1). About 2 million sq ft would be built by March 2027 with total expected sales value of ₹1,350 crore. Then, there are four planned projects spread across residential, commercial and township constructions to the tune of 30.5 million sqft. These projects will start from September 2025 and go on for another 10 years. The total sale value from these projects is a ₹16,000 crore. Ganesh Housing has a strategic partnership with Tishman Speyer for Million Minds commercial projects, given the experience it has in developed markets, having worked with reputed clients such as Meta, Amazon, LinkedIn and even top Indian companies. The Million Minds (IT SEZ) Phase 1 project – expected to be completed by March 2026 – is quite lucrative as each phase would generate about ₹ 72 crore in lease income every year. This construction would be funded from internal accruals, without taking any external debt. In other finished projects, Malabar County 3 and Malabar Exotica are both 100 per cent completed and 100 per cent booked. Possession has generally been on time or ahead of schedule. One Thaltej, a commercial project with 1.8 million sq ft construction and ₹2,114-crore revenue potential is under final stages of approval. Smile City 1 and Smile City 2 are township projects planned in Godhavi, Ahmedabad. The latter could generate as much as ₹4,550 crore in revenues by H1FY31. In all, over the next several years, there is a robust pipeline of projects with considerable revenue visibility. Ahmedabad itself is a robust real estate market, especially after the emergence of the Gift City, rolled out by the Central government. It draws 42 per cent of the total investment into Gujarat. Inventory overhang has reduced from 15 months in FY24 from 25 months in FY21, and per square feet rates have nearly doubled from CY20-25 to nearly ₹20,000-levels, according to Knight Frank and PropEquity data. After a period of turbulence around Covid and for a year after the pandemic, Ganesh Housing was straddled with slow growth and high debt. However, with four continuous years of rising profits, the company has not only registered top-notch EBITDA margins for the past three fiscals, but has also managed to become debt free for two years in a row. The company’s return on equity has more than tripled over FY22 to FY25, from 8.9 per cent to 29.1 per cent in FY25. Return on capital employed is higher at 38.7 per cent as of FY25. It also has a cash surplus of ₹157 crore, despite spending ₹216 crore for SEZ Phase 1 construction entirely from internal accruals.

Title: Telegram Raises $1.7B Via Convertible Bonds: Bloomberg

Editor Tech CoinDesk, Francisco Rodrigues The messaging app, with over 1 billion users, plans to use $955 million to buy back existing bonds and the remaining $745 million for growth. Telegram has secured $1.7 billion by issuing five-year convertible bonds, aiming to refinance existing liabilities and push out repayment deadlines. The messaging app, which now counts over 1 billion users, will use $955 million of the new funds to buy back bonds maturing in 2026, Bloomberg reports. The remaining $745 million gives the company fresh capital to bolster its operations or invest in growth. Investors in the new bonds will have a shot at converting their holdings into equity if Telegram goes public before the notes mature. In that scenario, they would be entitled to redeem at 80% of the initial public offering price. The tender offer closed May 28, with settlement expected on June 5. CoinDesk previously reported the round drew interest from from both returning investors such as the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, as well as new entrants including hedge fund Citadel The notes carry a 9% coupon, two percentage points above Telegram’s previous $2.35 billion bond issued in 2021. Telegram passed $1 billion in revenue last year and holds over $500 million in cash reserves, excluding crypto, Bloomberg’s report adds.

Title: Ray-Ban Meta Glasses drop to a record-low price!

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. June 6, 2025 I’ve been thinking about getting a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, but man, are they pricey. I’ve been hoping to catch a good deal on them, and it seems the time has come! The most common model is the Matte Black version with Polarized Gradient Graphite glasses, and you can currently save $65.80 on them, bringing the price to a more reasonable $263.20. Get the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses Wayfarer for $263.20 ($65.80 off) This offer is available from Amazon. This specific discount applies to the regular-sized, Matte Black version with Polarized Gradient Graphite glasses. That said, most other iterations are also on sale. In fact, the Shiny Black / G15 Green version is even cheaper at $239.20. We didn’t feature it because it’s a less popular model. The Ray-Ban Meta Glasses Wayfarer are awesome. These offer a simple way to access a digital assistant to request music, ask for information, and more. You can also record clips using the cameras, or even get live translation, getting rid of that language barrier that keeps so many of us from communicating efficiently. These are genuinely a look into what the future can be like. They are a bit pricey, though. I like that pretty much all models are at a discount right now. That said, we’re wondering why they are on sale. Is a new version coming out soon? Either way, the current Ray-Ban Meta Glasses are still awesome. It’s one of those things you don’t really understand until you test it. Being able to record and send clips to your friends will become a breeze. Not to mention, they can help you throughout your day, harnessing the power of Meta AI. By the way, they are available in regular and large sizes, with a bevy of options for the actual glasses. You can even get prescribed glasses installed! I happen to be a fan of the transition lenses, which will be clear, but can turn darker when the sun is out. And I mean, if you think about it, the price isn’t too outrageous considering everything these glasses can do. People already pay a pretty penny for non-smart Ray-Bans! Take advantage of this deal while you can. These are record-low prices, and we’re not sure how long the sale will last. They may be getting rid of extra stock to make room for new models!

아빠찬스 Here are five key takeaways from the US jobs report for May https://t.co/URzOFQM4zF ICYMI: A hiring freeze that impedes the Bureau of Labor Statistics may cost Americans a lot more than the government saves.Read @JonathanJLevin ⬇️https://t.co/RVpvbz2BhX 트럼프 노동부에서 발표한 5월 비농업 '고용 보고서'('NFP')에 따르면 '일자리' 증가율은 이전 두 달에 비해 총 95,000명 감소한 후 139,000명 증가하면서 '둔화'되었고 전월은 하향 조정되었지만 실업률은 4.2%로 변동없이 안정적으로 '유지'되었습니다. NFP 보고서는 고소득 노동자의 임금이 포함되는 등 시장금리 대장지표라 불립니다. Lori Chavez-DeRemer '노동부 장관'은 일자리 보고서에 관해 "지난 몇 달 동안 우리가 본 것은 미국 태생의 미국인들이 일자리 증가가 일어나고 있다는 것입니다. 우리는 먼저 미국 노동자를 보호하고 있는지 확인하고 싶습니다."라고 말하였습니다.

The evening before its Thursday trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange, Circle priced its stock, CRCL, at $31 a share. That represented a mark-up from the lower share prices the firm floated earlier in the week: $26, and then $28. Such last-minute moves are generally indicative of increased investor interest in a company’s stock market debut. But nothing could have prepared Wall Street for the stablecoin issuer’s bombshell first-day performance. Within minutes of the market’s opening, CRCL more than tripled in price, and experienced such volatility that the New York Stock Exchange had to halt trading on the stock multiple times. By the end of Thursday's trading day, the price of Circle sat at $82.84—up 167% from the offering price. On Friday, CRCL hit a new high of $123.51, coming within cents of fully quadrupling its IPO price. Among other flashy tech IPOs of recent years, that performance is a standout. While some American tech giants may be worth more than Circle, few have shattered early trading expectations to such an extent. Meta, formerly Facebook, for example, IPO’d at $38 back in 2012. After its first day of trading, the company’s stock remained stagnant at $38.23, disappointing investors. That price nonetheless valued Facebook at a monster $104 billion, though—far more than the $19 billion valuation Circle scored yesterday, even with overperformance factored in. Uber, another tech giant with a hotly anticipated IPO, failed to meet expectations after its Wall Street debut in 2019. The disruptive rideshare startup priced its stock at $45, but failed to drum up enough excitement on its first day of trading. UBER shed 8% that afternoon, closing under $42. But the company’s valuation at that point was still nothing to scoff at: $69.7 billion. It’s a similar story in fintech. When Robinhood launched its stock in July 2021, the new-age financial services company aimed for an opening price per share of $38. HOOD’s stock ended its first day of trading down over 8%, at $34.82, leaving the company with a market capitalization of $32 billion. Even when major tech stocks have outperformed analyst expectations, they’ve typically done so by smaller margins than Circle achieved this week. In 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbnb’s stock more than doubled its IPO price on opening day, surging from $68 to $144.71 by the closing bell. That 112% jump was heralded at the time as a fairytale success story—but still, did not approach Circle’s first-day result. Scale again, though, is an important caveat: Airbnb’s first day of trading valued the company at a whopping $100.7 billion. What accounts for Circle’s distinctive overperformance on Wall Street this week? Analysts told Decrypt the stock fared so well thanks not only to excitement surrounding stablecoins, which may soon be greenlit for a wide range of applications by Congress; but also due to the fact that Circle’s stock currently represents one of the only means for institutions and retail traders to invest in the emergent sector. The company’s competitors, namely market leader Tether, are not publicly traded.

The evening before its Thursday trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange, Circle priced its stock, CRCL, at $31 a share. That represented a mark-up from the lower share prices the firm floated earlier in the week: $26, and then $28. Such last-minute moves are generally indicative of increased investor interest in a company’s stock market debut. But nothing could have prepared Wall Street for the stablecoin issuer’s bombshell first-day performance. Within minutes of the market’s opening, CRCL more than tripled in price, and experienced such volatility that the New York Stock Exchange had to halt trading on the stock multiple times. By the end of Thursday's trading day, the price of Circle sat at $82.84—up 167% from the offering price. On Friday, CRCL hit a new high of $123.51, coming within cents of fully quadrupling its IPO price. Among other flashy tech IPOs of recent years, that performance is a standout. While some American tech giants may be worth more than Circle, few have shattered early trading expectations to such an extent. Meta, formerly Facebook, for example, IPO’d at $38 back in 2012. After its first day of trading, the company’s stock remained stagnant at $38.23, disappointing investors. That price nonetheless valued Facebook at a monster $104 billion, though—far more than the $19 billion valuation Circle scored yesterday, even with overperformance factored in. Uber, another tech giant with a hotly anticipated IPO, failed to meet expectations after its Wall Street debut in 2019. The disruptive rideshare startup priced its stock at $45, but failed to drum up enough excitement on its first day of trading. UBER shed 8% that afternoon, closing under $42. But the company’s valuation at that point was still nothing to scoff at: $69.7 billion. It’s a similar story in fintech. When Robinhood launched its stock in July 2021, the new-age financial services company aimed for an opening price per share of $38. HOOD’s stock ended its first day of trading down over 8%, at $34.82, leaving the company with a market capitalization of $32 billion. Even when major tech stocks have outperformed analyst expectations, they’ve typically done so by smaller margins than Circle achieved this week. In 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbnb’s stock more than doubled its IPO price on opening day, surging from $68 to $144.71 by the closing bell. That 112% jump was heralded at the time as a fairytale success story—but still, did not approach Circle’s first-day result. Scale again, though, is an important caveat: Airbnb’s first day of trading valued the company at a whopping $100.7 billion. What accounts for Circle’s distinctive overperformance on Wall Street this week? Analysts told Decrypt the stock fared so well thanks not only to excitement surrounding stablecoins, which may soon be greenlit for a wide range of applications by Congress; but also due to the fact that Circle’s stock currently represents one of the only means for institutions and retail traders to invest in the emergent sector. The company’s competitors, namely market leader Tether, are not publicly traded.

Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher to close out the trading week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, topping economists' forecasts and helping alleviate concerns about a tariff-driven slowdown in the labor market. The S&P 500 gained 1% on Friday, closing above the 6,000-point level for the first time since February. The Dow was up 1.1%, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.2%. Shares of big data analytics software provider Palantir Technologies (PLTR) popped 6.5% higher, securing the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Positivity around its expanding government business helped lift Palantir to an all-time high on Tuesday, but before Friday's gains, the stock had been pulling back for a couple of sessions. Palantir and other artificial intelligence companies benefited from upbeat sentiment after earnings results from chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) revealed strong AI demand. Moderna (MRNA) shares wrapped up a volatile week of trading with a gain of 5.1% on Friday. The biotech company announced at the end of last week that it had received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the use of its new COVID-19 vaccine by older and higher-risk patients. On Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Moderna had agreed to a placebo-controlled trial of the vaccine. United Airlines (UAL) announced a partnership with Spotify Technology (SPOT) that will allow airborne passengers to access playlists, audiobooks, and video podcasts from the streaming service on their seatback screens. United shares increased 4.8% on Friday, while rival carrier Delta Air Lines (DAL) shares were up 4.3%. Tesla (TSLA) shares advanced 3.7% on Friday as the feud between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation heading into the weekend. The spat between the two contributed to a major drop in the electric vehicle (EV) maker's stock in the prior session. Several analysts reaffirmed their bullishness on Tesla despite the high-profile conflict, but they noted that the tensions with Trump could complicate the regulatory path for the firm's self-driving technology or risk alienating people with certain political perspectives. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) issued lower-than-expected sales and profit guidance for the current quarter and trimmed its full-year profit forecast. The maker of yoga attire and other athletic apparel noted that U.S. consumers are taking a cautious approach to spending and discussed plans to increase prices on some products as it aims to mitigate tariff impacts. Lululemon shares plunged 19.8% on Friday, dropping the most of any constituent in the S&P 500. JPMorgan and UBS analysts cut their price targets on Lululemon stock following the underwhelming outlook. Broadcom posted fiscal second-quarter sales and adjusted profit results that were roughly in line with consensus forecasts. A major year-over-year uptick in artificial intelligence semiconductor revenue helped the chipmaker achieve record quarterly revenue of $15 billion. However, Broadcom shares slipped 5% on Friday, receding from a string of record highs notched before the earnings release. Mosaic (MOS), a provider of fertilizers and other agricultural products, reduced its 2025 phosphate production guidance, citing operational issues at its U.S. facilities. Shares of Mosaic were down 4.4%.

Not long ago, the term stablecoin lived mostly in crypto chatrooms and blockchain white papers. Today, it’s increasingly being discussed at financial summits, boardrooms of global tech giants and even in the halls of the U.S. Congress.

Δ In the arc of the blockchain sector’s maturation, if bitcoin was the rebel in a hoodie, stablecoins are the FinTech pros in tailored suits. Tethered to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, they aim to bring the speed and borderless nature of crypto with the reliability and predictability of traditional money. Now, banks, payment providers and Big Tech firms are racing to embrace, or at least to understand, how stablecoins might streamline operations, unlock new markets and even reshape macroeconomic structures. At least, that’s the industry direction the news this week was pointing toward. Read more: Customer Needs Remain North Star for Stablecoin Payment Innovation Many challenges remain, including U.S. regulation and integration hurdles. But there has been no clearer sign thus far that, in 2025, stablecoins are moving into the mainstream than the Thursday (June 5) news that Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, made its public listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Priced at $31 per share, Circle’s stock surged to close at $83.23 on its first day, tripling its value and signaling robust investor confidence in the future of regulated digital assets. As of reporting on Friday (June 6), Circle’s share price was up to $111. What’s powering the rise? Among the key uses cases beyond crypto market trading, cross-border transactions may top the list from a proof-of-concept standpoint. For instance, BVNK and LianLian Global have partnered to facilitate stablecoin-powered cross-border payments. Merchants can deposit stablecoins, which are then automatically converted to U.S. dollars and routed through LianLian’s extensive network, significantly reducing settlement times from days to minutes. Similarly, Uber is exploring the use of stablecoins for international money transfers. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted their potential to reduce costs and improve efficiency in cross-border transactions, making them an attractive option for global operations. PYMNTS covered how small banks can often face challenges in offering competitive cross-border payment services due to reliance on intermediaries and outdated infrastructure. Stablecoins and digital wallets offer a solution by enabling faster, lower-cost and more transparent international transactions. Beyond consumer payments, stablecoins are making inroads into B2B transactions. As of early 2025, B2B stablecoin transactions accounted for $36 billion, surpassing peer-to-peer and card-linked uses. The appeal lies in the speed, cost-efficiency and stability stablecoins can offer, particularly in regions where traditional banking systems are less reliable. In Latin America and Africa, businesses are leveraging stablecoins to sidestep currency devaluation and cross-border delays, replacing cumbersome wire networks with faster, more efficient alternatives. See also: Making Stablecoins ‘Grandma-Friendly’ Large and global financial institutions are also eyeing the potential of stablecoins. Deutsche Bank, for example, is exploring the use of stablecoins and tokenized deposits. Even mainstream consumer-facing platforms are joining the conversation. Airbnb is reportedly engaging in pilot discussions. And Apple and Google Cloud, while not launching tokens themselves, are participating in early-stage forums around how stablecoins might integrate with their cloud payment services. On the regulatory front, the U.S. government is moving toward establishing a framework for these digital currencies. Legislation under consideration would require stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets like U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, enhancing their legitimacy and potentially increasing demand for government debt. In this model, money isn’t just a medium of exchange — it becomes a piece of software for business transactions. Read also: Going From Zero to Crypto: How Banks and PSPs Can Approach Stablecoins But the potential of this currency comes with equally sizable risk. As stablecoin issuers hold substantial amounts of U.S. Treasuries, their growth could influence demand and volatility in the Treasury market. From banks to Big Tech, from Capitol Hill to Lagos, the question is no longer whether stablecoins matter — it’s how to build, regulate and scale them responsibly. They have potential to be neither hype nor panacea, but rather a bridge — between old money and new, between local markets and global liquidity.

Title: XOVR ETF Adds Anduril, Joining SpaceX to Offer Pre-IPO Access

June 06, 2025 15:48 ET | Source: EntrepreneurShares EntrepreneurShares NEW YORK, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ERShares, the first Crossover ETF that offers retail investors access to Private companies, with SpaceX as its top weight, is ushering in the next generation of investing with a new private equity position in Anduril Industries. Through the XOVR ETF, which primarily invests (85% +) in the US Entrepreneurial Large Cap ER30TR Index, ERShares continues ...its pursuit to provide retail investors access to private equity—which we believe offers exposure to high-growth, entrepreneurial companies typically reserved for institutions and high net worth investors, and does so at the same pricing available to those accredited investors. XOVR complies with SEC guidelines by keeping private equity exposure under 15%, with over 85% of the portfolio tracking the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR)—built on ERShares’ proprietary Entrepreneur model, applied to public markets for more than two decades. Given its weighting, the ER30TR Index drives the majority of XOVR’s return, while the private holdings offer potential upside and added diversification. Private equity investments can experience significant price swings—both upward and downward—over extended periods, even if valuations are not marked frequently. Additionally, private equities are inherently less liquid and less transparent than their public counterparts, resulting in higher risk profiles despite comparable market capitalizations. As with all investments, public equities can be volatile, though they have historically offered meaningful return potential over time. Private companies may magnify both opportunity and risk, which is why ERShares encourages investors to consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. To help manage risk, ERShares applies structured parameters around the size and scope of its private holdings. The due diligence process for these positions mirrors the same rigorous methodology used in constructing the ER30TR Index—adapted for private markets. Relaunched on August 29, 2024, XOVR became the first ETF to blend public equities with private equity holdings – potentially delivering diversified, liquid access to both high-growth public companies and elite pre-IPO firms. This ETF Crossover structure helps bridge two previously disconnected markets in one transparent vehicle. On May 30, 2025, ERShares initiated a $3M (approx. 1%) investment in Anduril, marking XOVR’s third private equity holding - after SpaceX ($33M, approx. 10%) and Klarna ($2M, less than 1%) - and establishing Anduril as its second-largest private position. The move reflects ERShares’ conviction in companies that sit at the intersection of innovation, national importance, and scalable disruption. The position was selected after extensive internal research and due diligence, consistent with ERShares’ proprietary Venture Capital-style framework for evaluating private and public companies. “Our proprietary research model identifies category-defining companies before they go public,” said Dr. Joel Shulman, Founder and CIO of ERShares. “Anduril embodies the deep tech leadership and mission-driven innovation we seek for XOVR.” ERShares also recently increased its SpaceX position at $185 per share - matching its previous entries - to reaffirm confidence in the company’s valuation amid market speculation. Bridging Public and Private Markets “We’re not just following innovation - we’re positioning investors at its source,” said Eva Ados, Chief Investment Strategist at ERShares. “Whether private or public, our focus is on trying to identify the next Magnificent Seven (The "Magnificent 7" currently refers to a group of seven large-cap, high-growth U.S. technology companies: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA))—those rare, transformational companies that have the potential to shape entire decades of innovation and growth.” Anduril Industries: The Next Generation of Defense Technology Founded by Palmer Luckey - creator of Oculus and a key early collaborator with Palantir - Anduril Industries represents the next generation of defense technology. Anduril is rapidly becoming foundational to U.S. military modernization initiatives. Transparent Valuation Backed by Research ERShares uses a structured valuation methodology to price private equity holdings - drawing from tender offers, internal transactions, IPO indicators, and comparables – to help ensure pricing is fair, consistent, and market-aware. This framework helps protect investors while maintaining daily liquidity and regulatory compliance. Investing in the Future - Before the IPO With positions in SpaceX, Klarna, and now Anduril, XOVR remains the only ETF offering diversified access to potentially high growth private companies alongside expanding public innovators. The fund allows investors to participate in the potential next wave of value creation - before it goes public. “We built XOVR to give retail investors access to leading private companies at the critical pre-IPO stage,” added Dr. Shulman. “It is time they participate in the value creation that was once reserved only for institutions and accredited investors.” Past performance is no guarantee of future results, please refer to the disclosures below for important risk information: https://entrepreneurshares.com/disclosures/ All investing involves risk, including potential loss of principal.

Title: How Netflix’s ad business could become a $10 billion sleeper hit

Netflix (NFLX) was once allergic to ads. Now it might be growing its empire on them. Back in 2022, the company’s decision to launch an ad-supported tier felt more like a concession than a strategy — a move that came as password crackdowns replaced product launches and was driven by slowing subscriber growth, rising competition, and economic pressure. Fast forward to mid-2025 and that “standard with ads” plan looks less like a reluctant experiment and more like a $10 billion franchise in the making. Netflix’s ad-supported tier now boasts greater than 94 million global monthly active users, more than doubling from 40 million just the year before, according to the company. In regions where that tier is available, over 40% of new subscribers are choosing the cheaper, ad-supported option — showing that viewers are happy to trade a few commercials for a lower monthly bill. Among these users, 44% are new to Netflix, 40% downgraded from pricier ad-free plans, and 16% are returning subscribers, per The Wrap. Jefferies (JEF) analysts estimate that Netflix’s advertising business could hit $10 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade, and Wall Street is finally catching up to the plot twist. In a June note, Jefferies raised its price target on Netflix to $1,400, citing, among other things, the “infancy” of the ad business and its massive runway for growth. Oppenheimer (OPY) analysts are even more bullish in the short term, forecasting $6 billion in ad revenue by 2025 — up from a previous $4.6 billion estimate. That’s not pocket change for a company that built its brand on being the “ad-free” TV option. Netflix’s transformation into a hybrid media-advertising platform mirrors broader shifts in the streaming landscape. According to data from analysts at Antenna, nearly half of streaming subscriptions across major platforms are now ad-supported. Consumers, it turns out, are willing to watch a few commercials if it means saving a few bucks — and advertisers are eager to reach them in a post-cable world. Still, Netflix wasn’t the first to adopt this model. Hulu (DIS), Peacock (CMCSA), and Paramount+ (PARA) had ad-supported offerings years earlier. But Netflix’s scale gives it an edge: a global subscriber base, premium content, and hit franchises such as “Bridgerton,” and increasingly, the infrastructure to sell those ads with surgical precision. The company recently began building an ad-tech platform with plans to launch it globally by the end of 2025. Netflix has also inked partnerships with major programmatic players such as The Trade Desk (TTD), Google’s DV360, and Magnite (MGNI) to streamline ad sales and targeting. The appeal to advertisers is obvious. Netflix offers premium, brand-safe content in a streaming environment that’s becoming increasingly fragmented and unpredictable. And the company’s ad business still represents a small slice of total revenue — an estimated $2 billion in 2025. But that’s the point: There’s room to grow. MoffettNathanson (SIVB) sees Netflix’s advertising revenue climbing past $6 billion by 2027, on track for $10 billion by 2030. For comparison, YouTube (GOOGL) generated over $40 billion in ad revenue last year. Even capturing a small fraction of that puts Netflix in a different league than most of its streaming peers. And Wall Street is paying attention. The ad model, combined with a blockbuster second-half content slate — “Squid Game” season three, the “Stranger Things” finale, and even NFL games and other live offerings — is fueling bullish sentiment on the stock. Analysts expect free cash flow to grow at a 20% compound annual rate over the next five years, reaching $18 billion by the end of the decade. Advertising, Wall Street seems to be arguing, is the high-margin lever that could supercharge those numbers — while the company remains a strong, recession-safe play. It also offers Netflix pricing flexibility. Rather than hiking monthly rates across the board (a tactic that’s historically sparked churn), the company can nudge users toward the ad tier while still growing average revenue per member (ARM). So far, it seems to be working: Churn from price increases has been “limited,” per Jefferies, and ARM is rising. In early 2025, Netflix raised the price of its ad-supported plan from $6.99 to $7.99 (the standard plan without ads from $15.49 to $17.99; and the premium tier without ads from $22.99 to $24.99). Unlike previous hikes, this one didn’t trigger a mass exodus. That’s good news for the company’s margins — and even better news for its ambitions to grow the ad-supported tier without sacrificing user growth. There are, of course, still caveats. Some analysts worry that the ad tier might cannibalize higher-paying subscribers, dragging down margins. Others point to the fact that the costs of live sports and entertainment rights could weigh on profitability (just ask ESPN). And unlike tech-native platforms such as Meta (META) or Google, Netflix has only recently begun building the backend that powers programmatic ad targeting at scale. But if Netflix can thread the needle — retaining its brand while scaling its ad business — it could pull off something rare in streaming: profitable, diversified growth. The irony? For a company that famously shunned advertising for years, Netflix’s next act could be defined by it. If the company’s original story was about killing the cable bundle, the sequel might be about inheriting cable’s ad dollars. As the credits roll on the first chapter of the streaming wars, Netflix is already filming the next one. And this time, it comes with commercial breaks. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Circle’s Stock Rips by 175% on First Day of Trading Amid Flood of Interest in the Stablecoin Issuer’s IPO

Time Published: 2025-06-06T18:45:35Z

The shares of the stablecoin giant Circle surged on its first day as a public company. In a post on the social media platform X, the issuer of the second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC and the euro-pegged Euro Coin (EURC) says its shares can now be traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company initially announced plans to go public back in 2021. “Circle is now officially a public company, listed on the NYSE under CRCL. With USDC, EURC, Circle Payments Network & more, we’re pushing forward a future of frictionless value exchange. We are not just building financial products. We are building the money layer of the internet.” Circle made its stock market debut on Thursday with an opening price of $69 per share, up by 168.48% from the initial public offering (IPO) price of $31.00 per share. The company originally aimed for an IPO price of about $28 per share, but pseudonymous crypto analyst The Flow Horse says this is relatively low. “ I think $28 is going to look cheap over a multi-month period. Outside of the initial event volume, I will be looking for price to develop a clean range and ideally start to establish a longer-term position.” Circle’s stock peaked at $103.75 and closed at $83.23 on Thursday. Financial titan BlackRock reportedly plans to accumulate 10% of Circle’s shares. The world’s largest asset manager is already the acting reserve manager for the assets backing USDC.

Title: Replace your sunglasses with this rare deal on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses during this rare Amazon deal

If you’ve been wanting a pair of Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses, this is the best price I’ve seen since last year’s Black Friday. Amazon has pairs as low as $239 right now, both with and without tinted lenses. They offer the classic Wayfarer style, so they look good on just about everyone. The sale is limited to what’s in stock right now, so grab the color and the size you want before they sell out. With these discounts, they’re not that much more expensive than buying a new pair of sunglasses at the mall. Ray-Bans When talking about the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, most people focus on the built-in camera. It makes sense as it’s really cool to take hands-free photos and videos without help from a smartphone. However, I think people drastically underestimate the music playback feature. I don’t have a prescription, but I regularly wear a pair with clear lenses when I’m out shopping or just hanging out purely so I can listen to Spotify. The glasses beam the music straight into your ears, and there’s barely any sound leakage despite the lack of a physical earbud to plug up your ear canal. Meta AI offers some clever features as well. You can ask the virtual assistant to “look” at an object with a built-in camera and give you information about it. The glasses can also do real-time translations in several languages without the need to connect to the internet. The polarized lenses offer full sun protection and improve the overall clarity of everything you look at. There are several different colors and tints listed below, so grab the ones that fit your preference. If you have a large head, definitely make sure you order the large size. I wear a size 7 5/8 hat and bought the regular size, and wish I had gotten the larger model. They’re still cool and comfortable enough; they just look small on my face. It’s unlikely that you’re going to see these any cheaper than this until at least Black Friday this year, so grab a pair and use them all summer. Ray-Bans If you don’t need tint or a prescription, this model offers perfectly clear lenses so you can wear them all the time. I enjoy watching videos made by people who shop at thrift stores while wearing them. More deals, reviews, and buying guides Stan Horaczek is the executive gear editor at Popular Science.

Title: Circle’s victory: How USDC is rewriting the stablecoin playbook

Full Content:
Could USDC finally crack Tether’s fortress and rewrite the stablecoin playbook? The stablecoin market is heating up again. But this time, it’s not just another routine “flight-to-safety” shuffle. By launching its IPO on the NYSE, Circle plugged traditional finance straight into stablecoins, and the market didn’t hold back. USDC shot up 170%, closing at $84 from a $31 IPO price, pushing Circle’s valuation to $18 million. The timing is razor-sharp. With crypto volatility through the roof, stablecoins are the ultimate safe harbor. Sure, Tether [USDT] still wears the crown, but is Circle’s bold move sparking a liquidity shakeup? Circle’s IPO had an explosive first day, jumping from $31 to close at $82, a 171% gain and even hitting $93 intraday. The offering was 25 times over-subscribed, boosting Circle’s market value from $6.9 billion at open to around $17–20 billion. Source: Yahoo Finance But USDC still trails Tether in the stablecoin race. The reason? USDC currently has $60.3 billion in supply, roughly two-thirds the size of Tether. But Tether still dominates with $1 trillion in monthly volume making it significantly more profitable. Now, imagine if that flips. What if Tether’s hefty $153 billion supply suddenly struggles to attract liquidity as capital starts flowing elsewhere? That’s exactly the game Circle’s IPO is playing. According to AMBCrypto, it is aiming to rewrite the stablecoin rulebook. Circle’s NYSE debut wasn’t just about market cap. Instead, it pulled in some serious heavy hitters. Notably, big names like BlackRock and ARK jumped in, loading up on Circle shares and showing some serious confidence. Why does this matter? If buyers start stepping up, that $60.3 billion USDC supply could become a real advantage. Plus, Circle’s IPO is doing more than just raising cash, it’s helping stablecoins break into the traditional finance world for real. Source: TradingView (USDC.D) Meanwhile, Tether’s sitting on a mountain of supply that might just become a liability. So on the utility front, USDC is making moves, stepping up its game and challenging USDT’s long-held dominance. This is a strategic masterstroke led by Circle. If it takes off, the stablecoin market could face a major paradigm shift — one where USDC becomes the go-to liquidity magnet.

Title: Snowflake up its AI game, Circle IPO blasts off, and Elon splits with Trump
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/06/06/snowflake-ai-game-circle-ipo-blasts-off-elon-splits-trump/
Time Published: 2025-06-06T16:39:03Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 12:39 EDT / JUNE 06 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Snowflake made a big play this week at its annual Summit to own a larger swath of the artificial intelligence opportunity — still based on data but bringing in AI models, agents and other software to get stuff done. As Dave Vellante and George Gilbert put it in their Breaking Analysis deep dive, enterprise data platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks will be defined not by how well they store information but by how quickly they can convert data combined with business logic into automated actions. And in their latest Breaking Analysis, they drill down on Snowflake post-Summit to update their view of how it and other players are positioned. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy (pictured) made an impassioned pitch for Snowflake to lead that shift, but Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and a few others are knocking on that door too. And next week Databricks will get its turn at its Data+AI Summit to define how it’s going to play in that larger arena. In the least surprising development of late, Elon Musk’s bromance with Trump is apparently over, and he’s even backing the president’s impeachment as Tesla’s stock plunged 14% Thursday. But it escalated fast — popcorn time! Though Musk may soon back off. Assuming Musk still has enough cash, his xAI startup is going to spend $5 billion on new infrastructure. And the big spending to support AI continues, as Meta inked a 20-year deal to buy nuclear power and Amazon is spending $10 billion in North Carolina to expand its cloud infrastructure and advance AI. On the earnings front, AI momentum boosted Broadcom and HPE results, though investors split on them, and MongoDB saw its shares rise almost 13%. But it’s still a mixed bag given the uncertain economy and Trump’s daily shifts on tariffs. Amazon’s secretive Lab126 is now working on agentic AI, focused on robots. Autonomous robots? Hmm. Reddit sued Anthropic for scraping its data without permission. This issue isn’t going to die, but it’s anybody’s guess what impact it will have on, well, future models. Stablecoin provider Circle raised $1.1 billion in its IPO, and its shares jumped 168% on their first day of trading. We’ll see how stable its stock price is. Next up: Chime. And crypto exchange Gemini just filed confidentially to go public too. Next week there’s not only Databricks’ Data+AI Summit but Cisco Live, Apple’s WWDC and AWS re:Inforce. On the earnings front, Oracle’s the big one set to report, as well as Adobe, GitLab and SailPoint. Update: Silicon Valley lost two giants recently: Former longtime Hewlett-Packard CEO John Young on May 26, at age 93, and Bill Atkinson, a Macintosh pioneer and inventor of the web precursor Hypercard, on June 5, at age 74. They both represented some of the best in the Valley, unlike all too many current tech celebrities who seem more motivated by, well, fame and money. May they rest in peace up there with Bill, Dave and Steve. Here’s the most important enterprise and emerging tech news from SiliconANGLE and beyond: All the news, analysis and interviews from Snowflake Summit: Snowflake and Databricks cross the Rubicon into a new competitive domain Beyond walled gardens: How Snowflake navigates new competitive dynamics The next frontier in enterprise AI: What to watch at Snowflake and Databricks summits Snowflake platform enhancements focus on performance, governance and interoperability Snowflake expands AI tools to streamline enterprise data workflows and speed machine learning Snowflake buys Crunchy Data to add more bite to its AI agents Data engineering workloads evolve as Snowflake redefines its value stack: theCUBE keynote analysis Snowflake’s platform evolution spotlights metadata blind spots: theCUBE keynote analysis Snowflake and Meta team up to drive model innovation on Cortex AI Snowflake orchestrates its AI strategy through Cortex, unstructured data solutions and agents Exclusive: Unravel is giving away a Snowflake performance optimization analyzer RelationalAI introduces new graph processing features for its Snowflake app A few other observations and gleanings from my interviews with researchers and execs: * It goes without saying that Snowflake debuted a next-generation data warehouse that’s more than twice as fast, among many other features. One of the most interesting was Adaptive Compute, enabling users to avoid having to configure compute and other settings, and getting better performance as a result, especially for the kinds of quickly changing workloads such as AI.“ Adaptive will be the future,” Artin Avanes, head of Snowflake’s core data platform, told me (for now, it’s in private preview).. * But all that felt like almost an afterthought next to the new AI features and services, including Snowflake Intelligence (soon in public preview), which allows, say, a sales manager to ask, “What were my top product sales in the West region last quarter, and why did this product outperform that one?” and then even have AI agents take actions such as sending notifications. The service can tap a wide variety of data sources, from structured tables to Slack chats. * It’s one indication of how much higher Snowflake’s ambitions have become. As Dave Vellante and George Gilbert put it, enterprise data platforms will be defined not by how well they store information but by how quickly they can convert data combined with business logic into automated actions. “AI represents a new way of thinking about how different functions in a company operate,” Ramaswamy said in a press briefing. “We want to be the agent of transformation for our 10,000 customers. We want to be there with customers from the time data is there.” * The big focus this week was on unstructured data, and no wonder: Up to 90% of the world’s data is unstructured, that is, not in well-organized tables, and it needs to be gathered up and massaged so it can provide deeper analysis. I talked with LandingAI, which is partnering with Snowflake to apply what it calls agentic vision to unstructured data, in particular documents, whose formats can be downright quirky. “We’re kind of like Lasik for LLMs,” said CEO Dan Maloney.

In short, can it become a sort of operating system for AI agents? It’s not the only one trying. As Vellante asked in his analysis of the keynote: “Are they just basically data infrastructure that’s serving up agentic platforms or are they going to become the agentic platform?” * All this adds up to a democratization of data analysis beyond data scientists and business intelligence experts. Ultimately, Snowflake’s looking to make not only data analysis but applications most anyone can create — or maybe get an agent to do. “AI is a way to predict or use data to take actions based on it,” Dwarak Rajagopal, VP and head of AI engineering, told me. “Everybody could be a programmer.

[Click here for information about joining the class action] On May 15, 2025, the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “Meta Is Delaying the Rollout of Its Flagship AI Model.” Citing “people familiar with the matter”, the article reported, in relevant part, that “[c]ompany engineers are struggling to significantly improve the capabilities of its “Behemoth” large-language model, leading to staff questions about whether the improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release[.]” The article further reported that while originally “Behemoth was internally slated for an April release”, Meta subsequently “pushed an internal target for . . . Behemoth’s release to June” before “delay[ing] . . . to fall or later.” On this news, Meta’s stock price fell $19.02 per share, or 2.88%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $640.34 per share on May 16, 2025.

Title: Loblaws takes popular coffee brand off shelves after huge price increase
URL: https://dailyhive.com/toronto/loblaw-folgers-coffee-cost-increases
Time Published: 2025-06-06T15:34:27Z
Full Content:
Folgers will soon disappear from Loblaw store shelves after a pricing dispute between the grocer and the coffee brand. In an email to Daily Hive, a Loblaw spokesperson stated that Folgers recently proposed “significant” cost increases on its coffee, which it believes are “unreasonable and unjustified based on underlying costs.” “We know many Canadians have struggled with affordability in many aspects of their lives, and we have done what we can to keep prices down,” reads the statement. “An important part of this has always been pushing back on manufacturers when we believe proposed cost increases are unjustified.” Elena Berd/Shutterstock The spokesperson noted that the price hikes were not related to tariffs, but would have had tariffs applied on top if it. “Despite several attempts to address this with the manufacturer, we were not successful,” Loblaw stated. “We will not accept or pass unjustified cost increases on to customers, and therefore we have removed Folgers from our shelves.” The grocery giant added that it expects most stores to be out of stock over the next week or two, encouraging customers to check out its wide range of coffee brands available at competitive prices. The J.M. Smucker Company, manufacturer of Folgers coffee, told Daily Hive in an email statement that it continues to experience “record high and sustained green coffee prices.” The J.M. Smucker Company Loblaw’s April food inflation report highlighted that coffee is facing higher-than-usual prices due to a poor growing season. “To address this, we have leveraged our cost management strategy, which is inclusive of evaluating productivity and efficiency measures as well as pricing actions, only when necessary,” stated Smuckers. “Our pricing actions have been managed prudently and responsibly and have only been taken when justified by costs.” The American food company stated that it would continue to collaborate with all its retail partners to manage increased costs while delivering value to its shared customers. Sylvain Charlebois, director of the agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University, explained in a X post that the public nature of this dispute reminds him of the 2022 clash between Loblaw and PepsiCo Canada, which helped pave the way for a grocery code of conduct. “These disputes happen all the time—and they almost always end up costing consumers more,” wrote Charlebois. “Unwarranted fees and price hikes ripple up the food chain as suppliers try to offset the charges imposed by grocers.” Shoppers have been noticing the price hikes on Folgers coffee, sharing their frustrations online. “At Costco, Folgers increased from $18.49 to $27+. Absurd. No one will buy crappy coffee at that price,” reads one post on X. @CoryGavin/X In its latest food inflation report, Loblaw warned Canadians that grocery prices will continue to rise in Canada amid the trade war with the U.S.

Title: Meta Ray-Bans for 20% off is a great deal on one of my favorite products

If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form. Among the most popular tech products of the last year, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is currently offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of last year -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green-tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. ZDNET senior editor Sabrina Ortiz in her Meta Ray-Bans. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, in 2024, the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: I tested the best AR and MR glasses: Here's how the Meta Ray-Bans stack up If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a solid deal as well at $170 ($79 off) right now. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Based on the 20% savings on offer, ZDNET's rating system gives this a 3/5 Editor's deal rating. However, I've bumped it up to a 4/5, as this is in line with the price cut we saw on the glasses during Cyber Week, typically the biggest sale of the year. These glasses also rarely go on sale, making this an even more enticing offer. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings.

June 06, 2025 11:07 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Elevance and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 11, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The truth about this fraud was revealed through a series of disclosures culminating in February 2025 and March 2025. In February 2025, DoubleVerify reported disappointing earnings and disclosed a multiyear deceleration trend due to the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell 36 percent. Then, in March 2025, market research company Adalytics Research released a report claiming that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services are ineffective, and that DoubleVerify customers are regularly billed for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Title: Top researchers leave Intel to build startup with 'the biggest, baddest CPU'
URL: https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2025/06/top-researchers-leave-intel-to-build-startup-with-the-biggest-baddest-cpu.html
Time Published: 2025-06-06T14:07:28Z
Full Content:
AheadComputing CEO and co-founder Debbie Marr spent more than three decades at Intel, helping lead development of several generations of microprocessor. But she said her latest ideas required her to start fresh: "What we want to do has to be done outside of Intel. We want to move fast, we want to take a run at RISC-V."Mike Rogoway/The Oregonian Together, the four founders of Beaverton startup AheadComputing spent nearly a century at Intel. They were among Intel’s top chip architects, working years in advance to develop new generations of microprocessors to power the computers of the future. Now they’re on their own, flying without a net, building a new class of microprocessor on an entirely different architecture from Intel’s. Founded a year ago, AheadComputing is trying to prove there’s a better way to design computer chips. “AheadComputing is doing the biggest, baddest CPU in the world,” said Debbie Marr, the company’s CEO. A CPU is a central processing unit, the brain inside a computer. Intel has dominated the CPU market for decades, selling processors based on an architecture the chipmaker owns, called x86. Today, the computing ecosystem is fragmenting as new standards emerge. That’s one of the reasons Intel is struggling, as computing mainstays like Apple and Google use rival architectures to design their own chips for PCs, smartphones and data centers. AheadComputing is betting on an open architecture called RISC-V — RISC stands for “reduced instruction set computer.” The idea is to craft a streamlined microprocessor that works more efficiently by doing fewer things, and doing them better than conventional processors. For AheadComputing’s founders and 80 employees, many of them also Intel alumni, it’s a major break from the kind of work they’ve been doing all their careers. They’ve left a company with more than 100,000 workers to start a business with fewer than 100. “Every person in this room,” Marr said, looking across a conference table at her colleagues, “we could have stayed at Intel. We could have continued to do very exciting things at Intel.” They decided they had a better chance at leading a revolution in semiconductor technology at a startup than at a big, established company like Intel. And AheadComputing could be at the forefront of renewal in Oregon’s semiconductor ecosystem. “We see this opportunity, this light,” Marr said. “We took our chances.” Big players lose clout Intel has been operating in Oregon since the 1970s and has long been Oregon’s largest corporate employer. It has more than 20,000 employees in Washington County, including some of the world’s top semiconductor researchers. Very rarely, though, have any of those thousands of workers left to start their own chip business. That’s partly because it’s prohibitively expensive for a new company to build a semiconductor factory, and partly because Intel and other tech giants controlled the essential pieces around the CPU. It was hard for newcomers to break in. Today’s chip startups, however, don’t need their own factories. So-called fabless semiconductor designers like AheadComputing can outsource manufacturing to contractors like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The graphics and AI chip designer Nvidia has become a $3 trillion company — the world’s most valuable business — doing exactly that. And AheadComputing cofounder Jonathan Pearce says the reign of the chip titans is fading as the systems that run computers break up into a series of “chiplets” from various companies, optimized for specific tasks. “You get the opportunity for a company like AheadComputing to provide that piece of the overall system,” Pearce said. “As opposed to the past 20 years where it was just one tech giant.” RISC-V, pronounced “Risk-five,” is especially inviting to startups because it’s an open technology, overseen by a consortium of tech firms. Unlike processors based on x86 or ARM designs, there’s no licensing fee to use RISC-V. AheadComputing maintains that open standards are the future for microprocessors, giving technology companies more opportunity to customize chip designs to suit their specific needs. It will be years before AheadComputing’s designs are on the market, but it envisions its chips will someday power PCs, laptops and data centers. Possible clients could include Google, Amazon, Samsung or other large computing companies. Members of AheadComputing's executive team. From left to right: Mark Dechene (co-founder), Alon Mahl (vice president), Jonathan Pearce (co-founder), Srikanth Srinivasan (co-founder), Debbie Marr (co-founder, CEO)Mike Rogoway/The Oregonian That vision, and the pedigree of the Intel alumni leading the Beaverton startup, has attracted a lot of attention within the industry. AheadComputing raised $22 million in venture capital in February. Prominent semiconductor engineer Jim Keller — a superstar in the rarified field of chip architecture, with stints at Intel, AMD and Apple — turned heads when he joined AheadComputing’s board a month later. The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation as new chips emerge for artificial intelligence and chipmakers test the laws of physics with radical innovations like quantum computing. “This is where the future is. It’s not about x86. It’s not traditional computer architecture. That’s pretty much a dead field,” said Christof Teuscher, a Portland State University professor who teaches microprocessor design and computer architecture. AheadComputing is arriving at the right moment, Teuscher said, positioning itself to capitalize on upheaval in the industry — and the ongoing exodus of Intel employees. At this point, though, he said no one can know which new chip architectures will prevail. Traditionally, Teuscher said RISC-V has been used for embedded systems and academic research. He said he’s skeptical that it can prevail as the industry moves toward high-performance designs for artificial intelligence and supercomputing. “There’s high risk, but potentially high payoff,” Teuscher said. “And that’s definitely what I would describe their approach.” Silicon Forest’s new growth At Intel, AheadComputing’s founders were accustomed to working with cutting-edge manufacturing tools and enormous research labs. Now they’re doing everything themselves — setting up their Wi-Fi network, adding memory to desktop computers and ordering snacks and coffee for the break room. Alon Mahl left Intel to be AheadComputing’s vice president of design verification, a key role ensuring the company’s chips work as expected. But one of his first tasks was to find and lease an office. He picked a spot on the top floor of The Round development near downtown Beaverton. “That’s what’s exciting, is that you’re not doing only one thing. You’re doing everything,” Mahl said. “And each one is doing whatever he can to make this company a success. So that’s why I feel energized.” Intel provided the energy and innovation that fueled several generations of new chip technologies. It spent tens of billions to stay ahead of rivals, growing into Oregon’s largest corporate employer with more than 20,000 workers in Washington County. The cutting edge became increasingly tenuous, though, as the features on computer chips approached the atomic scale. Intel suffered a series of manufacturing setbacks, the result of bad bets on production technology and an utter failure to break into new sectors, like smartphones and artificial intelligence. Intel’s stumbles risk destabilizing Oregon’s semiconductor industry, one of the state’s economic pillars. The company shed 3,000 jobs last year, and more layoffs are expected in the coming weeks. There’s no replacing the outsized impact of Intel’s factories. But new players could help keep Oregon in the game as the semiconductor industry evolves. Ampere Computing, founded by former Intel President Renée James, sold to Japanese investment bank SoftBank in March for $6.5 billion. It’s retaining its offices in Portland’s Pearl District, where it designs chips used in data centers. Other Intel alumni have started a handful of other Oregon chip businesses in recent months. AheadComputing says it has already outgrown its offices at The Round and is looking for more space somewhere in Washington County. Big companies are designed to meet many corporate needs, in the same way conventional CPUs are built to handle all computing workloads. AheadComputing wants to be more like its processors, moving faster because it’s dedicated to specific tasks. “It’s very hard to disrupt an industry from inside,” said Mark Dechene, who spent 16 years as an Intel CPU architect before co-founding AheadComputing. At Intel, he said, researchers would consistently underestimate how long a project would take. He said AheadComputing’s engineers guess wrong about the timeframe, too, but now it’s because they’re moving much more quickly than they anticipated. “With a small, focused team of very capable people,” Dechene said, “you can get stuff done incredibly fast.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Posted on June 6, 2025 by Nick Roach 7 Comments The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you’ll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 16. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven’t tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn’t publish a post for Public Alpha 15, so I’ll cover everything that has changed since then. We implemented 84 bug fixes and improvements, three new features, including Attribute Management, Settings Search and Filtering, and Extend Attributes, and made significant progress on four upcoming features. Regarding bug fixes, we have been focusing heavily on backward compatibility as we gear up for the Divi 5 Public Beta. We’re moving full speed ahead with feature development. We have seven teams working full-time on Divi 5. Here is what they’re up to. 👇 We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 16. 🎉 Extend Attributes is like a design superpower, taking Divi 4’s Extend Styles features to the next level. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 15.1. 🎉 Settings Search and Filtering allows you to search and filter the Divi 5 settings panel, making working with Divi’s vast array of design options much easier. You may be familiar with this feature in Divi 4, and due to popular demand, we brought it to Divi 5 and made it even better. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 14.1. 🎉 Attribute Management empowers you to selectively or collectively copy, paste, and reset attributes across elements. It’s the most comprehensive attribute system for any builder! 🤩 Give it a try today! We gave a sneak peek at Loop Builder a couple of weeks ago, and the feature is already 60% complete. The idea behind Divi’s loop builder is simple: loop anything! You can create new post-based content by looping sections, rows, columns, groups, modules, and sub-elements. We gave a sneak peek of Relative Colors a few weeks ago, and the feature is already 80% complete. Get ready for a feature announcement soon! You can create true relative color systems based on color variables with Relative Colors. No other page builder has this color variable/HSL integration, and I think you will love it. Flexbox Layouts and Controls is a massive feature, but development is progressing faster than anticipated. This feature is nearly 90% complete, and you shouldn’t have to wait much longer before it’s live. Flexbox layouts will have great synergy with Module Groups and Nested Rows. Divi 5’s layout system is about to reach its final form! This feature got a rough start, but the team has hit its stride. We plan to finish our first big batch of modules in a couple of weeks, including all product modules, accounting for most of Divi’s WooCommerce modules. That will set us up nicely for a mid-year Divi 5 Beta launch, with plenty of time to release the official version this year. Here is a list of all the changes implemented in Public Alpha 16. It’s important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features, but what’s done is ready to be used. It’s far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. If an existing website depends on a feature that hasn’t been added to Divi 5, you should continue using Divi 4. WooCommerce modules are the only things missing. Even then, Divi 4’s legacy WooCommerce modules will still work in Divi 5 in backward compatibility mode. We aim to enter beta within ~3 months based on our progress. There are three things we want to accomplish before entering the beta phase, and half of our team is focused on these tasks: Divi 5 will reach its “final form” before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don’t forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we’re maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we’re confident in removing that choice, we’ll make it “official,” and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today. Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you find a bug, report it to our team, and we’ll fix it. We’ll continue to work aggressively to add new features and address feedback. Stay tuned for a new Divi 5 version every two weeks. Browse hundreds of modules and thousands of layouts. Learn about the new way to manage your Divi assets.

June 06, 2025 08:46 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

June 06, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global deferiprone market was valued at US$ 39.89 million in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 55.22 million by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 3.68% during the forecast period 2025–2033. Clinicians confronted with transfusion-dependent thalassemia major, sickle cell disease, myelodysplastic syndromes, and rare inherited anemias increasingly rely on iron chelation to prevent cardiomyopathy and hepatic failure. Against this backdrop, the Deferiprone market has become an indispensable component of comprehensive hematology care. The World Health Organization records roughly 63,000 births each year with homozygous β-thalassemia, while global registries list more than 300,000 newborns with sickle cell disease annually. Each patient can accumulate up to 0.3 grams of iron from a single red-cell transfusion, and many receive at least 20 transfusions per year, creating an urgent clinical mandate for efficient, orally available chelators. Download Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/deferiprone-market Deferiprone, introduced three decades ago and now available in tablet, oral solution, and extended-release forms, remains the only bidentate chelator capable of accessing intracellular labile iron pools. Consequently, cardiologists report a tangible decline in transfusion-related cardiac deaths wherever routine chelation includes this agent. Recent meta-analyses covering 8,700 patient-years demonstrate a mean reduction of 5.6 micrograms per gram dry weight in hepatic iron when Deferiprone is combined with standard therapy, underscoring its synergistic potential. These hard clinical outcomes, rather than promotional narratives, underpin sustained growth of the market. Key Findings in Deferiprone Market Incidence Data Highlights Unmet Needs Fueling Ongoing Clinical Demand Worldwide Drilling deeper into epidemiology exposes the granular patient pools that continually replenish the Deferiprone market. India’s national thalassemia registry listed 99,258 transfusion-dependent individuals by February 2024, an increase of 4 600 cases over the preceding two years. China’s southern provinces collectively treat about 88,000 comparable patients, according to Guangdong’s Center for Genetic Blood Disorders. Meanwhile, the Eastern Mediterranean region follows closely with approximately 40,000 clinically significant cases managed across Egypt, Iran, and Greece. Because each thalassemic child consumes nearly 18 units of packed red cells annually, hematology day-care centers in these geographies order chelators at volumes previously seen only in tertiary Western hospitals. Parallel demand drivers emerge from sickle cell cohorts. Nigeria hosts an estimated 150,000 children living with severe sickle cell complications that necessitate regular exchange transfusion protocols; Democratic Republic of Congo manages close to 90 000 comparable cases. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documents roughly 100,000 affected individuals, about 6 000 of whom are on chronic transfusion programs. Each exchange procedure introduces between 200 and 300 milligrams of additional iron, rapidly surpassing physiologic clearance thresholds. Without prompt chelation, organ damage progresses within five years of therapy initiation. This confluence of sizeable, transfusion-dependent populations sustains robust throughput across the Deferiprone market. Regulatory Milestones And Label Expansions Influence Competitive Positioning Dynamics Globally Regulators have steadily broadened clinical indications, materially altering how stakeholders appraise the Deferiprone market. The US Food and Drug Administration granted the molecule’s first domestic approval in October 2011 for transfusional iron overload in thalassemia major, followed by an adolescent label extension in 2015. A further update in July 2022 introduced sickle cell disease and other chronic anemias to the prescribing information, effectively doubling the addressable patient pool. Europe mirrored this trajectory; the European Medicines Agency endorsed pediatric use down to six years in 2021, while Italy’s AIFA added compassionate reimbursement for myelodysplastic syndromes in 2023 based on real-world registry data involving 312 adults. In parallel, authorities in Japan (May 2021) and South Korea (January 2024) issued marketing licenses after local bridging studies confirmed comparable pharmacokinetics to Ferriprox. China’s National Medical Products Administration accepted Anhui Golden Sun’s abbreviated dossier in March 2024, paving the way for the country’s first domestic generic launch in early 2025. Each regulatory green light not only widens clinical access but also recalibrates competitive strategy, particularly for originator holder Chiesi Global Rare Diseases. As time-bound exclusivities expire, dossier approvals in emergent jurisdictions intensify price competition yet expand overall prescription volume, a dynamic that keeps the Deferiprone market fluid and opportunity-rich. Technological Innovations Elevate Formulation Convenience And Patient Adherence Metrics Substantially Product engineering advances now concentrate on reducing pill burden and mitigating gastrointestinal intolerance—two chief reasons patients abandon chelation, a persistent pain point for the Deferiprone market worldwide. A landmark 2023 study in Haematologica detailed how a once-daily 1,500 mg modified-release matrix reduced reported nausea episodes by 35 per thousand dosing days when compared with three-times-daily immediate-release tablets. The formulation, co-developed by Chiesi and Skyepharma, maintains serum trough concentrations above the 20 µmol/L threshold for eight continuous hours. Such pharmacokinetic smoothing aligns with contemporary adherence-support paradigms, and its commercial roll-out is already reshaping hospital formularies within the Deferiprone market. Parallel innovation is unfolding in digital therapeutics. Bluetooth-enabled smart bottle caps paired with HIPAA-compliant mobile applications now log real-time dosing events, transmit adherence alerts to clinicians, and integrate ferritin laboratory values imported from electronic health records. In a Cleveland Clinic pilot released April 2024, median adherence across 78 patients improved from 61 to 82 missed doses per year after deployment of the connected packaging. By fusing patient engagement technology with improved pharmacology, stakeholders are addressing both sides of the persistence equation. These synergistic advances enhance measurable outcomes and create differentiated value propositions inside the Deferiprone market. Regional Disparities Reveal Access Barriers And Emerging Distribution Partnerships Initiatives The geographical distribution of chelation therapy remains uneven, creating stark contrasts in treatment standards. Only 14 of Africa’s 54 countries list deferiprone on national essential medicine schedules, and fewer than 25 tertiary centers on the continent possess consistent drug supply. Freight cost spikes—averaging 1,200 US dollars per pallet in 2023—contribute to recurrent shortages. To bridge the gap, the humanitarian consortium Global Blood Initiative entered a five-year memorandum with Chiesi in November 2023, committing 1.2 million tablet equivalents annually for donation to Uganda, Tanzania, and Ghana. Such public-private ventures broaden humanitarian visibility but capture only a fraction of pent-up demand within the Deferiprone market. Conversely, Latin America is charting collaborative distribution models that leverage regional manufacturing. Argentina’s Akron Pharma began local blister production under license in late 2022, trimming delivery lead times from 90 to 28 days and reducing import duties. Brazil’s Ministry of Health followed with a technology-transfer agreement, aiming to reach 12 state oncology centers by mid-2024. These initiatives dovetail with Pan-American Health Organization procurement platforms, boosting negotiating power and ensuring continuous stock. Successful replication of such frameworks across additional low-resource settings could dramatically level access inequities and unlock dormant segments of the Deferiprone market. Competitive Landscape Intensifies As Generics Challenge Established Brand Positioning Globally Chiesi’s Ferriprox still holds leadership status, yet 2023 marked the arrival of formidable generic contenders that are recalibrating cost dynamics. Teva’s USP-validated tablets gained final FDA approval in December 2023, followed by Hikma’s submission acceptance in the European Union during February 2024. In India, where reverse-engineering prowess is well entrenched, at least seven Drug Controller General-approved brands—including Cipla’s Sifinox and Natco’s Ferinol—vie for hospital tenders. Wholesale acquisition costs now vary by up to 19 US dollars per gram across jurisdictions, underscoring widening price dispersion. This intensifying rivalry adds fresh complexity but also broadens affordability within the Deferiprone market. The originator is countering with value-added services rather than aggressive discounting. An expanded Ferriprox Total Care program launched in April 2024 bundles genetic counseling, adherence coaching, and free absolute neutrophil count monitoring for eligible US patients. In Europe, Chiesi is piloting an outcomes-based reimbursement contract with the National Health Service that ties payment tranches to serial ferritin and T2* cardiac MRI improvements. Meanwhile, smaller specialty firms are targeting niche subpopulations such as pyruvate kinase deficiency, hoping to differentiate beyond price. The collective result is a vibrant, multifactorial contest that keeps strategic stakes high across every layer of the Deferiprone market. Pipeline Exploration Broadens Therapeutic Horizons Beyond Hematology Core Applications Frontier Academic consortia have begun exploiting deferiprone’s metal chelation profile to modulate neurodegenerative pathways characterized by aberrant iron deposition. The University of Melbourne’s FAIR-PARK II trial enrolled 372 early-stage Parkinson’s patients and reported in 2023 that twice-daily 30 mg/kg dosing slowed Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor score progression by 3.2 points over two years. Similarly, the Italian TIRCON network is running a 120-patient phase III study in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, with interim analyses expected Q4 2024. Positive readouts could create fresh regulatory submissions and extend the Deferiprone market well beyond hematology clinics. Other exploratory fronts include a 60-patient US National Eye Institute protocol investigating retinal iron overload in age-related macular degeneration, and a multicenter French study assessing intravenous deferiprone for acute mucormycosis adjunctive therapy. While these indications are still nascent, they illustrate the molecule’s mechanistic versatility and the appetite for repositioning small-molecule chelators. Investors tracking orphan-neurology spaces are already modeling incremental revenue accretion scenarios, contingent on phase III success. Should even one of these programs translate into approval, the Deferiprone market will witness a meaningful broadening of prescriber base, reinforcing long-term growth prospects. Request Report Customization: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/deferiprone-market Future Outlook Balances Opportunities Against Pricing And Safety Constraints Ahead Looking toward 2033, stakeholders likely to anticipate that cumulative clinical evidence, label expansions, and digital adherence innovations will keep patient uptake on an upward trajectory. Annual global blood transfusion volumes surpassed 120 million units in 2024, and each incremental liter of packed cells revalidates the clinical rationale for chelation. Policy momentum is equally supportive; the World Bank’s new Global Sickle Cell Strategy allocates 700 million US dollars over the next five years to holistic care packages that explicitly list oral iron chelators. These macro-level events establish a sturdy demand floor for the Deferiprone market. Nonetheless, certain headwinds deserve equal scrutiny. Neutropenia rates of 1.7 cases per thousand patient-months, documented in the 2024 Deferiprone Safety Consortium registry (n = 12 456), demand continued pharmacovigilance and proactive monitoring infrastructure. On the economics side, payer pressure is escalating; Germany’s G-BA has initiated a benefit-assessment reassessment post generic entry, and India’s National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority is reviewing ceiling prices for chelation agents in 2025. These converging forces will oblige manufacturers to refine risk-management programs and optimize supply-chain efficiencies. Successfully navigating such constraints will delineate tomorrow’s winners within the Deferiprone market.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have soared this year, fuelled by a combination of U.S. president Donald Trump’s support and Wall Street adoption (with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk making a dramatic return to the front lines of crypto this week). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price, after rebounding sharply from its April lows, has held above $100,000 per bitcoin since early May even after BlackRock issued a serious bitcoin warning. Now, as fears swirl of a “cataclysmic” U.S. dollar collapse, Jim Esposito, the president of market maker Citadel Securities, has warned the spiraling $37 trillion U.S. debt pile is a “ticking time bomb”—adding to similar warnings that some think could be about to send the bitcoin price sharply higher. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is grappling with a $37 trillion debt "ticking time bomb" as ... More Wall Street's embrace of crypto pushes up the bitcoin price. “The stock of debt and the budget deficit is a ticking time bomb,” Esposito said at the Piper Sandler Global Exchange & Trading Conference in comments reported by Reuters. “No one is smart enough to predict when exactly it will rear its ugly head. We’ve been talking about this for more than 20 years, so in some ways the market’s gone into complacency, but over a multi-year period we can work this out.” Esposito added that Citadel Securities, a Wall Street market-making giant that was founded by hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, plans to ramp up its bitcoin and crypto trading this year in anticipation of a new crypto regulatory framework. "Crypto is definitely a space we’re going to get bigger in, and we're excited about the prospects," Esposito added. The worsening U.S. debt crisis, which has dramatically blown up the relationship between Elon Musk and president Trump this week, was exacerbated by massive government spending through Covid lockdowns. The rise in U.S. debt comes as the Federal Reserve, led by chair Jerome Powell, holds the line on interest rates despite pressure from Trump and the bond market suffers highly volatile swings that are a sign of waning faith in the U.S. from investors. Economic and monetary uncertainty has pushed some traders and companies toward bitcoin, leading to a flood of bullish bitcoin price predictions.

More spiraling U.S. debt pile. “The dominant story for bitcoin has changed again,” Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick wrote in an emailed note. “It was correlation to risk assets ... It then became a way to position for strategic asset reallocation out of U.S. assets.” Kendrick has predicted the bitcoin price will soar to $500,000 per bitcoin by the end of Trump’s presidency in early 2029 as a result of his U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve and the ending of stifling regulations that will see more companies buy bitcoin. “Institutions are reinforcing their exposure to bitcoin, building out their bitcoin treasuries,” Seamus Rocca, the chief executive of bitcoin and crypto custody company Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments. "Whether you’re looking at institutional flows or retail behavior, the message is the same: conviction in bitcoin’s long-term value is holding firm–and growing.”

Any society needs a monetary system to advance beyond the most primitive level. The trouble arises when the system is taken over by the most selfish and ruthless elements who use it for their own self-aggrandizement to the detriment of everyone else in the community. This is what has happened in the nations of the Collective West. The primary mechanism of control is creation of a banking system based on usury—i.e., charging interest on loans. This fee for the privilege of taking part in the economic life of society is in fact an indirect tax that goes to support a financial aristocracy that ends up controlling all trade, politics, and even culture. A façade of “democracy” and “self-government” may be maintained for appearances’ sake, but this is really a mechanism to engender the “war of each against all” so people won’t notice they are being controlled and manipulated. In today’s world, a revolt against this system is gathering steam, led by “civilizational states” like Russia, China, Iran, India, and others—all states the Collective West defines as “threats.” The financial elites quickly move to destroy any movement toward monetary reform, even as they tolerate or even encourage other types of relatively harmless protest, including “elections,” as well as self-destructive activities like drugs, sexual degeneracy, etc. The last US protest against the financial system was the “Occupy Wall Street” movement that was quickly suppressed. Nevertheless, the core of a monetary reform movement has remained and continues to attract notice. Among these has been the “End the Fed” campaign of people like Ron Paul and Thomas Massey, but also a much more sophisticated group that has its roots in the activities of the American Monetary Institute, the Public Banking Institute, the Direct Funding movement, etc. A notable component of this effort was the NEED Act of 2011 entered onto the ledger of Congress by Dennis Kucinich, adopted as part of the platform of the Green Party, and still on the books. Today, we present a major proposal for direct action by one of the leaders of the Green Party, Howard Switzer from his Substack, “Howard’s Newsletter.” Howard is an architect promoting earth-friendly construction and sovereign monetary reform. He is a founding member and former co-chair of the Green Party of Tennessee and served many terms on the Green Party’s National Committee as a delegate from Tennessee while running for office in Tennessee three times. In 2017 he led a successful defense of the “Greening the Dollar” plank in the Green Party Platform against an effort by outside advocates of “Modern Monetary Theory” to remove it. He is also a founding board member and former president of the Alliance for Just Money, and he is a co-founder and a current co-chair of the GPUS Banking and Monetary Reform Committee (BMRC). —Richard C. Cook, June 5, 2025 *** By Howard Switzer, June 3, 2025 I have been reading numerous essays exposing and describing the enormous, catastrophic, horrific and unbelievably profitable crimes of the System, the capitalist monetary system. It is the mechanism of power in the private hands of the Monsters of Mammon, the apparent psychopaths who control the allocation of global capital, the money, thus “everything,” as Henry Kissinger famously noted. Most of those essays do not have a hint of what to do about it. The cynical use of the axioms “if it bleeds it leads” or “If it burns it earns” by the Monster’s mass media are used because they know that humans have a negativity bias that attracts our attention while positive stories do not. Those stories then get highlighted and repeated by numerous essay writers whose attention was captured. This constant assault impacts our mental and physical health. Research has shown that people can exhibit increased depression and anxiety symptoms after only 14 minutes of news consumption. Negative headlines seriously play on our emotions too, which is why they push engagement so powerfully. “A recent Stanford University study reported, for example, that emotional stories are around 22 times more memorable than facts alone.”[1] This increased stress is a major factor in illnesses. To protect our health, we are told to reduce our exposure. Negativity bias is related to our fight-or-flight response but the ‘recommendation for protecting our health’ seems to be flight rather than fight. Considering our predicament flight does not seem to be a viable option, for where can we go to escape this gargantuan monster’s global grip? Further, this serves the Monster’s agenda by keeping the people distracted by the symptoms of the disease, so they don’t see the disease itself. Those who write about solutions are ignored in favor of those who write only about the seemingly intractable problems. The constant exposure to pain and fear makes us susceptible to neuroticism. “Compellingly, out-group animosity (denigrating one’s political opponents online) appears to be a stronger motivation to vote than in-group amity (friendliness). Thus, there appears to be political capital in encouraging online hate by one’s supporters. A 2018 study, for example, studied two populist rhetoric driven campaigns: Donald Trump’s 2016 US presidential campaign and the UK Brexit referendum from the same year. Researchers reported that both campaigns heavily appealed to similar pain points—fear, for example, as well as lost national pride, overplayed immigration fears, baiting opposing voter groups, and racism, or the fear of other nationalities or ethnicities. These negative headlines powerfully drove exposure and engagement.”[1] All this indicates that to attract attention to fighting this we need to generate animosity for the Monsters of Mammon. However directing it at humans, no matter how awful they are, seems counter to the world’s need for greater empathy and care to reduce dangerous and destructive fear, replacing it with love, the other root emotion. Thus, I think we need to focus our hatred and animosity on the System, the capitalist monetary system, which is the illegitimate mechanism of power, a usurpation of power with the sin of usury. A power that rightfully belongs to us all, not a greedy, and one can only assume a psychologically damaged, few. Usury does have serious psychological consequences. It seems like we need to understand how the System operates then organize and express our hatred for what it does. The issues facing civil society seem to get bigger and more urgent with every election cycle and polls show that the number one issue for most of the electorate, regardless of political affiliation, regardless of which party is in power, is the economy. What about the economy that makes it an issue? The answer unequivocally is money. People don’t have enough money to pay for the things they and their family need to maintain a decent quality of life; food, shelter, transportation, healthcare and enough money to pay their debts so as not to default on their loans and lose what they have. People are not concerned about inflation if they have enough money. No solution to the problem of poverty has ever been so effective as providing income to the poor, income is by far the best antidote for deprivation. An economy in depression is an economy with not enough money in circulation, a policy of austerity only makes it worse. The truth is that nothing denies a person liberty more than the absence of money and no truth has ever spawned more ingenious evasion than that. If the lack of money is the problem, then a political party that wants to win must offer a viable solution to that problem. Why is it that 80% of the population is struggling for lack of money? Over 60% could not cover a $400 emergency. People can see that the economy is not designed to serve most people. “The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer” is an aphorism that has been popularly repeated since long before the civil war. We have an economic system that steadily transfers wealth to the super-rich. People have felt powerless as their government bails out the big banks and spends trillions on corporate subsidies and foreign wars. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this process as 8 million more Americans slid into poverty, 100 million world-around, and100,000 small businesses, responsible for creating two out of every three new jobs in the U.S. economy, closed their doors permanently. At the same time the world’s billionaires increased their wealth to a record $10.2 trillion, and that is just the amount they admit to. This is where we are, what some call “late-stage capitalism” is an unleashed neoliberal crime fest as private equity firms pillage any company that has value now even targeting retirement savings and healthcare. They are coming for our homes too. The result is increased economic suffering, homelessness, and increasing oppression to keep it going that way. Our elections and public policy are controlled by money. All the regulatory agencies are captured by the industries they are supposed to regulate, and the military industrial complex takes the lion’s share of discretionary spending year after year as interest payments on the federal debt blow past a trillion dollars per year. These are the reasons that trust in the two major political parties and our national institutions has fallen to a record low. There have been calls for a new political party to pick up the pieces and champion the American people. A party that can effectively tie economic justice to monetary reform can galvanize 80% of the population, farmers, working-class and small business Americans, to challenge elite power and present a credible alternative to establishment politics. The Green Party has the platform and infrastructure to be that party. What it lacks is vision. Can there be any doubt that money rules the roost? That being the case it behooves us to look at the money system we have since it is not taught in any of our schools and has long been kept shrouded in mystery. It is our nation’s privatized monetary system that creates and allocates the money. There have been numerous calls for monetary reform over the last 240 years, but most people are unaware of them as the systemic solution has always been drowned out by constant debates over polarizing issues. The System is a system of usury; the abuse of monetary authority for personal gain which has been described as an extraordinarily efficient form of violence by which one can do the most damage with the least amount of effort. We call this System capitalism. Capitalism = (capital = money) + (ism = system) = money system. The central feature and source of the awesome power of the Monsters of Mammon is the debt-based private global monetary system they own and operate through the global banking system. Capitalism is often wrongly conflated with “free enterprise” and “free markets” but capitalism ensures that these are NOT free. This is because capitalism is a debt parasite on the back of free enterprise making every household, business and government in this world in debt and dependent on the banking System. The System issues all money as interest-bearing debt in the process of making loans. That may sound relatively benign because it has been normalized, but it is a form of slavery that systematically concentrates wealth to the wealthiest, the Monsters of Mammon. Credit, used for money, is created by the banking system as the principal of a loan and, because that is the way money is created, the interest on that loan must be paid from money created by another’s loan. This drives destructive growth and predatory competition as people compete to pay the interest on their debts, so they won’t default on their loan and lose their real wealth collateral. The System is not stable because when loan payments (money destroyed) exceed loans being made (money created) the System crashes for lack of money creating a recession or depression depending on the amounts and how many loans default. This causes a massive transfer of wealth because when this happens the real-wealth collateral is picked up for pennies on the dollar by those with the money. Furthermore, interest is compounded (interest on interest) throughout the System’s economy which is built into the prices of all the goods and services we buy, on average 50%. This means money going to the Monsters of Mammon with every transaction. “All wars are bankers wars” To be clear by bankers I mean their shareholders, the Monsters of Mannon, who demand a constant flow of profits. The System has for over 500 years, forced sovereign governments to turn over their sovereignty, their monetary authority, to the bankers due to war debt. The word capitalism comes from the French word, “capitalisme,” which refers to the system of war finance, or the practice of borrowing large amounts of money to fund the costs of war. War debt is how the Monsters of Mammon got nations to hand over their monetary authority to the wealthy private interests. who controlled large accumulations of money. You can tell those who are resistant by looking at the System’s list of enemies, the smaller of which have been or are being destroyed by war. The larger enemies are continually being threatened with war. The System allows control of every industry in the world by the Monsters of Mannon. It dominates the ownership of raw materials, the means of production, exploits earth’s materials and labor, concentrates wealth, creates poverty, drives destructive growth, predatory competition and all wars. The System has made the U.S. Dollar the international reserve currency and abuses its currency dominance using sanctions and war to gain control over resources it wants to exploit. The System is a system of debt slavery: student loans, medical debt, and credit card exploitation trap millions. The System causes inflation. Issuing money as debt is itself inflationary, but banks can increase inflation at will which is used as a weapon for controlling economies or bring them to their knees. Every instance of hyperinflation you’ve heard of was caused by banks making war upon a nation’s economy. The governments blamed for hyperinflation were the targets and have long served as the whipping boy for the crimes of the Monsters of Mammon. The System allows the massive accumulation of money making it an instrument of power with which to control, industry, governments, economies, in short, as Henry Kissinger said, “…if you control the money, you can control everything.” The banking oligopoly, a handful of megabanks like JPMorgan, CITI Bank, Bank of America, etc., control most of the lending and are all owned, along with all the major corporations and their subsidiaries, by the largest asset managers in the world, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, behind which the Monsters of Mammon hide and shield themselves from liability and accountability. The System uses technology as a weapon but sells to us as a convenience, thus they profit from selling the very tools they use as a weapon to subjugate us and the world. Digital surveillance, private fintech, cryptocurrency and AI all threaten financial freedom and are employed by the Monsters of Mammon to make war upon the world. This list could go on getting into more detail but that should be enough to make you realize the scale of what we are up against. To fight it we must summon forth the courage that David did to fight Goliath. Like David’s slingshot our weapon may seem too small and impotent for the job and yet it got the job done with miraculous efficiency. Our weapon is Monetary Reform, a term that people may find mundane and are unfamiliar with because it is not taught in schools; the System does not allow the monetary system to be a legitimate field of inquiry. Economists, to protect their careers, shun knowledge of it. Economics studies wealth while ignoring power and Political Science studies power while ignoring wealth. This is what makes these fields so mind-numbingly boring. However, Political Economy, the study of the relationship between wealth and power, makes both relevant and exciting.

Title: How High Can Netflix Stock Climb? It’s Just Getting Started

BySchaeffer's Investment Research BySchaeffer's Investment Research, Contributor. Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) has built a 3.5% lead this week alone, thanks to price-target hikes from UBS to $1,450 on Wednesday, and from Jefferies to $1,400 on Tuesday. Out of the gate on Thursday, the shares hit a record high of $1,262.81, bringing its year-to-date tally up to 40%. If you missed the train on this frenetic rally, never fear, because the stock is flashing a historically bullish signal on the charts. NFLX’s new high comes amid historically low implied volatility (IV) -- a combination that has been bullish for the stock in the past. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been seven other instances in the past five years when the stock was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th annual percentile or lower -- as is the case with the equity's current SVI of 25%, in the 4th percentile of its 12-month range. The data shows that one month after those seven previous signals, Netflix stock was up 7.1%, on average and finished the month higher 86% of the time. From its current perch at $1,248.37, another move of that magnitude would put the equity above $1,300. Per the chart below, this would take NFLX past an ascending trendline starting from its December highs. Also note the double bottom pattern that could signal this rally has legs, and the upward-sloping 20-day moving average containing short-term pullbacks. Netflix stock chart Even with the bull notes this week, Netflix’s consensus 12-month price target of $1,167.35 is a 6.5% discount to its current perch. If analysts continue to adjust to Netflix’s chart dominance, those price-target hikes will keep the wind at the security’s back. Short-term options traders are heavily put-skewed right now. NFLX’s Schaeffer’s put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) comes in at 1.50, and sits in the 100th percentile of its annual range, showing such a preference for short-term puts is rare in the last 12 months. An unwinding of these bearish bets in the options pits is one final contrarian angle that could keep the momentum going.

Title: FCA clears path for UK retail crypto ETF trading—kind of

FCA aims to strike balance between market growth and consumer protection with crypto ETN access. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has proposed lifting its longstanding ban on crypto exchange-traded notes for retail investors, opening the door for broader access to regulated crypto exposure through public investment exchanges. The move, announced June 6, forms part of a broader regulatory push to bolster market competitiveness and reduce barriers for financial firms. Retail investors would be allowed to purchase crypto ETNs, debt instruments tied to digital asset prices, if these are listed on a recognized investment exchange and meet the UK’s financial promotion rules. The FCA emphasized that safeguards would still apply, including requirements for risk disclosures and restrictions on promotional incentives, similar to the rules for direct digital asset sales. The FCA’s proposal does not extend to spot crypto ETFs like in the US through BlackRock and the Newborn Nine. ETNs (Exchange-Traded Notes) are unsecured debt securities that track the price of a digital asset but do not hold the underlying asset. The FCA proposes allowing retail access to these as long as they’re listed on recognized investment exchanges and meet financial promotion rules. Spot ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), which directly hold crypto (e.g., Bitcoin) as the underlying asset, are not currently permitted in the UK and remain subject to broader regulatory and legislative constraints. The FCA has not proposed changes here. So, this consultation does not pave the way for spot ETFs in the UK. Any move in that direction would likely require new rules around custody, fund structures, and potentially legislative change. For now, ETNs are the FCA’s chosen compromise vehicle for retail exposure under tight oversight. Charlie Morris from crypto ETF issuer ByteTree celebrated the news, stating, “I am thrilled by the recent announcement that the FCA has lifted the ban on UK retail investors trading in crypto ETFs.” [Editor’s Note: In Europe, many issuers (ByteTree included) market their physically-backed crypto products as “ETFs”, even though the legal wrapper is an ETP/ETN/ETC. ByteTree’s blog explicitly lumps the terms together, describing “Bitcoin ETFs (also referred to as ETPs, ETNs, ETCs)” when discussing London listings. Their tweet is therefore branding rather than a statement of new ETF permissions.] What will change if the proposal is adopted? Retail clients could buy the same sterling-denominated crypto ETNs that professional investors already trade on the London Stock Exchange, such as 21Shares, WisdomTree, or Invesco products (including ByteTree’s BOLD bitcoin-and-gold ETN). The trading experience will look like an ETF, with a ticker on an exchange and intraday liquidity. Still, the instrument will remain a note, with counterparty risk to the issuer and no direct title to the underlying coins. The consultation reverses the FCA’s 2021 policy of barring retail access to crypto ETNs and derivatives. While the retail ban on crypto derivatives will remain in force, the regulator’s latest stance reflects its evolving posture on high-risk investments and its intention to grant consumers greater autonomy in choosing investment products. According to FCA executive director David Geale, the shift represents an effort to “rebalance” the regulator’s risk framework, allowing retail participants to decide whether such investments align with their risk tolerance. The change follows a March 2024 update in which the FCA said it would not object to UK exchanges launching dedicated market segments for crypto ETNs aimed at professional investors. The new proposal would extend this access to retail customers, provided the products are listed on an FCA-recognized venue, such as the London Stock Exchange, and comply with investor protection mandates. The announcement appears alongside the FCA’s broader quarterly consultation, which includes measures to simplify reporting obligations for asset managers and reduce unnecessary data collection across regulated firms. While those measures aim to ease compliance burdens for traditional financial services, the crypto ETN proposal aligns more directly with the UK Treasury’s ambition to position the country as a global hub for digital asset innovation. Per the FCA’s crypto roadmap published in late 2024, the UK is implementing a phased regulatory regime covering stablecoins, custodial requirements, market abuse prevention, and prudential standards for crypto firms. Parallel consultations are underway on stablecoin issuance and digital asset custody, while a May 2025 discussion paper outlined proposals for licensing and oversight of broader crypto activities. The proposed change would bring the UK closer to the regulatory stance adopted by the European Union, where crypto ETNs are widely available to retail investors across exchanges like Deutsche Börse’s Xetra platform and Euronext. Over 300 crypto-linked ETNs are currently listed on Xetra, and issuers such as 21Shares and VanEck have broadened their offerings to include assets like Solana and PYTH. In contrast, the US has prioritized spot-based Bitcoin ETFs over the ETN structure, with crypto ETNs remaining largely absent from public markets there. The consultation remains open through July 31. If approved, the change would grant UK-based investors access to crypto ETNs under regulated conditions, a shift expected to reshape retail participation channels without overturning the FCA’s prohibition on derivatives. By distinguishing between the two instruments, the FCA appears to be signaling a more nuanced approach to crypto regulation, one that attempts to balance market growth with consumer protection within existing legal frameworks.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider cryptocurrency market recovered from overnight lows, with monero (XMR), XRP and SUI leading the bounce ahead of the pivotal U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show a slowdown in hiring in May. "In the short term, weak data may support BTC to continue the rebound. The market is concerned about Friday's non-farm payrolls report, if it again shows that the labor market cooling, will strengthen the year rate cut expectations," analysts at Bitunix said in an email. Other analysts expressed concerns about the public spat between President Donald Trump and his one-time ally and billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk over tax reforms and their impact on fiscal deficit. "A public clash between Elon Musk and Donald Trump shook investor confidence, highlighting fractures within political and business leadership," said Valentin Fournier, lead research analyst at BRN. "Traditional markets held relatively steady (−0.5%), but crypto saw a sharp reaction, with $830M in liquidations as leveraged traders got wiped out." Fournier suggested maintaining a cautious, low-exposure stance, expecting sideways or further downside action over the weekend. "Any near-term rebound will need a fundamental catalyst to be sustained," he noted. More buoyantly, USDC issuer Circle's shares surged 168% on their first day of NYSE trading to close at $83.23 from the IPO price of $31, lifting the market cap to $18.5 billion. The stock saw a trading volume of over 47.8 million shares, according to the exchange. The debut, however, revived memories of Coinbase's listing in April 2021, which marked an interim bitcoin market top. The number of large open interest holders of CME bitcoin futures reached an all-time high of 217 as of the end of May, signaling increased institutional participation. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the company is in the “study phase” of potentially using stablecoins as a payment method. In traditional markets, the U.S. Treasury called on the Bank of Japan to hike rates to stall the weakness in the yen, a currency that's seen as a haven from risk. Stay alert!

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 06 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 06 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year.

Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 06 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold CAT Stock At $350?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Close-up of a Caterpillar construction vehicle with its brand logo visible, on a sunny day in Reliez ... More Valley, California, March 3, 2025. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock has lagged behind the S&P 500 index over the previous six months, falling by 12% in contrast to the S&P 500’s 2% drop. This underachievement corresponds with low dealer inventory levels, which signal weak overall demand for Caterpillar’s offerings. This subdued demand is likely attributed to the present economic environment marked by high interest rates and elevated inflation, combined with reduced price realization for the company. In spite of these challenges, we believe it is advisable to buy Caterpillar stock. While there are risks involved, we find its current valuation to be reasonable when considering these factors. Our assessment is grounded in a thorough analysis of Caterpillar’s existing valuation relative to its recent operational performance and historical financial state. Our evaluation, which looks into Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, suggests that the company currently displays poor operational performance and financial well-being. However, for investors seeking lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns exceeding 91% since its initiation. Additionally, refer to – RGTI Stock: What’s Next After An 1,100% Rally? When evaluating what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CAT stock appears slightly undervalued in relation to the broader market. Caterpillar’s Revenues have seen a slight decrease over recent years. Caterpillar’s profit margins are approximately at the median level for firms in the Trefis coverage universe. Caterpillar’s balance sheet appears weak. CAT stock has experienced an impact that was somewhat worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during certain recent downturns. Concerned about the effects of a market crash on CAT stock? Our dashboard – How Low Can Caterpillar Stock Go In A Market Crash? – provides an in-depth analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In conclusion, Caterpillar’s performance across the outlined parameters is summarized as follows: In general, Caterpillar has performed moderately across the assessed metrics, which is evident in its present valuation. Even when we consider valuation from an adjusted earnings perspective, the stock seems to be reasonably priced. Currently, CAT stock trades at 17x trailing earnings, which is below its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19x. We anticipate that the current dip in demand will be temporary for Caterpillar. We predict revenues will shrink in the low single digits in 2025 but expect a return to mid-single-digit growth starting in the following year. Nevertheless, investors should remain cognizant of potential risks. In the face of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, CAT stock could underperform the overall market, as it has in previous downturns. Furthermore, the existing weakness in demand may continue, particularly if interest rates stay elevated. Although CAT stock appears attractive, investing in a single stock can be perilous. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven record of comfortably surpassing the S&P 500 over the past 4-year period. What accounts for that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother investment journey, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Amid AI-Fueled Growth, AVGO Stock's Valuation Raises Concern

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/01/06: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom company logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) announced robust results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending in October), exceeding consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. The company reported $15.0 billion in revenue, a 20% year-over-year increase, and adjusted earnings of $1.58 per share, up 44% year-over-year. These figures slightly surpassed analyst expectations of $14.97 billion and $1.57, respectively. This growth was primarily fueled by strong demand for Broadcom’s AI semiconductor solutions and contributions from VMware. AI revenue alone surged by 46% year-over-year to over $4.4 billion in Q2, driven by robust demand for AI networking. Alongside impressive sales growth, the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin significantly expanded by 700 basis points year-over-year, reaching 66.7% in Q2. Broadcom’s outlook for Q3 also appears promising, with anticipated sales of $15.8 billion, slightly ahead of the $15.7 billion consensus. The company expects growth in AI semiconductor revenue to accelerate to $5.1 billion in Q3, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 66%. Despite these solid results, AVGO stock saw a 4% decline in after-market trading on Thursday, June 5. This dip can partly be attributed to the stock's already high valuation. The question for investors is whether to buy AVGO stock at its current price of around $250. This is a tricky decision. While the stock appears attractive, its high valuation makes it particularly susceptible to adverse events, leading to potential volatility. Our analysis, which compares AVGO’s current valuation to its recent operating performance and financial health, suggests minimal underlying concerns. Broadcom exhibits a very strong operating performance and financial condition across key parameters, including growth, profitability, financial stability, and downturn resilience. However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Separately, see – Is Amazon Stock Still A Buy After Its Recent 25% Rally? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom’s performance across the parameters detailed above is as follows: - Growth: Extremely Strong - Profitability: Very Strong - Financial Stability: Strong - Downturn Resilience: Neutral - Overall: Strong Even though the stock has performed strongly in the parameters discussed, its extremely high valuation supports our conclusion that AVGO is a tricky stock to buy. We think investors would likely be better off waiting for a further dip before picking AVGO stock. Notably, the average analyst price estimate of $254 also suggests that the stock does not have significant room for growth. Of course, we could be wrong, and investors may continue to assign even higher valuation multiples to AVGO stock given its position in the AI boom. Sometimes, valuations take a back seat when investors get eager about the outlook. In fact, evaluating valuation contextually is just one of many approaches we take when constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio. This portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. This is because, as a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a less volatile investment experience, as evident in the HQ Portfolio's performance metrics.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Broadcom shares fell more than 3 per cent in early trading on Friday, after the company's third-quarter revenue forecast failed to impress investors who have been extremely bullish on chip stocks amid an artificial intelligence boom. The Palo Alto, California-based company, which supplies semiconductors to Apple and Samsung, provides advanced networking gear that allows vast amounts of data to travel across AI data centers, making its chips crucial for the development of generative AI technology. Broadcom forecast third-quarter revenue of around $15.80 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $15.71 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Title: Bitcoin Pepe sees continued momentum as Uber plans to accept payments in crypto

Uber made headlines in the cryptocurrency space this week after revealing that it is exploring the integration of crypto payments into its platform. While the ride-hailing giant clarified it has no current plans to hold Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet, the mere prospect of accepting crypto as a payment method has stirred excitement across the digital asset community. The move, if implemented, could mark a significant step toward mainstream adoption, given Uber’s global scale and user base. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Pepe, one of 2025’s most closely watched presales, is seeing massive buying pressure ahead of its exchange debut. Only 11 days to go before a listing announcement is made on June 17. According to Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive officer of Uber, the company is studying the possibility of adding cryptocurrencies to its payment options. Specifically, the company wants to use stablecoins for cross-border payments. However, it will not invest in or hold crypto. Per the Uber CEO, who shared the move at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco, the plan is to give customers more flexibility when it comes to payment choices. “We’re still in the study phase, I’d say, but stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value,” Khosrowshahi noted. “Obviously, you can have your opinions on Bitcoin, but it’s a proven commodity, and you know, people have different opinions on where it’s going.” On this point, the broader sentiment leans bullish. Bitcoin (BTC) remains above the $100,000 mark, bolstered by signs of accelerating mainstream adoption and growing regulatory clarity. JPMorgan recently announced plans to allow its clients to buy BTC, joining a growing list of institutions including BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and even GameStop that are deepening their exposure to the asset. While recent volatility was amplified by the high-profile spat between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, Bitcoin continues to attract capital as a hedge, a store of value, and a bet on the future of decentralized finance. Fear of missing out on BTC’s continued momentum has put other well-positioned cryptocurrencies on the investor radar—chief among them is Bitcoin Pepe. Bitcoin is a $2 trillion market ecosystem, and meme coins continue to find traction as serious projects come to the fore. The Bitcoin Pepe project, which stands out as one of the best presales to invest in, is the first meme layer 2 on Bitcoin. It has emerged as one of the most anticipated token launches in 2025. With over $13.9 million raised so far, the Bitcoin Pepe presale page shows that the team will soon make a listing announcement on June 17, 2025. Presale Announcement We’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️ To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to… pic.twitter.com/Dq6o64EKvd — Bitcoin Pepe (@BitcoinPepe_) June 2, 2025 Ahead of this announcement and a potential listing soon, investors are buying BPEP at the bargain presale price of $0.0396. The crypto market is bullish on BTC and SOL, and set to tap massively into sentiment around these two coins is BPEP.

Title: Why more and more companies are buying bitcoin

The bitcoin boom is drawing the attention of more companies, who are following Strategy's lead and piling up the token in their corporate treasuries. A growing list of firms have turned themselves into bitcoin holding companies recently, incorporating the top crypto in their balance sheets along with more traditional assets like cash and bonds. To date, 80 companies have embraced the "bitcoin standard," and they own about 3.4% of the total bitcoin supply, according to a report from Bernstein Research. Many are trying to replicate the success of Strategy, which pioneered the bitcoin treasury strategy and has amassed a trove of around 554,000 bitcoins. The company's stock has outperformed the Magnificent Seven, S&P 500, and its underlying bitcoin holdings in the last 12 months. Following suit, last month, GameStop added $500 million of bitcoin to its balance sheet in its first-ever crypto purchase, and Trump Media & Technology Group announced plans to raise $2.5 billion for a bitcoin treasury. In April, the SPAC Cantor Equity Partners merged crypto firm Twenty One Capital with the goal of becoming a pure-play bitcoin holding company and saw its shares spike nearly 500% in the first week of trading. Bernstein predicts that company demand could drive $330 billion of inflows into bitcoin by 2029, with up to $124 billion of that from Strategy alone. That influx of corporate money would be bullish for bitcoin's price. However, buying bitcoin isn't a one-size-fits-all maneuver, and Strategy's success may be hard to replicate, Bernstein said. Bernstein estimates that around 2,000 global companies with market caps under $100 billion could be prime candidates for bitcoin adoption. These firms share characteristics like low growth (defined as sub-5% yearly revenue growth rate), low leverage, and high cash piles of $100 million or more. Bitcoin could be a lifeline for these types of companies. Firms with poor growth prospects might decide that their cash is better spent on investing in bitcoin than letting it sit on their balance sheet earning minimal returns. A prime example is Japanese hotel-management company turned bitcoin treasury, MetaPlanet. After years of weak profitability and stock-price stagnation, MetaPlanet began purchasing bitcoin in 2024 via cash raised from bond and equity sales. The move paid off, and the stock is up over 500% in the last year. Some larger companies, such as Tesla, have also purchased bitcoin in the past. However, other mega-cap companies have rejected proposals to buy bitcoin. Meta is the latest example, with over 99% of shareholders voting against a bitcoin treasury plan earlier this week. Proposals have also failed at Amazon and Microsoft. Not all businesses will find the same success as Strategy. The business software company has been piling up bitcoin for five years, enticing investors with equity, convertible debt, and preferred stock offerings to fund even more purchases. The stock provides investors with price appreciation, convertible debt offers more capped upside, and preferred stock provides dividend payouts. The company also has the benefit of experience after weathering multiple bitcoin price crashes. MetaPlanet and other treasury companies have issued convertible debt and equity, but Bernstein points out these companies don't have the same scale and ability to raise funds as Strategy. However, as bitcoin popularity skyrockets, it's clear that lack of experience won't stop these companies from taking a page from the Strategy playbook.

Title: Meet the 'reclusive' tech billionaire making an audacious bid to buy TikTok
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/applovin-ceo-adam-foroughi-bid-tiktok-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-06T08:50:01Z
Full Content:
Adam Foroughi tends to eschew the typical trappings of a billionaire. He has one car, and would rather it were self-driving. He rarely appears on TV or conference stages. In his downtime, you're more likely to find him at home with his five children than schmoozing on the slopes of Davos. People who know him point to his mild manner and lack of ego. His advertising technology company, AppLovin, is similarly unflashy. With an ad network that reaches around a billion daily users and a market cap more than twice that of Snap, Pinterest, and Reddit combined, it was the technology behemoth you'd never heard of. "We're a $100 billion-plus company, not many people know of us, so that's probably a flaw on me," Foroughi told Business Insider in an interview. Then came April. Ahead of a June 19 deadline, AppLovin and Foroughi, 45, made a last-minute bid to acquire the international assets of TikTok as the Chinese-owned company faces a potential ban in the US. It's an audacious move for any company, let alone one with a founder who usually goes out of his way to avoid the spotlight. It faces an uphill battle. Competition is fierce. President Donald Trump has said he's been negotiating with multiple potential buyers. Investors like Kevin O'Leary of "Shark Tank" fame and former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have signaled interest, and other tech companies are in the mix. At AppLovin, Foroughi is known for running a ruthlessly efficient ship that drives hard for profit. It's not unusual for the company to reduce head count even when it's doing well. Foroughi executes with a hands-on management style that has, at times, seen him struggle to delegate to execs who don't fit the mold. And the company's recent financial success has also caught the attention of short sellers who have raised questions about its data practices. With TikTok, Foroughi would be taking on an organization with a much bigger spotlight — and the heat that comes from running a user-generated content business popular among teens and often lambasted by parents. Most of the former AppLovin employees, competitors, and business associates who spoke with BI believe he's up to the task. They say Foroughi's smarts, as well as his tendency to forgo the marketing jazz hands and let the product do the talking, position him well to crank up the dial for TikTok's ad business. "We've been competing for over a decade, and I've never seen anyone like him — he's all around amazing, it hurts me to say it," said an executive at one of AppLovin's competitors. "He's the most talented CEO I have ever seen." Foroughi acknowledged that the TikTok bid is uncharted territory for him, but "I don't really care about 'uncomfortable,'" he said. "I do what I think is right for my business." Foroughi and his family fled Iran when he was four years old, in the fallout of the Iranian Revolution. They settled in Laguna Beach, California. His father, once one of Iran's leading real estate developers, left nearly all his wealth behind, and the family had to adjust to a more frugal lifestyle, a new culture, and a different language. "My parents had to give up a lot to get us over here," Foroughi said. "Knowing that, you always have this motivation inside you to perform." After graduating with a degree in finance from the University of California, Berkeley, Foroughi took a job as a derivatives trader. He found it a lonely existence. He wanted to build something of his own, and he wanted to work with people. He worked at a marketing agency for small businesses, which later morphed into a social media marketing company. Eventually, as the app stores of Apple and Google became dominant, he looked to apps. With a small team of engineers in Palo Alto, Foroughi created a fashion app, then a dating app. "They stunk," Foroughi said. "We got rid of them." In 2012, they launched their third attempt — an app that allowed friends to connect and send recommendations for other apps to download. This one stuck. If you were playing "Words with Friends," the app could send a push notification to your contacts, asking them to join. AppLovin was born. Like many tech companies, AppLovin — which Foroughi insists wasn't inspired by McLovin, the nerdy character in the stoner film "Superbad" — decided to pivot to advertising. It expanded from a ground-floor garage to offices on three continents, and more than 1,500 employees as of December 2024, and a market capitalization of $140 billion at the time of publication. The business model is fairly simple: It helps app developers make money and find users using in-app ads. But under the surface is a highly optimized AI-powered algorithm designed to entice businesses with the promise that chucking $1 into the machine will net $2, $5, or $10 in profit. It's a snug fit for TikTok, where ads for figure-hugging jeans, grip socks for soccer, and campaigns for major brands like Coca-Cola and Apple are slotted between consumable vertical videos. While TikTok has soared in popularity, particularly among Gen Z, its ad revenue lags behind Google, Meta, and Amazon. AppLovin thinks its adtech can help close the gap. AppLovin has also widened its aperture beyond its core gaming roots in recent months. After it opened up its ad platform to e-commerce advertisers, some said that they were excited for an alternative to Meta, which had become increasingly expensive in their hunt for new customers. Mike True, CEO of the e-commerce marketing platform Prescient AI, said AppLovin is the fourth most invested-in channel among its advertiser clients, behind Meta, Google, and Amazon Ads. "The fact that advertisers continue to invest in AppLovin, even amid a cautious market, suggests growing confidence in its long-term role within the performance stack," True said. Last year, the company posted net income of $1.58 billion at 34% margins — a margin profile almost on a par with Meta, and ahead of its closest adtech rival, The Trade Desk, which had a profit margin of 16% in 2024. AppLovin's annual revenue rose 43% to $4.7 billion. But some observers said that while AppLovin helped e-commerce advertisers extract more sales from current customers, it was less effective in driving sales from new ones. Jones Road Beauty was one of AppLovin's early e-commerce clients, but its CEO, Cody Plofker, told BI it's no longer using AppLovin. "We found it not to be very incremental with new customers," Plofker said. Foroughi said that the e-commerce product is still in its infancy and doesn't yet work for everyone. "But it will as we build it out," he added. One Silicon Valley tech veteran who interacted with AppLovin in the early years said taking meetings with Foroughi was a "breath of fresh air." He cut to the chase, no two-martini lunches necessary. "We got on calls and he'd be very to the point, versus the mindset where relationships precede business — a very Valley kind of guy," the person said. Simon Spaull was AppLovin's first hire in Europe in 2014. He reluctantly entertained the idea at first. "No one had heard of it and it was a rubbish name," Spaull said. He was soon convinced. Spaull stayed at the company for almost seven years, as it continuously posted record annual revenue, mostly growing traction through word of mouth in the gaming community. Foroughi has remained deeply enmeshed with day-to-day operations, including customer service. Up until around a year ago, he ran product and human resources alongside his CEO role. (He said he wanted to "get more involved in making sure our culture is aligned with the principles we had when we started the business.") When he's not traveling, he sits among the engineers. "You don't know what's going on in your business if you don't work with your employees," Foroughi said. Foroughi has said some of the biggest mistakes he made as CEO involved taking outside advice, including briefly hiring a chief operating officer in 2012. "I thought, what's the point of me at this company, I'm hands-on, I'm not going to defer to this hire," Foroughi said at a recent conference held by the investment bank Jefferies. He had a similar reaction after following advice to bring on a chief revenue officer and a brand ad sales team, with staffers who were paid more than the company's best engineer, the person making the actual product. "It bugged the crap out of me," Foroughi said. He scrapped the entire team. The company's strategy has been defined in part by unrelenting efficiency. Foroughi, who said he considers Elon Musk as an inspiration, counts EBITDA — or profit — per employee as one of his most important success metrics. The company recently sold off its entire mobile gaming studio business — developers of hit games like "Mobile Strike" and "Project Makeover" — deeming it surplus after the apps had been sucked for data to use for its advertising algorithms. Foroughi also showed a cut-throat streak in 2022, when the gaming software development company Unity announced its intention to acquire AppLovin's app advertising rival, IronSource. Seeking to derail the merger, AppLovin put in an unsolicited $20 billion bid to merge with Unity, but only on the provision that Unity drop the IronSource deal. Rather than make his offer to Unity's management team and the board, Foroughi went public to appeal directly to Unity's main shareholders: the investment firms Sequoia and Silver Lake. Unity's management team wasn't happy, and they rejected the hostile takeover bid. Foroughi has no regrets. "The only way to disrupt that deal" was for AppLovin to make its takeover offer public, Foroughi said. "Yes, it was a little uncomfortable, obviously." Those within Foroughi's orbit say the billionaire has a generous side. A banker who worked on AppLovin's 2021 initial public offering recalled receiving an updated draft of the registration statement and noticing that Foroughi had recently sold off around $10 million of stock, at a low price, pre-IPO. He asked Foroughi why. "He's like, 'Uh, I'm surprised you found that. Yes, I sold some stock back to the company to distribute it to the team that was under-equitized," the person said. The TikTok suitor is no stranger to US-China tensions. In 2016, Foroughi signed a deal with a Chinese private-equity firm that valued AppLovin at $1.4 billion, and would provide a $1 billion cash injection. The deal was blocked by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States on national security grounds. "CFIUS saved my ass," Foroughi said at the Jefferies Private Growth Conference earlier this year, referring to AppLovin's financial performance since. The company's methods have been called into question in recent months with four short-seller reports, published in quick succession. The most high-profile, from Carson Block's Muddy Waters Research, said AppLovin was "impermissibly extracting" data from top apps like Meta, Google, and TikTok, and targeting ads at "high value users" without their consent. The report also said AppLovin was using underhanded techniques to claim credit for sales it didn't generate. In an email to BI, Block said that Muddy Waters believed Foroughi "lied" in a March blog post, when he pushed back on the idea that the company "uses persistent user identifiers without their consent." Persistent identifiers follow users across different websites and devices, and it can be difficult for users to delete them or even know they exist. Muddy Waters said AppLovin's use of these IDs violates various platforms' terms of service and privacy laws in some jurisdictions. Block also said that Foroughi's background pre-AppLovin "supports our opinion that he should not be trusted." He was referring to Foroughi's tenure at a company called Claria, which owned a controversial eWallet software called Gator, that was said at the time to have distributed "adware" that collected users' browsing habits, and bombarded them with pop-up ads. One of Foroughi's early ad networks, SocialHour, was removed from Facebook in 2009 for violating its platform policies. Foroughi has previously said in blog posts that the short-seller reports were "littered with inaccuracies and false assertions" and were aimed at driving down AppLovin's share price for their own financial gain. He told BI that he worked at Claria for a few months as a 25-year-old. In response to questions about SocialHour, he said all companies that monetized Facebook's inventory were removed when Facebook brought monetization in-house. Some industry insiders saw the reports as confirmation of their bafflement at AppLovin's success, particularly in light of its reliance on mobile games, which are not always highly valued by big brands and agencies. AppLovin has proposed merging its company with all of TikTok's international business — not just TikTok US. Foroughi describes this as an "enhancement" to Oracle, which is TikTok's cloud provider in the US. Under AppLovin's proposal, Oracle would still provide data storage and security. Oracle didn't respond to requests for comment. AppLovin has also pitched itself as a salve for TikTok's woes. "There are really big national security and data issues, and I think we could solve them," Foroughi told BI. AppLovin says it has expertise in both handling user data and controlling complex algorithms, which it believes could help it remove biases from TikTok's content recommendation system. "I see what folks in the administration are doing now, what someone like Elon has sacrificed to give back to the country, and I think we could play a small part here," Foroughi said in an interview that took place before Musk and Trump's spectacular falling out this week. TikTok didn't respond to a request for comment. Ari Paparo, a former Googler and adtech exec who now runs the marketing media company Marketecture, said AppLovin has some big advantages in its TikTok bid: Its monster market capitalization makes the financial side feasible, it has proven monetization capabilities that could make ads on TikTok better, and it isn't "Big Tech," which has drawn antitrust scrutiny. On the other hand, he said, "The company is a bit of an unknown in DC." That may soon change. In April, Foroughi was spotted at the launch party of Donald Trump Jr.'s private members club. "​​I'm reclusive by design, so part of the challenge has been that I have to get out there, and get to be known, and I just wasn't before this," Foroughi said.

Title: The Kasselites who turned SYRIZA into… Ramallah, the 39 permits for a single foreign worker, the ferry routes and competition, and why everyone’s going crazy over Vouliagmeni Beach

Full Content:
– Hello there, you’ve probably noticed we haven’t been talking about poor Stefanos for a while now, because really, what’s left to say or write? It’s not even fun anymore — even Liagas ditched him. But now… I can’t help but give him props for the stunts he pulled on SYRIZA, which managed to change its stance on the Preliminary Investigation Committee in just three hours (he sided with Karystianou). Honestly, the way he left them high and dry over at Koumoundourou was just beautiful — like going shopping in the morning, picking out a pair of shoes, then later looking at them in your mirror, not liking them, and returning them to get something else. Pure magic, right? They were left frozen… in Palestine– Meanwhile, as all this important stuff was going on, the SYRIZA delegation was in Ramallah, led by President Famellos. And when they found out (via news sites) that the Kasselites had left them out in the cold by withdrawing their signatures from Koumoundourou’s proposal, they were absolutely stunned. The shock was twofold — not only was SYRIZA’s proposal for the Preliminary Investigation Committee effectively dead, but the internal party storm this fiasco is about to unleash is massive. Not to mention that in Ramallah they barely had any internet connection to coordinate with SYRIZA’s parliamentary secretary Kalamatianos, who was attending the Conference of Parliamentary Presidents. And now, Gaza… at home– In Athens, however, as I told you, the Kasselites’ spectacular walkout sent intra-party tensions skyrocketing. SYRIZA members were already grumbling that “it’s going to be Palestine” at the upcoming Party Congress from June 12–15, since they had previously warned the leadership about the risks of co-signing anything with those… oddballs. And now the fallout is hitting not just Famellos, but also the Polakis–Pappas duo. High treason– Anyway, one of my sources told me that when Haritsis was asked whether they’d co-sign Mitsotakis’ so-called high treason, he replied with something like, “Guys, this stuff wouldn’t hold water even with first-year students — we’ll be a total laughingstock…” Cantina Conference (Chatzidakis)– Chatzidakis had plenty to say yesterday at the Cantina Academy conference — about Greek food, agricultural production, and the water shortages that, sadly, are headed our way. But what really stuck with me was one truly disheartening stat: in order for a foreign worker to get a work permit in Greece, the state requires 39 different permits and certifications before they can start. Now you understand why the workers from countries with whom Greece signs agreements… never actually arrive. Pierrakakis (Cantina)– Equally noteworthy was Pierrakakis’ intention to request a U.S. tariff exemption for Greek agricultural products (and yes, apparently there’s a shot the Americans might go for it). Tsiaras (OPEKEPE)– Beyond Pierrakakis’ comment at yesterday’s Cantina conference — that starting from January 1, 2026, the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE) will take over OPEKEPE’s role — Tsiaras clarified that agricultural and livestock subsidy payments will continue as normal despite the system overhaul. Hardalias– Special mention of Attica’s agricultural production was also made by regional governor Hardalias, who opened (our own) Cantina conference. The Metlen factory and K.M.– One of the stops on K.M.’s (Kyriakos Mitsotakis’) tour in Volos yesterday was the old METKA factory in Nea Ionia. Now under the Metlen Group, the facility is expanding — with 50% of the work already done — as it becomes a key plant for Leopard tank production, among other things. Mitsotakis has also committed that 25% of every defense contract will go to Greek companies. Metlen’s strategic investment, budgeted at €45 million, includes new buildings and specialized machinery aimed at manufacturing advanced, high-value metal components. With K.M. was Development Minister Takis Theodorikakos, who, in coordination with Mytilineos, helped get the investment included in the strategic investment framework last December. Why everyone’s fighting over Vouliagmeni Beach– It’s not just the most popular organized beach in Attica — it’s also the most profitable. That explains the frenzy of big names (Prokopiou, Restis, Melissanidis, Kokkalis, etc.) crowding the ETAD tender for its lease. We’re talking about Vouliagmeni Beach, which can host up to 8,000 visitors daily. Last year alone, the beach received 420,000 visitors — meaning the operator could easily rake in around €5 million just from entrance tickets. Add in revenues from bars, the “Okeanida” restaurant, sports courts, and all the extra fees the private operator is sure to impose (sunbeds, ticket hikes, parking, etc.), plus new services (like food service), and this beach is a gold mine. The fact that it’s one of the only organized public-access beaches left doesn’t seem to interest ETAD (a subsidiary of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations — basically collateral from bankruptcy). I doubt ETAD even knows how many public properties it owns, but its CEO, H. Chatzigeorgiou, smartly starts with the easiest-to-monetize assets. They could have at least included some conditions to guarantee average citizens still have beach access under the new setup. But no — the only priority is to celebrate a lease deal worth €50–60 million for 20 (+10) years, a drop in the bucket compared to the €700 million debt ETAD created in the Mantonanakis affair. So the only hope left is the appeal filed with the Council of State by the Vouliagmeni Winter Swimmers Club, which will be heard in September. CEO Change (after two years) at the… immovable Fourlis -Dimitris Valachis ultimately stayed two years in the CEO seat at Fourlis, officially announced around this time in 2023 as the successor to Apostolos Petalas. The latter had steered the group for 17 years, and since Fourlis has shown it values stability, Valachis’ replacement sparked market chatter. Especially when it emerged that the new CEO would be Giannis Vassilakos, for years head of Kotsovolos and a key architect of the successful course of the chain that now belongs to PPC. Some sources now say a leadership change had been in the pipeline—though originally expected in the fall—as Valachis had completed a broad transformation plan for the Group and shareholders hadn’t provided clear guidance on the next steps. The same sources say the transition was accelerated by Vassilakos’ departure from Kotsovolos two months ago. At Fourlis, they held a high opinion of the well-known manager—also through his role at SELPE—which led to initial flirtation and then a formal offer that Vassilakos accepted, as such positions are scarce in the retail market. Valachis will oversee key Group projects until their completion and is reportedly leaving in a fully secured position, while Vassilakos will assume his duties at Fourlis on July 1. Meanwhile, the company’s general shareholders meeting on June 20 is expected to provide more details from Vassilis Fourlis himself about the CEO change and, more importantly, the Group’s new strategic direction for the years ahead, as Fourlis seems to be searching for its compass—a fact that’s also reflected in the stock market. The stock falls into the… unmovables category, even as the ASE rallies and many investors are left scratching their heads, since the Group is financially sound and remains a retail leader with IKEA as its ace in the hole. Competition or Fear of the Commission? -I don’t know why—call me suspicious or skeptical—but I find it hard to believe that competition will suddenly start working its magic on ferry ticket prices. Attica Holdings deployed two modern high-speed vessels with a total capacity of 2,000 seats on Cyclades routes, and word is they kicked off with an aggressive pricing strategy. In plain terms, Attica entered routes previously dominated by Sea Jet. It’s still early to gauge whether real competition is heating up, but let’s not forget that the Competition Commission carried out surprise inspections in the ferry sector last March and is now preparing a major investigation into the industry. The Mysteries of Kekropas -The mystery might be unveiled this morning at 9, during the annual General Shareholders Meeting in Paleo Psychiko. The game began on Tuesday, May 27. With above-average trading volume, the Kekropas stock climbed to €1.145. A week later, on Tuesday, June 3, it rose to €1.23 on heavy trades. On Wednesday, it reached €1.32. Yesterday, with 240,881 shares traded, KEKROPS shot up to €1.66, a +22% jump. It eventually closed at €1.65, up 21.32%. The rumors and “inside info” are swirling. Some believe one of the two main shareholders (Kokkalis or Peristeris) will bow out, selling their shares €0.50 above last week’s price. Others are concocting even more imaginative scenarios. The company’s market cap—which posted losses of €1.38 million in 2024—has now reached €32.8 million. National Bank and Piraeus Bank Recovered Dividend and Capital Return -The National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank quickly “absorbed” the losses from the €0.422 per share dividend cut by the former and the €0.298 per share capital return by the latter. NBG bounced back above €10.5, erasing Tuesday’s -2.76% drop. Similarly, Piraeus climbed above €5.6, recovering recent losses, with its market cap now exceeding €7 billion. Yesterday’s buying wave was accompanied by large block trades in both bank stocks. For NBG, three pre-agreed trades took place at prices between €10.3 and €10.52, totaling 2.174 million shares worth €22.513 million. As for Piraeus, four blocks were exchanged at €5.53–€5.57, with a total of 5.634 million shares changing hands, totaling €31.197 million. It’s Raining Blocks and Placements on the ASE -Lately, it’s been “raining” blocks and placements on the Athens Stock Exchange—that is, large equity placements into institutional portfolios. These packages act as new launchpads for the market. Obviously, the professional managers buying at these prices today are well aware of the market’s four-year upward trend and the fundamentals of the companies they’re investing in. In yesterday’s session, of the €227.7 million total turnover, €59.5 million came from block trades in blue-chip stocks—clearly not targeting retail investors. Over 60% of yesterday’s trading volume focused on Piraeus, National Bank, and Alpha Bank stocks. For the third consecutive session, the General Index closed in the green at +0.23%, landing at 1,839.22 points—close to the auction session high. Coca-Cola showed no willingness to support the market, closing down -1.16% at €46. Eurobank (+1.2%) traded at €2.78 with a turnover of “just” €15.4 million. OTE (+0.34%) joined in at €17.7 with €9.6 million in trades. All in all, of the €227.7 million in trading, €216 million was concentrated in FTSE25 stocks—leaving very little room for mid- and small-cap equities… Lavipharm Ramps Up Production -Lavipharm is building a new transdermal production unit at its Peania facility to fulfill third-party orders, with multinational pharma giant iNova Pharmaceuticals—owner of the Betadine brand—being the first major client. Until now, Lavipharm produced 45 million patches annually, exporting products worth around €25 million. Starting in 2026, the plant’s capacity will ramp up to 120 million patches. In liquid formulations, capacity will rise from 3.5 million bottles to 20 million, with Betadine as the flagship product. Lessons from Ukraine -Last Sunday, Ukraine successfully carried out Operation Spiderweb. We saw on TV an unprecedented drone attack on five Russian airbases, including Belaya base in Irkutsk—some 4,500 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The operation, planned over 18 months using 117 AI-powered drones, disabled 41 Russian strategic aircraft and inflicted damages worth $7 billion. While Western intelligence agencies have offered more conservative assessments, it remains a striking asymmetric blow. Greek defense and resilience firms, part of a 30-member business delegation in Kyiv, had the opportunity to be briefed by Ukrainian companies on their new defense doctrine—which changes every two weeks. The doctrine focuses on drone warfare and establishing infantry UAV units staffed by young soldiers often skilled in video games. The “robot zone”—a 30-kilometer stretch operated solely by unmanned vehicles—is the new normal on the Russo-Ukrainian front. The Greek mission returned yesterday with plans to submit concrete proposals to the country’s political and military leadership aiming to redefine Greece’s defense doctrine, invest in UAV technologies, and train personnel to meet the demands of modern warfare. Recovery Fund Pays, Superfund Delivers -Projects totaling €3 billion will be delivered by mid-2026 by the Strategic Projects Preparation Facility (PPF) of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP). By December this year, it will have completed €1 billion worth of projects. Yesterday, the Minister of Shipping and Island Policy signed off on a €9 million project to deepen the channel and harbor basin at the port of Stylida. On the same day, the Prime Minister inaugurated the fully renovated Health Center in Velestino, with €4 million in upgrades now offering quality services to local residents. These projects share a common thread: the PPF unit of HCAP, which prepared, tendered, and contracted them—along with funding from the Recovery and Resilience Facility. After Gold, Silver Takes Off Too -Silver is soaring to its highest price in 13 years, surpassing $35.8 per ounce and heading straight for $36. Since the start of the year, silver is up 24%, outperforming many major business groups. According to the Silver Institute, global demand is expected to outstrip supply for the fifth consecutive year. Meanwhile, tech stocks on Wall Street are having a field day. The S&P 500’s market cap has grown by roughly $7.5 trillion since its April 7 lows. Of that increase, 54% is thanks to the so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, Meta), which boosted their combined capitalization by $4 trillion. Notably, Tesla and Nvidia shares are up 53.6% and 42.6% respectively. Lagarde’s Political Future -Many believe that France’s conservative bloc urgently needs Christine Lagarde’s leadership to gain governability. She herself doesn’t deny that her career began in politics—she was the first female Finance Minister of a G8 country. Some thought she might leave her ECB post early to… move to Davos and take over the World Economic Forum from Klaus Schwab. Yesterday, the ECB chief shut down all such speculation, stating that she intends to serve out her term: “Let me say very clearly that I have always been and remain fully committed to fulfilling my mandate, and I am determined to complete my term.” Lagarde’s term ends in 2027. Truth be told, Christine Lallouette (her birth surname) has resigned early before—leaving her IMF post in 2019 to take the helm at the ECB. Even then, in a 2018 Financial Times interview, she had publicly denied interest in the job. Explore related questions

June 06, 2025 04:08 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "North America Non-Lethal Weapons Market Size and Growth Trends and Companies 2025-2033" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The North America Non-Lethal Weapons Market is expected to reach US$ 4.41 billion by 2033 from US$ 2.86 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 4.92% from 2025 to 2033. Due to significant defense spending, technology developments, and growing demand from the military and law enforcement, North America presently controls the majority of the market. North America Non-Lethal Weapons Industry Overview Driven by the growing need for crowd control, peacekeeping, and public safety measures, the non-lethal weapons business in North America is an essential part of the larger defense and law enforcement sector. These weapons are essential in situations when employing fatal force is either improper or prohibited by law since they are intended to incapacitate or dissuade people without causing irreversible injury. The military, law enforcement, border security, and private security companies are the main users. Important product categories include rubber bullets, tear gas, acoustic or directed energy devices, and conducted energy weapons (like Tasers). Increased expenditures in updating law enforcement infrastructure, social unrest, and geopolitical tensions all have a significant impact on the market growth in this industry. With the help of substantial government contracts and R&D funding, American businesses like Axon Enterprise, Combined Systems, and Raytheon Technologies control the area market. Moderate growth is also been observed in Canada, especially in the use of less-lethal instruments into community police strategies. Innovation and operational efficacy are being further pushed by technological developments like AI-enabled targeting and remotely controlled non-lethal drones. The sector still has to deal with issues including ethical dilemmas, public outrage over abuse, and regulatory scrutiny despite its development trajectory. Manufacturers and authorities are responding to calls for accountability and transparency by enhancing training procedures and introducing usage tracking. Furthermore, as civil rights organizations call for more stringent regulation, the regulatory landscape is becoming increasingly complicated. However, the North American market is anticipated to continue growing steadily over the next ten years due to the growing emphasis on de-escalation and non-lethal engagement, especially as social movements and urbanization put more pressure on law enforcement to use humane control techniques. Through intensive research, development, and use of cutting-edge crowd control and defense technologies, the United States plays a crucial role in the market for non-lethal weapons. To improve operating capabilities while reducing deaths, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and law enforcement organizations make significant investments in non-lethal options such as chemical agents, directed-energy weapons, and acoustic devices. Innovation is fueled by ongoing technical improvements at top defense contractors including Raytheon Technologies, General Dynamics, and Axon Enterprise. For example, Byrna Technologies reported in November 2024 that it was selling more than 500,000 Byrna SD personal security devices, which are portable CO2-powered launchers that provide less-lethal options for the personal defense and security industries. The United States' influence in international military plans is further strengthened by its exports of non-lethal weaponry, which aid allies in riot control, border security, and peacekeeping operations. Growth Drivers for the North America Non-Lethal Weapons Market Rising Incidents of Civil Unrest and Protests Civil unrest, public demonstrations, and social movements have significantly increased in North America in recent years; these events are frequently brought on by political, racial, and economic concerns. Law enforcement organizations are under more pressure than ever to control crowds without resorting to deadly force as a result of this spike. Non-lethal weapons like pepper spray, rubber bullets, tear gas, and Tasers are vital resources for defusing tense situations without causing irreversible damage. In keeping with the increasing legal and popular demands for compassionate police, these technologies provide a tactical edge in upholding public order. As a result, the market for non-lethal weaponry in North America is expanding due in large part to the growing desire for non-lethal options. Modernization of Military and Law Enforcement Agencies To address changing security threats, federal, state, and municipal governments in the United States and Canada are aggressively updating their armed forces and law enforcement organizations. Adopting cutting-edge non-lethal weapon systems that provide increased accuracy, efficacy, and adherence to human rights norms is a crucial component of this modernization. These devices are being included into counterterrorism, border security, and riot control operations when the use of lethal force would not be suitable. The need for these technologies is being sustained by ongoing investments in defense modernization and public safety initiatives, which are backed by stable government budgets. Non-lethal weapons are becoming crucial parts of modern security plans across North America as agencies look to increase operational preparedness while reducing injury. Technological Advancements The market for non-lethal weaponry in North America is expanding due in large part to technological advancement. The possibilities of non-lethal platforms are being revolutionized by developments in smart systems, acoustic deterrents, and directed energy weapons. In order to improve accuracy, flexibility, and safety in a variety of operational contexts, businesses are progressively using artificial intelligence, data analytics, and remote operation capabilities. These developments increase the effectiveness of non-lethal instruments for urban operations, tactical reaction, and crowd control. Development and deployment are moving more quickly because to government-supported R&D programs and strategic alliances with defense firms. North American manufacturers have a significant competitive edge in the worldwide market thanks to this thriving innovation environment, which also positions the area as a leader in next-generation non-lethal weapon technology. Challenges in the North America Non-Lethal Weapons Market Regulatory and Legal Constraints Both domestic legislation and international human rights frameworks strictly limit the use of non-lethal weapons in North America. To guarantee proper usage, especially in civilian contexts, law enforcement organizations must manage intricate legal obligations. Lawsuits, internal investigations, and public outcry can follow misuse or events involving excessive force, such as the incorrect use of chemical agents or Tasers. Procurement and training initiatives may be slowed down by agencies' careful implementation techniques, which are frequently prompted by these legal issues. More supervision, reporting, and accountability are also being pushed for by changing legal requirements and civil rights activism. The wider adoption and operational flexibility of non-lethal weapon systems throughout the area are therefore severely hampered by regulatory and legal restrictions. High Costs and Budget Limitations High development and deployment costs are associated with advanced non-lethal weapon systems, especially those that use technologies like directed energy, artificial intelligence, and remote operation. For smaller police agencies and local governments with tighter resources, these advanced instruments frequently necessitate large investments in infrastructure, maintenance, and training. Because of this, adoption is frequently concentrated in government agencies with more funding or in bigger urban regions. Furthermore, obtaining such technology usually involves a drawn-out, bureaucratic procurement process that includes intricate approval processes and multi-level scrutiny. By delaying implementation and lowering non-lethal weapons' overall market penetration, these administrative and financial obstacles might restrict their availability in smaller jurisdictions and impede the expansion of the sector as a whole in North America.

(Bloomberg) -- Temasek Holdings Pte Chairman Lim Boon Heng is stepping down and will be succeeded by Teo Chee Hean, marking a significant shift in leadership at the Singapore state investor. Teo will replace Lim on Oct. 9, Temasek said in a statement on Friday. As part of the change, Deputy Chairman Cheng Wai Keung and director Stephen Lee will leave the board on June 30. Director Bobby Chin will also retire on July 31. Lim has been Temasek’s chairman since August 2013. His replacement, Teo, is a former Singapore Cabinet minister who retired from politics last month after more than three decades as an elected politician. The 70-year-old was most recently Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security. Earlier on, Teo was the country’s Deputy Prime Minister and has also overseen its defense, education and home affairs ministries. Temasek is one of the biggest state-owned investment firms in the world. It grew its net portfolio value from S$223 billion ($173 billion) to S$389 billion in the 10 years through March 2024. It boasts a footprint across Europe and the US, which now hosts six of its 13 international offices. “In this era of deepening global uncertainty, we must remain clear minded on critical matters such as international relations, security, and climate change,” Teo said in a statement. He will join Temasek’s board on July 1, initially as Deputy Chairman. Lim, who is 77, focused on talent development and oversaw the board’s renewal process, increasing its international representation. He also guided Temasek through its chief executive officer leadership transition in 2021, the company said. A prolific investor, Temasek is a backer of some of the biggest companies in the world including BlackRock Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Mastercard Inc., Standard Chartered Plc and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as of March 2024. --With assistance from David Ramli.

Title: PwC Ireland boss focused on getting tech to do some heavy lifting

“The future is technology and you’ve got to lean in and embrace that,” says Enda McDonagh, managing partner of PwC Ireland, one of the Big Four accounting firms in the State. We’re speaking in his office overlooking the Liffey in Dublin’s north Docklands. The impressive double aspect view stretches down to Liberty Hall on one side and up towards Capital Dock the other way. “It’s a great view all right, but I usually have my back to it working on the computer,” he says. Technology is at the heart of the change that has been taking place on McDonagh’s watch since he took over the reins at PwC almost two years ago. “The big thing we’re trying to get after is a much better focus on the technology part of what we can bring to our clients,” he says, adding that PwC has long had a good reputation in that area. Artificial intelligence is the latest technology taking centre stage, particularly generative AI. “We’ve got stuck into AI in a big way in the past couple of years,” he says. The firm converted to Microsoft M365, which brings Copilot capability with it. As part of a global collaboration with OpenAI, it has created Chat PwC to undertake tasks that “previously would have been done by people manually researching, and helps speed up the productivity on a day-to-day basis”. Can he trust its accuracy? “You always have validation checks, but because it’s pulling from our own materials, it’s very reliable,” he says. PwC is also using Harvey, a tax and legal tool, generating first-level content to use in the practice. McDonagh says AI is not replacing jobs at the firm. “There hasn’t really been any net replacement of our people with AI. We’re trying to take tasks from our people in the administrative space and repurpose what they do,” he says. “We’re not seeing AI replacing humans, we’re just seeing it changing what the human does in the dynamic.” Last year, PwC added 1,028 staff, including 383 graduates, to bring its headcount to 3,566. McDonagh says a similar number will be added in 2025, with “broadly similar numbers” employed by the firm overall, reflecting the significant annual churn at professional services firms. PwC Ireland reported a 2.8 per cent increase in net revenue last year to €469 million. In gross terms, revenue was €569 million, up 9.6 per cent on 2023, but its “expenses and disbursements on client engagements” rose by 59 per cent to €100 million. All the figures exclude VAT and relate to income generated by PwC’s firms in the Republic and Northern Ireland. But it does not include the firm’s advisory and consulting activities in the North, which are part of the UK firm and employ about 3,000 people. Advisory services was the big drag on PwC Ireland’s numbers, declining by €16 million to €107 million. This included €63 million (up from €59 million a year earlier) in revenue from permitted non-audit services to entities that are audited by the Republic of Ireland firm of PwC. Its assurance and tax units recorded revenue increases of 9 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively. McDonagh says the slowing down in its advisory business was a combination of fewer deals and more prudence from clients in terms of discretionary spend. “What we’ve entered into a period of now is uncertainty, which is the worst possible thing for businesses,” he says by way of reference to US president Donald Trump and his flip-flops on tariffs. “This ebb and flow period of going to bed at night and waking up in the morning and the goalposts have shifted again is the really tricky part. We are seeing a real slowdown in new investment allocations, M&A is on pause and there’s a period of stasis.” Setting Trump aside, McDonagh says now is the time for Ireland to tackle its “competitiveness issues”, particularly around infrastructure, to “stay agile” and continue to attract new investment. “We’re going to have to work harder than we have done in a while on the Irish story in the context of what’s going on. The question for all of us where does the whole tariff debate land,” he says. In spite of the market being a “bit more challenging”, McDonagh says PwC’s ambition is to “keep growing” the firm, hiring in the right skills rather than making acquisitions. “M&A would take place at a [global] network level more than a local level,” he says. PwC is the smallest of the Irish Big Four firms. EY is the clear leader with annual revenues last reported at €772 million for the island. KPMG’s income was €625 million and Deloitte’s €517 million. “We just focus on what we’re doing in terms of our own strategy. There are lots of apples and oranges in those numbers. We’re happy with our own numbers ... when one of your businesses [advisory] is down by double digits and you’re still able to grow and trade through, that’s a good result for the year,” he says. In terms of this year’s revenues, McDonagh is “hopeful” of beating the 3 per cent growth achieved last time, while recognising the global economic uncertainty that exists. He declines to comment on the trends in pay and profits for Irish partners, amid reports that UK partner pay last year fell by 5 per cent on average while the firm’s profits declined by 14 per cent. In the US, the firm has been laying off thousands of staff while profits in Asia-Pacific fell as scandals in China and Australia affected the firm. “If your revenue is growing at less than it did before, that obviously has an impact, but I’m not getting into it beyond the revenue figure.” The Irish firm was itself dragged into a scandal last year involving PwC in Australia when it was revealed that a partner in its Australian tax practice had used confidential information from government meetings to assist colleagues in winning new business from multinational technology companies. It emerged that former PwC Australia tax partner Peter-John Collins, who was banned from practising as a tax agent after sharing secret information, sought in 2015 to tap PwC Ireland’s contacts with technology companies in the United States to share his insights. PwC Ireland repeatedly declined to disclose the identity of the individual in its firm who received the email. McDonagh declined to comment on the Australia issue, saying it had been dealt with “at international level” by the firm and there was no issue for the Irish business. Back to the day-to-day business at home, PwC last September enforced a three-day-a-week policy for staff attendance in its offices (it has bases in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford). “The reason we looked for a three-day commitment is because our business is about people and one of our core philosophies is about high-performing teams and people being together in that team environment so they can learn and grow and foster. Getting that three days in the office is the right balance for us at the moment,” he says. McDonagh says attendance at its headquarters in Dublin peaks at about 1,600 staff on days midweek, a similar level to pre-Covid days. “Fridays are a lost day to the city centre,” he says. “Like most everybody else, we went into Covid not thinking a business like ours could operate remotely. The business was incredibly resilient. But a huge amount of how you develop as a professional is the learned experience of being in a team environment and learning from interactions. It’s working well for us now.” Born in Southend in southeast England, his family returned to Ireland when he was two and McDonagh grew up in Tallaght, southwest Dublin. This was a time before the M50 and the Square shopping centre when there was a lot of farmland in the area. “A lot of football and other games would have been played on those spaces back then,” he says. His late father hailed from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, his mother from Clones, Co Monaghan. “I’m a big GAA fan and I probably went to more Ulster finals [in Clones] as a kid growing up by dint of spending time with my mother’s family in the summer,” he says. In spite of that childhood experience, he is a “diehard Dubs fan, there’s no ambiguity when it comes to that”, but he always has a “soft spot” for Ulster teams in the championship. His father worked in Irish Rail while his mother’s family was behind a hardware store in Clones called Morgans. He attended Templeogue College for secondary school before taking a BComm business degree in University College Dublin and joining Craig Gardner Price Waterhouse (one half of what later became PwC) in 1994 via the annual milk-round recruitment sweep of universities that the big accounting firms all do. He later followed that with a master’s degree in accounting, sponsored by the firm. Why accounting? “I had a fantastic accounting teacher in the way that, in schools, you can get. That’s what fostered the interest in accounting,” he says. He worked as an auditor, making his way up the ranks to manager level, at which point he took advantage of PwC’s international transfer system to take a role in Boston in 2000, spending three years in the US city. “I wanted to do something different. So I applied to go to the US and Boston came out of the hopper,” McDonagh says. “Being Irish there is not culturally a shock to the system. Boston is one of the more European American cities if that’s an appropriate analogy. The downtown area is not the block model of a lot of American cities. In terms of quality of life and opportunity, Boston at that time was brilliant. “I also worked a lot with the pharmaceutical industry over there, so when I came back, with the growth in pharma here, it worked out very well for me.” In 2006, McDonagh became a partner in the firm, led the assurance practice and served eight years on the leadership team of his predecessor as managing partner, Feargal O’Rourke. He was chosen to lead the firm two years ago, taking over from O’Rourke in July 2023 for a four-year term. Will he go again for second term? “That will be for the [146] partners to decide,” he says with a smile. “I’m really enjoying the role. It’s a privilege to lead a firm like this. As long as people want me around, I’m happy to stay. “If you’d asked me in 1994 did I ever think I’d be sitting in a chair like this, I’d never have thought that in a million years. But there’s an innate part of me that thinks I want to be the best that I can be.” Name: Enda McDonagh Job: Managing partner, PwC Age: 52 Lives: Blackrock, Co Dublin Family: Married, with three children: a 17-year-old son and 15-year-old twins (one boy, one girl). Hobbies: Big fan of American sports, having lived and worked in Boston for three years. Also a Manchester United season ticket holder and a “diehard” Dublin GAA fan. Something we might expect: “I’m a great believer in the importance of team. The highlight of any week is when I get a call from a client to tell me the team we have working with them have gone above and beyond to deliver for them.” Something that might surprise: “Notwithstanding my well-known support of Irish sporting teams, I was actually born in England.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Amazon lays off more staff across Goodreads and Kindle divisions

Dozens of Amazon employees working on the retailer's book divisions have been laid off. As reported by Reuters, Amazon confirmed that it's cutting jobs across the Goodreads review site and Kindle units, which impacts fewer than 100 workers. Amazon says the recent layoffs across Goodreads and Kindle divisions are meant to improve efficiency and streamline operations. The giant retailer has constantly reduced staff across various divisions over the past few years. According to CEO Andy Jassy, reducing headcounts helps the company to eliminate bureaucracy. "As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently and to better align with our business roadmap, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles within the Books organization," an Amazon spokesperson said. Layoffs recently impacted employees in Amazon's Wondery podcast division, devices and services units, communications, and in-store staff. However, Amazon's Q1 results show the retailer has added about 4,000 jobs compared to Q4 2024. After the Covid pandemic settled down, many companies began laying off thousands of staff they hired during the pandemic to respond to growing demands. The layoff trend among tech firms still exists today, and AI has amplified it. The latest data shows that in 2025, about 62,832 tech employees were laid off across 141 tech companies. Also, 152,922 tech employees across 551 companies were laid off in 2024. More layoffs are expected to occur due to declining economic growth, tariffs, and the expansion of AI across companies. Amazon is also gearing up to double down in AI investments and robotics. The company has recently announced the forming of a new agentic AI team to develop an agentic AI framework for use in robotics. Also, a new report by The Information indicates that Amazon has begun testing humanoid robots for package delivery.

Title: The Hour Was Now: Eisenhower, the Supreme Gamble, and the Note in His Pocket

“If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.” — General Dwight D. Eisenhower, undelivered statement, June 5, 1944 The message was never broadcast. Never printed. Never heard. And yet it remains one of the most remarkable documents of World War II—a plain slip of paper, scribbled in pencil, misdated “July 5,” and folded into a shirt pocket by a man shouldering the weight of freedom’s gamble. Had D-Day failed—had the beaches been bloodbaths without a breakthrough—General Dwight D. Eisenhower was prepared to take full responsibility. Not with a press conference or a military tribunal. But with a handwritten note accepting all blame. Not naming subordinates. Not mentioning the enemy. Not even attempting an explanation. He wrote, “The troops, the air, and the Navy did all that Bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.” That was the kind of man Eisenhower was. Born in Texas, raised in Abilene, Kansas, with a manner as unassuming as the plains that shaped him, Eisenhower was not the most obvious military commander in an age of brash tacticians and battlefield showmen. His pre-war career, by many accounts, was unremarkable. He had never commanded troops in battle. He spent much of his time as a staff officer—drafting plans, supervising training, and writing reports that bore the names of others. Promotions came slowly. But behind the scenes, he was absorbing everything—men, method, machinery, and morale. And yet, by June 1944, he stood at the helm of the largest seaborne invasion in human history—nearly 160,000 troops, thousands of ships, and more than 11,000 aircraft ready to hurl the full force of the free world across Hitler’s Atlantic wall. He did not blink. There is a certain fog of war that touches everything within its reach. In victory—and with the passage of time and now generations—the line of sight begins to crystallize. But clarity can be deceptive. We often miss what was obscured in the moment. Eighty-one years on, it is easy to forget just how precarious it all was. One bad decision—one shift in weather, one error in judgment—and the free world might have faltered. That burden, in full, fell to Eisenhower. Ike’s genius was not in dramatic field movements or thunderous oratory. It was in orchestration. He held together an alliance that strained at every seam—British doubt, French suspicion, American impatience, and a chorus of generals with differing agendas, stratagems, and personalities that often started but rarely ended in agreement. Montgomery wanted more troops—and headlines. Patton wanted more risk—but more than anything, he wanted to be the tip of the spear. Churchill, ever cautious about casualties and continental commitments, wanted assurance. Stalin—relentless in his demands and ruthless in his aims, but for the moment an ally—wanted action. Eisenhower gave them unity. By sheer will and balance, he united the Western Allies into a single force—British divisions, American battalions, Canadian armor, Free French brigades, and resistance networks, all united by a single banner: freedom. He soothed egos without surrendering ground. He absorbed political pressure without compromising military clarity. And when it came time to choose the day—when tides and moonlight and cloud cover all collided in a narrow 24-hour window of fate—he made the call. The hour was now. That was the feeling in the room—the moment of decision had come, and there would be no turning back. On the night of June 5, he walked the flight line of the 101st Airborne, shaking hands with paratroopers who would jump into the dark and likely never walk again. He asked their names. They joked about their gear. Patted shoulders and posed for a photo that would become a legend. These were not staged moments. He knew what he was asking—and what it might cost. But they could see it in his face—the weight, the gravity, the burden of command. Men started to pipe up, trying to cut the tension: “Quit worrying, General. We’ll take care of this thing for you.” Years later, Eisenhower admitted he might have had tears in his eyes as he walked away. “Well, I don’t know about that,” he told Walter Cronkite with a faint smile, “but it could’ve been possible.” And then he added what only a man who had borne it could say: “The hours before a major battle is joined are the most terrible time for a senior commander. You know the losses are going to be bad. And goodness knows, those fellas meant a lot to me.” They were the vanguard of victory, and the burden to go or to wait fell to him—and him alone. Eisenhower also knew what the enemy expected. For months, the Germans had been watching the wrong man. In a feat of military deception worthy of Shakespeare and Sun Tzu, the Allies had crafted Operation Fortitude—a two-pronged campaign of illusion. Fortitude South conjured the ghost of an invasion force: the First U.S. Army Group, a fictitious formation that had begun as an administrative shell under General Omar Bradley—then, quite plausibly, grown to full strength under the command of General George S. Patton. With inflatable tanks, scripted radio traffic, and headquarters near Dover, this phantom army appeared ready to strike at Calais. Meanwhile, Fortitude North hinted at a second blow aimed at Norway. The Germans believed it all. And so they held back their strongest units—waiting for an attack that would never come. And Hitler bought it. The real invasion came across the Normandy beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. Some landings were light. Others were infernos. At Omaha, entire companies were cut down before they reached the shingle. The sea ran red; the air was thick with sand and steel. But they pushed forward—over bluffs, through hedgerows, into history. That morning, Eisenhower received reports that suggested catastrophe. He kept his calm amid chaos. Chain-smoking, scanning maps, resisting premature triumph or despair. When the tide turned and beachheads were secured, he didn’t celebrate. He ordered the next phase. There was no time for indulgence. Because Eisenhower knew what followed. D-Day was not the end. It was the breach—a crack in the fortress of tyranny, made possible by those who leaped, climbed, crawled, and bled. And at the center of it all was a man prepared to shoulder the blame—one reason he was so well suited to carry the burden of victory. Years later, on the windswept cliffs above Omaha Beach, Eisenhower stood beside Walter Cronkite and reflected on the events of D-Day. He humbly deflected credit, emphasizing that it was the bravery and initiative of the American G.I.s that secured victory. But he left out the indispensable truth: they did it—because he led them. That was all, and it was enough. Charlton Allen is an attorney and former chief executive officer and chief judicial officer of the North Carolina Industrial Commission.

Eisenhower, undelivered statement, June 5, 1944 The message was never broadcast. Never printed. Never heard. And yet it remains one of the most remarkable documents of World War II—a plain slip of paper, scribbled in pencil, misdated “July 5,” and folded into a shirt pocket by a man shouldering the weight of freedom’s gamble. Had D-Day failed—had the beaches been bloodbaths without a breakthrough—General Dwight D. Eisenhower was prepared to take full responsibility. Not with a press conference or a military tribunal. But with a handwritten note accepting all blame. Not naming subordinates. Not mentioning the enemy. Not even attempting an explanation. He wrote, “The troops, the air, and the Navy did all that Bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.” That was the kind of man Eisenhower was. Born in Texas, raised in Abilene, Kansas, with a manner as unassuming as the plains that shaped him, Eisenhower was not the most obvious military commander in an age of brash tacticians and battlefield showmen. His pre-war career, by many accounts, was unremarkable. He had never commanded troops in battle. He spent much of his time as a staff officer—drafting plans, supervising training, and writing reports that bore the names of others. Promotions came slowly. But behind the scenes, he was absorbing everything—men, method, machinery, and morale. And yet, by June 1944, he stood at the helm of the largest seaborne invasion in human history—nearly 160,000 troops, thousands of ships, and more than 11,000 aircraft ready to hurl the full force of the free world across Hitler’s Atlantic wall. He did not blink. There is a certain fog of war that touches everything within its reach. In victory—and with the passage of time and now generations—the line of sight begins to crystallize. But clarity can be deceptive. We often miss what was obscured in the moment. Eighty-one years on, it is easy to forget just how precarious it all was. One bad decision—one shift in weather, one error in judgment—and the free world might have faltered. That burden, in full, fell to Eisenhower. Ike’s genius was not in dramatic field movements or thunderous oratory. It was in orchestration. He held together an alliance that strained at every seam—British doubt, French suspicion, American impatience, and a chorus of generals with differing agendas, stratagems, and personalities that often started but rarely ended in agreement. Montgomery wanted more troops—and headlines. Patton wanted more risk—but more than anything, he wanted to be the tip of the spear. Churchill, ever cautious about casualties and continental commitments, wanted assurance. Stalin—relentless in his demands and ruthless in his aims, but for the moment an ally—wanted action. Eisenhower gave them unity. By sheer will and balance, he united the Western Allies into a single force—British divisions, American battalions, Canadian armor, Free French brigades, and resistance networks, all united by a single banner: freedom. He soothed egos without surrendering ground. He absorbed political pressure without compromising military clarity. And when it came time to choose the day—when tides and moonlight and cloud cover all collided in a narrow 24-hour window of fate—he made the call. The hour was now. That was the feeling in the room—the moment of decision had come, and there would be no turning back. On the night of June 5, he walked the flight line of the 101st Airborne, shaking hands with paratroopers who would jump into the dark and likely never walk again. He asked their names. They joked about their gear. Patted shoulders and posed for a photo that would become a legend. These were not staged moments. He knew what he was asking—and what it might cost.

Title: Data centers are building their own gas power plants in Texas

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Not long ago, developers of the massive server farms talked about powering them with wind and solar energy. Now they’re bypassing the grid and building their own gas-fired power plants on site. Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. NEW BRAUNFELS — Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it. The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road. “It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees, outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.” The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this buildout promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come. The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.” Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability. “There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.” IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers — giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said. There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totalling 411,600 megawatts of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, Senate Bill 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies. Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply. Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today. Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation. Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try and slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand. This buildout promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records. Texas, with 9% of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15% of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26% of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state. GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers. For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand. “The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.” It forecast up to a 20% increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers. Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate. It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines has quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook. “If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said. The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March. About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference. “Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.” Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 megawatts of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 megawatts of gas power generation capacity. Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 megawatt cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940. “Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.” CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 megawatt gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 megawatt data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart. Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 megawatt South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 megawatt megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 megawatts from the grid. All together, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global. “There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.” However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals. Looking forward to a buildout of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer. Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power. “It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.” While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry. One failed bill, Senate Bill 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, House Bill 3356 and Senate Bill 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating. When the Legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund. Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, SB 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas or nuclear — needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass. Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state. Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue. More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40% of their income. He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the Legislature is headed with renewables. “I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.” A report published in April finds that targeted limitations on solar and wind development in Texas could increase electricity costs for consumers and businesses. The report, done by Aurora Energy Research for the Texas Association of Business, said restricting the further deployment of renewables would drive power prices up 14% by 2035. “Texas is at a crossroads in its energy future,” said Olivier Beaufils, a top executive at Aurora Energy Research. “We need policies that support an all-of-the-above approach to meet the expected surge in power demand.” Likewise, the commercial intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie expects the power demand from data centers to drive up prices of gas and wholesale consumer electricity. Even when new power plants aren’t built on the site of data centers, they might still be developed because of demand from the server farms. For example, in 2023, developer Marathon Digital started up a Bitcoin mine in the small town of Granbury on the site of the 1,100 megawatt Wolf Hollow II gas power plant. It held contracts to purchase 300 megawatts from the plant. One year later, the power plant operator sought permits to install eight additional “peaker” gas turbines able to produce up to 352 megawatts of electricity. These small units, designed to turn on intermittently during hours of peak demand, release more pollution than typical gas turbines. Those additional units would be approved to release 796,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases, 251 tons per year of nitrogen oxides and 56 tons per year of soot, according to permitting documents. That application is currently facing challenges from neighboring residents in state administrative courts. About 150 miles away, neighbors are challenging another gas plant permit application in the tiny town of Blue. At 1,200 megawatts, the $1.2 billion plant proposed by Sandow Lakes Energy Co. would be among the largest in the state and would almost entirely serve private customers, likely including the large data centers that operate about 20 miles away. This plan bothers Hugh Brown, who moved out to these green, rolling hills of rural Lee County in 1975, searching for solitude. Now he lives on 153 wooded acres that he’s turned into a sanctuary for wildlife. “What I’ve had here is a quiet, thoughtful life,” said Brown, skinny with a long grey beard. “I like not hearing what anyone else is doing.” He worries about the constant roar of giant cooling fans, the bright lights overnight and the air pollution. According to permitting documents, the power plant would be authorized to emit 462 tons per year of ammonia gas, 254 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, 153 tons per year of particulate matter, or soot, and almost 18 tons per year of “hazardous air pollutants,” a collection of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or other serious health impacts. It would also be authorized to emit 3.9 million tons of greenhouse gases per year, about as much as 72,000 standard passenger vehicles. “It would be horrendous,” Brown said. “There will be a constant roaring of gigantic fans.” In a statement, Sandow Lakes Energy denied that the power plant will be loud. “The sound level at the nearest property line will be similar to a quiet library,” the statement said. Sandow Lakes Energy said the plant will support the local tax base, provide hundreds of temporary construction jobs and dozens of permanent jobs. Sandow also provided several letters signed by area residents who support the plant. “We recognize the critical need for reliable, efficient and environmentally responsible energy production to support our region’s growth and economic development,” wrote Nathan Bland, president of the municipal development district in Rockdale, about 20 miles from the project site. Sandow says the plant will be connected to Texas’ public grid, and many supporting letters for the project cited a need for grid reliability. But according to permitting documents, the 1,200 megawatt plant will supply only 80 megawatts to the grid and only temporarily, with the rest going to private customers. “Electricity will continue to be sold to the public until all of the private customers have completed projects slated to accept the power being generated,” said a permit review by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Sandow has declined to name those customers. However, the plant is part of Sandow’s massive, master-planned mixed-use development in rural Lee and Milam counties, where several energy-hungry tenants are already operating, including Riot Platforms, the largest cryptocurrency mine on the continent. The seven-building complex in Rockdale is built to use up to 700 megawatts, and in April it announced the acquisition of a neighboring, 125 megawatt cryptocurrency mine, previously operated by Rhodium. Another mine by Bitmain, also one of the world’s largest Bitcoin companies, has 560 megawatts of operating capacity with plans to add 180 more in 2026. In April, residents of Blue gathered at the volunteer fire department building for a public meeting with Texas regulators and Sandow to discuss questions and concerns over the project. Brown, owner of the wildlife sanctuary, spoke into a microphone and noted that the power plant was placed at the far edge of Sandow’s 33,000-acre development, 20 miles from the industrial complex in Rockdale but near many homes in Blue. “You don’t want to put it up into the middle of your property where you could deal with the negative consequences,” Brown said, speaking to the developers. “So it looks to me like you are wanting to make money, in the process of which you want to strew grief in your path and make us bear the environmental costs of your profit.” Disclosure: Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, Energy Transfer, the Texas Association of Business, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Houston have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Russia’s main exchange. the Moscow Exchange, has started offering Bitcoin futures contracts. This is one of the biggest moves yet in the country’s slow but steady opening to cryptocurrencies. According to market insiders, these new contracts track the price of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which has gathered over $72 billion in assets. Trades will be priced in US dollars per lot, while settlements will happen in Russian rubles. This setup lets local traders tap into Bitcoin’s price swings without touching foreign crypto platforms. These Bitcoin futures will come out every three months, with the first batch due to expire in September 2025. Based on reports, only qualified investors will be allowed to trade on the MOEX. That means big banks, funds, and other approved financial groups can take part. Ordinary investors won’t get in on these deals. The Bank of Russia gave the green light in May 2025 for such products, but it still warns most firms to steer clear of direct crypto deals. The idea seems to be to let big players handle the risk in a controlled way. Moscow Exchange decided to price the contracts in US dollars. However, when it’s time to settle, everything happens in rubles. This approach protects Russia from sudden swings in foreign markets. A trader can lock in a deal based on Bitcoin’s value in dollars, yet get paid in their home currency. It’s a setup that keeps money inside Russia even as it ties to a global crypto product. Some analysts see this as a smart middle ground. It lets Russia join the international cryptocurrency scene but without depending on overseas platforms. 🚀 Moscow Stock Exchange Launches #Bitcoin Futures Contracts will only be available to qualified investors, with the futures tied to the value of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, quoted in US dollars, and settled in Russian rubles. (TASS) The launch follows Sberbank’s approval… pic.twitter.com/wMTRlK2Y0y — RT_India (@RT_India_news) June 4, 2025 Behind the scenes, the central bank is still cautious. It approved crypto-linked derivatives for qualified investors, but it hasn’t opened the door for everyone. Most banks and investment firms are told not to put their clients into direct Bitcoin trades. Instead, they can offer tools like these futures if they qualify. This reflects a watchful stance on digital assets. Authorities acknowledge the lure of big profits, but they also want to avoid big losses. By keeping access limited, they hope to keep any trouble contained. Meanwhile, Sberbank, the country’s biggest bank, is working on its own crypto-based product. Soon, select clients will be able to buy structured bonds tied to Bitcoin’s price. These bonds will also trade in rubles and won’t require a crypto wallet. That way, people can bet on Bitcoin without opening accounts on foreign sites. Featured image from Lonely Planet, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock buys $357 mln in BTC, ETH amid shifting whale sentiment

Time Published: 2025-06-06T00:00:02Z
Full Content:
BlackRock purchases $357M in crypto as Ethereum whales accumulate and Bitcoin whales shift to profit-taking. On the 5th of June, BlackRock purchased 2,704 Bitcoin [BTC], valued at approximately $283.9 million, and 28,239 Ethereum [ETH] worth $73.2 million. The firm’s crypto purchase in this round has amounted to a total of $357 million. Its assets under management are now at $11.5 trillion, and this move cements BlackRock’s strong foray into the digital asset space. Notably, the ETH purchase comes after the SEC approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, which are slated to hit the shelves in the next few weeks. BlackRock’s action is more of an outlier compared to the broader whale trends in the market. For BTC, the whale activity appears to be fading. On-chain data indicates that major BTC holders withdrawing their profits, as is typical during periods of price consolidation following an extended rally. So, large players are withdrawing recent gains and potentially positioning themselves for near-term corrections or re-allocations. Source: CryptoQuant But the situation is different for Ethereum. ETH whales appear to be mirroring institutional sentiment rather than unloading assets. The king of altcoins shows significant whale accumulation at comparable price points. This is in sync with growing institutional attention on ETH, especially with the ETF story gaining momentum. Source: CryptoQuant Retail investor sentiment has fallen slightly over recent weeks, leaving the market momentum trailing behind. BlackRock’s fresh investment can be viewed as filling the gap, providing supporting arms to the broader market—specifically Ethereum. While interest from the whales in Bitcoin is on the decline, Ethereum seems to be moving into the institutionally favored asset position currently. Large ETH holders’ behavior indicates long-term sentiment turning positive. Their accumulation may signal optimism about Ethereum’s future, especially with the ETF catalysts and continued network improvements.

Title: Profit-taking, not capitulation: institutions cut Bitcoin ETF exposure by 23% in Q1

CoinShares reported decreasing appeal of the basis trade as likely reason for profit-taking, resulting in declining ETF exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Institutional investors cut Bitcoin (BTC) allocations in US-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the first quarter after hedging profits waned and futures premiums compressed, a June 5 CoinShares report showed. The report assessed 13-F filings from asset managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. These investors reported $21.2 billion in Bitcoin ETF exposure as of March 31, down from $27.4 billion registered in last year’s fourth quarter. The 23% pullback outpaced the 12% slide in the overall ETF market’s assets under management and came as Bitcoin dropped 11% over the period. CoinShares tied most of the reduction to hedge funds. Those firms trimmed holdings by almost 33% after the decreasing appeal of the basis trade, which captured wide spreads between futures and spot prices throughout 2024. Advisors moved in the opposite direction. Dollar-denominated stakes decreased in value, yet Bitcoin-denominated positions increased, lifting advisors to 50% of all filer assets. Meanwhile, Hedge funds slipped to 32%, and brokerages held 10%. Advisors also dominated headcount, accounting for 81% of the 755 managers that disclosed Bitcoin ETFs. Despite selling, professional investors still commanded nearly 23% of Bitcoin ETF assets, a modest decrease from the 26.3% share reported in the prior quarter. CoinShares framed the decline as tactical rather than structural, noting that average portfolio allocations sit below 1%. The firm expects larger institutions to build positions once regulatory guidance stabilizes, internal committees approve crypto mandates, and education gaps close. Filers kept a tight focus on three products. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) carried $12.7 billion from professional investors, or almost 33% of the ETF’s assets. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $3.6 billion, while Grayscale’s converted GBTC held $2.2 billion. Together, the trio account for 85% of institutional ownership. Quarterly flows reflected that hierarchy. BlackRock drew fresh capital from Goldman Sachs and Macquarie, which opened or expanded positions worth $206 million and $136 million, respectively. Hedge fund heavyweight Millennium Management reversed course, slashing $980 million, and Bridgewater-style advisor Bracebridge Capital liquidated $335 million. Wisconsin’s state pension fund sold its entire $323 million stake, while Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala sovereign fund lifted holdings to $411 million. Institutional retrenchment contrasted with corporate treasury accumulation. CoinShares estimated company treasuries increased Bitcoin reserves by 18.7% year-to-date, reaching 1.98 million coins in mid-May. The report noted that corporations emulated Strategy’s balance sheet strategy. At the same time, professional asset managers opted to lock in gains earned since the launch of ETFs in January 2024, following Bitcoin’s crossing of the $100,000 mark in February.

Title: PR Roundup: CEO Popularity, Wilson from Cast Away is Back, Mattel Studios

Time Published: 2025-06-05T21:00:48Z

Remember Me By Nicole Schuman This week's PR Roundup looks at a new study from Morning Consult about CEO popularity and company reputation; Mattel going all in on entertainment with a new TV and film studio; and Wilson, the iconic volleyball, teaching the public about ecology and ocean waste. What happened: The American public’s relationship with CEOs is more complicated than ever. According to new data from Morning Consult, public sentiment toward top executives is sharply divided, with nearly equal numbers of U.S. adults saying they view CEOs favorably and unfavorably. The same split applies to trust: about half of respondents believe CEOs will do the right thing, while the other half aren't buying it. The findings come at a time when business leaders are increasingly stepping into the political spotlight. Consumers and employees alike are feeling the pressure and fatigue of ongoing economic uncertainty. The report also highlights how opinions about CEOs vary widely across age, income and political ideology lines, reinforcing the polarization seen in nearly every corner of public life. Key findings include: Communication takeaways: For comms pros, the message is clear: CEOs and the brands they lead must work even harder to build and keep trust. Ellyn Briggs, Brands Analyst at Morning Consult, says that the lists “underscore another important dimension of CEO public perception … oftentimes, opinions of an executive are closely tied to (or even interchangeable with) that of the company they work for.” “Case in point: Unlike Bezos or Elon Musk, Costco’s Vachris isn’t a household name or frequently making news,” she says. “And yet, because Costco is such a widely known and loved brand, he appeared as a favorite business leader for all U.S. adults and several other groups.” However, the study also notes that potential CEO-related risk increases with an increase in publicity. Briggs cites Tesla co-founder Musk in this case. “Since … Musk began inserting himself into divisive political and cultural conversations, several of the electric vehicle maker’s brand metrics, including favorability, purchase consideration and sales, have steeply declined,” she says. And if a CEO screws up once—take Martha Stewart, for example, and the insider trading debacle—companies can still recover. But when a CEO is constantly in the news for crises, that’s tough for any PR pro to overcome when it comes to consumer sentiment. What happened: The world’s most iconic volleyball, that you may remember from the movie “Cast Away,” is helping to tell the story of climate change. Ahead of the 2025 United Nations Ocean Conference comes The Odyssey of Wilson, a powerful sustainability campaign that turns real UNESCO oceanographic data into an immersive, 450-year journey that sheds light on the devastating impact of plastic pollution on our oceans. Viewers of the campaign can follow Wilson’s imagined path through the world’s oceans as a metaphor for the long-term deterioration caused by plastics. The experience traces currents, tides and climate events to visualize the volleyball’s transformation into microplastics—witnessing acidification, ice shelf collapse and rising sea levels along the way. According to UNESCO, between 1.1 and 4.9 million tons of plastic are already present in the ocean. Communication Takeaways: Led by the Onda Azul Institute, with technological support from telecom giant Vivo, the campaign transforms complex, sobering data into a story that resonates emotionally and urges action. It’s a prime example of how to make difficult concepts—in this case, high level scientific data—accessible to the regular consumer. “This project is about making science human,” says André Luis Esteves, Executive Director at the Onda Azul Institute. “By following the journey of a simple object, we illustrate decades of invisible damage caused by plastic waste—and why it urgently needs global attention. We’ve transformed data into a story people can feel.” Africa Creative, known for bold storytelling and purpose-driven campaigns, led creative development for the campaign. The integrated effort includes an immersive digital platform to explore the journey, a short film, public installations in coastal cities and live activations during major sports broadcasts. “Science alone doesn’t move people—stories do,” says Raphael Vandystadt, VP of Sustainability at Africa Creative. “By turning complex data into a powerful visual journey, we help make the invisible visible. Communication plays a strategic role in mobilizing collective action for our oceans.” What happened: While the entertainment industry seems to be on a downswing as several companies, including Disney and NBCUniversal, announced layoffs this week, some brands are going all-in on entertainment content. Toymaker Mattel, the home of Barbie, announced it would combine its TV and film divisions this week to form a complete studio. As you may recall, the “Barbie” movie became a summer 2023 blockbuster smash, grossing more than $1.4 billion in worldwide box office sales. It also received nine Oscar nominations. According to Reuters, Mattel also plans future releases to include "Masters of the Universe," “a live-action film inspired by the He-Man action figures, and "Matchbox," based on its miniature cars,” as well as a possible Polly Pocket movie. Communication takeaways: Mattel’s announcement yesterday showcases a clear turn for brands. They are no longer just advertisers—they’re becoming their own entertainment companies. James DeJulio, CEO of Tongal, a longtime Mattel partner and award-winning creator platform, believes that in-house comms must operate like content studios to stay culturally relevant. “Mattel’s move … is just the latest signal that brands are no longer content to sit on the sidelines of storytelling,” DeJulio says. “It’s about owning the narrative. For communications teams, this marks a critical turning point. To stay competitive and culturally relevant, in-house comms functions must evolve into modern content engines—developing and distributing original content that extends brand messaging far beyond press releases and earned media. Podcasts, newsletters, social video and fan-first storytelling are no longer “nice-to-haves”—they’re the new baseline.” Nicole Schuman is Managing Editor at PRNEWS. Find a Job | Post a Job

Title: Elon Musk’s Net Worth Plunges Nearly $30 Billion Amid Trump Feud

The world’s richest man sees his net worth drop as Tesla’s stock price takes a 14% hit on Thursday The public fallout between Elon Musk and President Trump on Thursday resulted in a big hit to Tesla’s stock price — and Musk’s net worth. The world’s richest man is as of now $26.6 billion less rich than he was yesterday, according to Forbes’ real time Billionaires tracker. Musk will not be needing to add another job to his plate anytime soon, though; he is still worth $380.3 billion as of Thursday afternoon, and he is nearly $150 billion richer than the next person behind him, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The big drop in Musk’s net worth came as Tesla’s stock price took its second biggest hit since COVID-19 pandemic rocked the market in 2020, with shares of the electric car company dropping 14.26% on Thursday. Tesla closed the day at $284.70 per share, down more than 20% than where it was a week ago. Thursday’s plunge coincided with Musk and Trump trading barbs on social media and in the press. The Tesla and SpaceX boss has been highly critical of the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” calling it a “disgusting abomination” earlier this week; the president weighed in on Musk’s criticism on Thursday, telling reporters at the White House he was “very disappointed” with Musk. Things escalated quickly from there, with Musk posting on X, the social media platform he owns, that the president would not have won the 2024 election without his support. Trump responded on his own social platform, Truth Social, saying Musk had been “wearing thin” and that he asked him to leave his post as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president also said the “easiest way” to slice government spending would be to “terminate Elon’s governmental subsidies and contracts” with SpaceX. Soon after, Musk said the Epstein Files had not been released because Trump was named in them. Thursday’s fallout comes less than a week after President Trump gave Musk a warm farewell from the Oval Office, including presenting him with a gold key to the White House. The president, during a joint press conference last week, called Musk an “incredible patriot” for the work he did with DOGE.

Title: Microsoft stock just hit a record high as it cashes in on the AI boom

Microsoft (MSFT) stock just clocked an intraday record on Thursday ($468.49), a milestone that caps off the company’s aggressive AI moves — and even more aggressive expectations. Wall Street isn’t just rewarding Microsoft for showing up to the AI race, it’s pricing in a future where the company leads the pack. The surge marks the company’s biggest high since July 2024 and follows a series of announcements that signal how deeply AI is baked into Microsoft’s business. Recently, the company has laid out a massive infrastructure plan, unveiled custom AI chips for Azure, and kept investors buzzing with sharp revenue growth across its cloud and productivity divisions. In many ways, Microsoft’s stock high isn’t just about AI — it’s about the company’s ability to industrialize it. The AI narrative isn’t new, but Microsoft is increasingly making it look real. While Google (GOOGL) is experimenting and Amazon (AMZN) is largely building behind the scenes, Microsoft is out there productizing — and monetizing — faster than most expected. GitHub Copilot is gaining traction. Microsoft 365 is increasingly AI-native. Azure has become the go-to cloud for businesses that want ready-to-go AI tools. Microsoft had a rocky start to the year (a 10% decline from its July 2024 peak) but it’s rebounded sharply, thanks largely to strong cloud growth — Azure revenue jumped 33% in the 2025 fiscal third quarter — and continued momentum in AI integration. Now, Microsoft’s stock is up about 12% year-to-date (and 30% since April of this year), easily outperforming fellow tech giants such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia (NVDA). The recent rally has added over $800 billion to Microsoft’s market capitalization, and the company’s performance positions it as one of the more stable, high-conviction bets in a tech sector that is increasingly divided between hype and execution. Earlier this year, Microsoft committed to spending $80 billion in fiscal 2025 — most of it on AI-enabled data centers. That’s a figure that suggests CEO Satya Nadella sees AI as Microsoft’s cloud moment all over again. And the market seems to agree. Behind the rally, analysts are circling with revised playbooks. The average analyst price target shows almost double-digit potential over the coming year. And some analysts predict that Microsoft’s AI initiatives could bring in over $10 billion annually. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The recent rally has added over $800 billion to Microsoft’s market capitalization, and the company’s performance positions it as one of the more stable, high-conviction bets in a tech sector that is increasingly divided between hype and execution. Earlier this year, Microsoft committed to spending $80 billion in fiscal 2025 — most of it on AI-enabled data centers. That’s a figure that suggests CEO Satya Nadella sees AI as Microsoft’s cloud moment all over again. And the market seems to agree. Behind the rally, analysts are circling with revised playbooks. The average analyst price target shows almost double-digit potential over the coming year. And some analysts predict that Microsoft’s AI initiatives could bring in over $10 billion annually. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Microsoft stock just hit a record high as it cashes in on the AI boom

Microsoft (MSFT) stock just clocked an intraday record on Thursday ($468.49), a milestone that caps off the company’s aggressive AI moves — and even more aggressive expectations. Wall Street isn’t just rewarding Microsoft for showing up to the AI race, it’s pricing in a future where the company leads the pack. The surge marks the company’s biggest high since July 2024 and follows a series of announcements that signal how deeply AI is baked into Microsoft’s business. Recently, the company has laid out a massive infrastructure plan, unveiled custom AI chips for Azure, and kept investors buzzing with sharp revenue growth across its cloud and productivity divisions. In many ways, Microsoft’s stock high isn’t just about AI — it’s about the company’s ability to industrialize it. The AI narrative isn’t new, but Microsoft is increasingly making it look real. While Google (GOOGL) is experimenting and Amazon (AMZN) is largely building behind the scenes, Microsoft is out there productizing — and monetizing — faster than most expected. GitHub Copilot is gaining traction. Microsoft 365 is increasingly AI-native. Azure has become the go-to cloud for businesses that want ready-to-go AI tools.

Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. From the budget-friendly iPhone SE to the cutting-edge iPhone 16 Pro Max, there's an iPhone out there for every need and budget. But no matter which model you're looking to get your hands on, there's a good chance you can pick it up for less if you know where to look. Carriers and retailers are almost always offering some serious savings in the form of trade-in offers and new line discounts, and we've broken down some of the best bargains available below. CNET's Adam Oram has spent years tracking down and sharing the best deals from across the internet to help shoppers get the best savings, and he's found the latest iPhone offers to help you get your preferred model at a competitive price. You'll find solid discounts on premium models like the feature-packed iPhone 16 Pro Max, alongside offers on more affordable options like the new iPhone 16E. Some carriers still offer devices at no cost if you qualify. Keep in mind that direct discounts are relatively scarce and most offers listed will require either trading in a device or activating a line. Most deals also require a commitment to a 24- or 36-month contract. Below you'll find the best deals on the iPhone 16, iPhone 16E, iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13 and iPhone SE 2022, grouped by generation. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. There are a lot of savings to be had on all the models in Apple's latest iPhone 16 lineup, including carrier deals that can nab you the device free if you have an older device to turn in. Trading in your old phone at Apple could save you up to $650 on any iPhone 16 model. Previous-gen iPhones will net the biggest discount but Apple also accepts devices from Samsung, Google and OnePlus. You'll also get 3% cash back if you buy it with your Apple Card*. If you let Apple connect you to a carrier, you could save up to $1,000 in trade-in credit. T-Mobile is offering many trade-ins and new-line discounts on the iPhone 16 series. Exchanging your old phone will save you up to $1,000 if you have an Experience Beyond or Go5G Next plan, which scores you the basic iPhone 16, 16 Plus or 16 Pro free. People on an Experience More or Go5G Plus plan can get up to $830 off when they trade in an old device, which still scores you a free basic iPhone 16. Those on most other plans will get up to $300. T-Mobile is also offering savings when you switch your number over from another eligible carrier. Switching to an Experience Beyond or Go5G Next plan will save you $1,000 and an Experience More or Go5G Plus plan will save you $830. You can also save $830 with a new line and a trade-in. There also are special offers for military members, first responders and folks older than 55. AT&T is offering some serious trade-in savings at the moment. You'll get $1,000 off for phones valued at $290 or more, $830 off for phones valued at $130 or more and even phones valued at just $35 will still score $350 in trade-in credit. Note that you must switch to an eligible unlimited plan to get these offers and the discount will be applied as bill credits over 36 months. AT&T is also offering a special online-only offer of $200 off with the activation of a line. Adding a new line on a qualifying unlimited plan at Verizon will save you $830 on the basic iPhone, $930 on the iPhone 16 Plus, $1,000 on the iPhone 16 Pro and $1,200 on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which means you can get all four models free right now. You can also get up to $1,000 off with a new line and an eligible trade-in. Discounts are applied as bill credits over 36 months. Best Buy isn't carrying any unlocked iPhone 16 models right now but is offering some savings through AT&T or Verizon. AT&T customers can save up to $830 on the basic iPhone 16 or up to $1,000 on the 16 Pro and Pro Max models with a trade-in and qualified activation. If you're a Verizon customer, an eligible trade-in and qualified activation could save you up to $930 on the basic 16 and 16 Plus or $1,000 on the 16 Pro and Pro Max. Target is offering up to $830 off the basic iPhone 16 and 16 Plus or $1,000 off the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max with an eligible trade-in. Just note that you'll have to visit your local Target store in person and sign up with AT&T to take advantage of these offers The new budget-friendly iPhone 16E is now available and there are plenty of iPhone 16E deals for those wanting to save on Apple's newest member of the family. When you trade in an eligible device, Apple offers savings on the new iPhone 16E. Trading in an old phone could save you up to $650, which can potentially score you the basic 128GB model free. However, that discount is only available if you're trading in the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which would be a bit of a downgrade. For the iPhone 14 series, the most you'll save is $460, which is still a solid deal for this affordable model. Note that the older your phone is, the less you will potentially receive for a trade-in device. Apple phones also earn more than Samsung or Pixel devices. If you order the iPhone 16E at Best Buy and sign up with a carrier, there are ways to save. A qualified activation with Verizon and a trade-in of your old or damaged phone will save you up to $600. If you're an AT&T customer, a qualified activation on an eligible unlimited installment plan can save you up to $384, which drops the starting price to just $6 per month. Discounts will be delivered via bill credits over 36 months. Customers can order the new iPhone 16E at T-Mobile and there are a few ways to save. If you're trading in an old phone, you can get it free if you're on an Experience More, Experience Beyond, Go5G Plus or Go5G Next plan, while those on most other plans will save up to $300. Adding a line on most plans will save you $240, which reduces the price to $15 per month. You can also get it free with a new line and a trade-in or when you switch your number from another carrier. There are also several special offers for military members, first responders and people 55 and older. Verizon is offering $420 off the iPhone 16E when you sign up for a line on the Unlimited Welcome, Plus or Ultimate plan, which drops the price down to $5 per month. You can also save up to $600 with an eligible trade-in and activation of a new unlimited line, which scores you the 128GB model free. AT&T is offering up to $384 off the iPhone 16E when you purchase it on an installment plan, as long as you have (or switch to) an eligible unlimited plan. That reduces the starting price to just $6 per month with no trade-in required. You'll receive the discount via 36 monthly bill credits. US Cellular is offering many ways to save on the iPhone 16E. Activating a line or account on a qualifying line will save you up to $830, which scores you the 128GB or 256GB model free. You can also get the 512GB model free with a new line and an eligible trade-in. US Cellular is also offering $350 off with a new prepaid line and the port-in of an existing number, which drops the starting price to $250. Order your iPhone 16E at Boost Mobile and sign up for the Unlimited Premium plan ($60 a month), and you can snag a new iPhone for as little as $300. You can also pay full price for the phone upfront, which gets you a free year of service. You can order the iPhone 16E from Walmart for $549 or a little more than $15 per month for 36 months with an eligible activation with AT&T. The iPhone 15 series hit shelves in September 2023. And although the phones in this lineup are a generation old, they still have plenty to offer, with the basic model even retaining a spot on our list of the best phones. Plus, it's pretty easy to get your hands on one of these previous-gen models for less right now, which makes them a good value for Apple users on a budget. Apple isn't offering any direct discounts on the iPhone 15 series at the moment but it has a trade-in program that can save you hundreds on a new iPhone 15. Technically, you can save up to $650 but that's only if you're trading in another iPhone 15, which is an unlikely scenario. For the iPhone 14 series and older, the most you'll save is $460. The iPhone Upgrade Program or Apple Card financing (and cash back) are also options. AT&T is offering discounts in the form of monthly bill credits when you buy a new iPhone 15 on an installment plan. People who have or switch to an eligible unlimited plan can get the basic iPhone 15 for just $8 per month, which is $442 off the usual price. This offer also knocks $384 off the price of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which drops it to just $21 per month. The iPhone 15 Pro is also discounted but only the 1TB model is still in stock, which is available for $31 per month. At the moment, there aren't any discounts available on the iPhone 15 Plus. Adding a line on an Unlimited Welcome, Plus or Ultimate plan gets you the iPhone 15 or 15 Plus free, with no trade-in required. These discounts are applied in the form of monthly bill credits over 36 months. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are currently sold out. The iPhone 15 Pro is sold out at T-Mobile, but there are plenty of ways to score some savings on the other models. Trading in an old phone will save you up to $1,000 if you're on an Experience Beyond or Go5G Next plan, which will net you the basic iPhone 15 or 15 Plus free. If you're on an Experience More or Go5G Plus plan, you can save up to $830 with an eligible trade-in, which still gets you the basic iPhone 15 or 15 Plus free. Those on other eligible rate plans will only save up to $300 with an eligible trade-in. You can also get it free with a trade-in and the activation of a line. T-Mobile even offers a discount of $630 when you switch your existing number over from another carrier. And military members, first responders and people older than 55 can take advantage of special offers for up to $800 off. Best Buy isn't offering any direct discounts at the moment but the retailer has a trade-in program where you can exchange your old phone for savings. You can also save an extra $100 if you connect your phone to a carrier. And all iPhone 15 purchases come with some freebies, including two free months of Apple TV Plus and three free months of Apple Fitness Plus, Apple Music and Apple Arcade -- as long as you're a new or returning subscriber. The iPhone 14 series is still a popular line of phones and comprises the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and top-spec iPhone 14 Pro Max. Apple discontinued the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max in September 2023 so finding these phones in new condition is getting tougher but they're still a solid value when you can find them in stock and on sale. Only the basic iPhone 14 is still available at T-Mobile. You can snag one free with an eligible trade-in, as long as you're on an Experience Beyond or Go5G Next plan. Those on other eligible rate plans can save up to $300 with a trade-in. You can also get it free with a new line and trade-in, or when you switch your number over from another carrier. If you're only activating a new line on a qualifying plan, you'll still save 50% (up to $315). T-Mobile also has exclusive offers for military members, first responders and people older than 55. AT&T isn't offering any direct discounts or special offers on the iPhone 14 right now, but you can save with an eligible trade-in. You'll also save $200 on a line when you set it up online. AT&T is also offering $100 off when you buy a connected device with a separate line, including a pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses. If you switch over to AT&T, the carrier will give you up to $800 to break your contract with your current phone service provider. Add a line on an Unlimited Welcome, Plus or Ultimate plan and you can get the iPhone 14 or 14 Plus free at Verizon. The discount comes in bill credits over 36 months and there's no trade-in required. Note that Verizon is only carrying certified refurbished models of the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, although you can still pick them up at a discount with a new line. Best Buy isn't offering any discounts on the iPhone 14. However, the retailer has its own trade-in program where you can score extra savings of up to $330 in exchange for your old phone. You can also save an extra $100 if you let Best Buy help you connect your phone to a carrier. Best Buy isn't carrying any new 14 Pro or Pro Max phones, although it does have some refurbished models. The iPhone 13 may not be Apple's flagship series anymore but these are still solid phones worth considering -- especially for folks on a tight budget. Like the iPhone 14 series, these 2021 models are getting pretty tough to find in new condition and there are no active deals right now. If the new $599 iPhone 16E is a little outside your budget, don't worry. You can still find the even more affordable iPhone SE, which was updated in 2022. You can grab it for as low as $149 if you get it prepaid from Straight Talk or free when you switch your number over to Total Wireless. With this discount, it's the most affordable iPhone on the shelves right now, although it's getting pretty tough to find it in stock.

Title: Ethereum ETF Holdings Spike as BlackRock Snaps Up $560 Million in ETH

Ethereum (ETH) trades within a narrow range, with major institutional investors increasing their exposure. According to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, BlackRock has accumulated over 214,000 ETH over the week—worth approximately $560 million. The move coincides with a period of price consolidation for ETH, which has hovered between $2,500 and $2,700 over the last several weeks. Despite low price volatility, ETF inflows have steadily risen, pointing to growing institutional confidence. BlackRock’s activity suggests a deliberate accumulation strategy. By building positions during a period of market calm, the firm appears to be positioning itself ahead of potential macro or regulatory shifts. Data confirms the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has attracted sustained inflows since U.S. regulators approved Ethereum spot ETFs earlier this year. According to data from SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs posted $109.43 million in net daily inflows, of which BlackRock alone accounted for $77.06 million. This marked the 12th consecutive day of positive inflows into ETH-based funds. By contrast, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded significant outflows on May 30 and June 2—totaling $561 million. While inflows briefly returned to the firm’s Bitcoin product with $58 million on Tuesday, the figure was still dwarfed by Ethereum’s ETF momentum. TheBlock’s Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator shows Ethereum’s next major resistance zone between $2,726 and $2,856. Roughly 4.13 million ETH—held by 2.7 million addresses—were acquired within this band. Meanwhile, over 12 million ETH sit in the out-of-the-money zone at an average cost basis of $2,613. This imbalance suggests that many investors are still in accumulation mode. The at-the-money zone remains larger than immediate resistance, indicating that ETH may be under less near-term sell pressure. Joao Wedson, CEO of analytics firm Alphractal, said in a tweet that significant market-maker activity at lower levels could signal a breakout is forming. He identified a short-term target of $2,830 following a break above $2,660. Wedson also highlighted $2,556 as a key stop-loss threshold based on aggregated liquidation data. Ethereum’s daily chart shows modest strength. A bullish crossover between the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages recently formed, supporting the short-term outlook. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates renewed buyer interest. BlackRock’s $560 million Ethereum purchase via the iShares Ethereum Trust signals a strategic long-term commitment, not a speculative trade. Despite Ethereum’s price staying in a tight range, institutional interest continues to build.

Title: 'We live in a terrarium': Larry Fink on why today's leaders should be 'more guarded'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-leadership-advice-guarded-social-media-populism-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-05T18:28:50Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has some words of wisdom for leaders navigating the age of populism and social media: Watch what you say. "You have to be a lot more guarded," Fink said on Thursday. "I can't say everything I really want to say to all of you right now," he joked to the audience attending Forbes's Iconoclast Summit. "The reality is you have to be a lot more systematic in what you say and how you say it internally or externally," he said, adding, "I mean, we live in a terrarium today. We live in a glass bottle." The billionaire cofounder of the world's largest asset manager is no stranger to backlash over the firm's business decisions. Fink's embrace of "ESG" investing, for example, has been derided by Republicans as "woke capitalism," while drawing criticism from climate groups for not going far enough. The state of Texas only recently removed the asset manager from its investment blacklist, allowing the state to reinvest with the firm, after BlackRock withdrew from climate-focused initiatives like the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. "You have to lead differently," in this era, Frink said. "You have to be a lot more thoughtful in every word you say." He said this holds true when it comes to internal messaging as well. "If you can't get your messaging properly with your employee base, and we have 23,000 employees at BlackRock globally, how are you going to get those messages across to all your clients?" Fink said. Fink told the audience gathered at the Cipriani's restaurant in downtown Manhattan that leaders also need to be led. He gave the example of a trip to the firm's European officers following President Trump's "Liberation Day" trade tariffs were unveiled. "The Europeans were quite frightened," Fink said. They were frightened about the potential for dramatic changes to US policy and the implications this could have on the culture and direction of their US-based employer. "Is BlackRock changing too?" Fink recalled them saying, before he reassured them that it would not. "It was just a wake-up call," Fink said. "Even for me, and I think I'm pretty well experienced in this stuff. Again, when there's great moments of uncertainty, even your top leaders need to be led." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: Circle Soars In First-Ever Stablecoin IPO, Making CEO A Billionaire
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/06/05/circle-soars-in-first-ever-stablecoin-ipo-making-ceo-a-billionaire/

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, at the Token2049 conference in Singapore in Sept. 2024. Photographer: Suhaimi Abdullah/Bloomberg Circle, the company behind the $61 billion stablecoin USDC, made a roaring debut on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, becoming the first stablecoin issuer to go public and making CEO and cofounder Jeremy Allaire a billionaire. Shares surged as much as 235% after Circle and some of its shareholders raised nearly $1.1 billion in an initial public offering that was upsized twice amid heavy investor demand. The stock opened at $69, more than double its IPO price of $31, and climbed as high as $103.75. The offering included 34 million shares from Circle and other shareholders including Allaire, up from the 32 million shares announced earlier this week and 24 million initially. The IPO was priced well above its initial $24–$26 range and even its revised $27–$28. Based on Circle’s 2 P.M. stock price of $86, Forbes figures Allaire has a net worth of at least $1.7 billion. A representative for Circle has not yet responded to a request for comment about Allaire's net worth. BlackRock, already an investor, and Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, were among the reported buyers. The deal was led by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, alongside 12 other underwriters. “We’re thrilled with the demand,” Circle CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen told Forbes. “We saw a wide range of investor interest from traditional mutual fund complexes through to high-conviction, long-oriented pools of private capital within the broader hedge fund space, as well as various sovereign wealth funds. I think it says that the investor community is understanding that we are on the precipice of what we here call the new internet financial system.” Circle’s listing arguably marks crypto’s most significant public market event since Coinbase’s 2021 IPO. The New York-based firm is a pure-play stablecoin business: USDC is the world’s second-largest stablecoin, making up 27% of the market behind Tether’s 67%. While originally used for crypto trading, stablecoins are increasingly drawing attention from financial giants and tech firms—among them Fidelity Investments, Bank of America and Meta—as rails for payments and cross-border transactions. Since launching USDC in 2018, Circle has processed over $25 trillion in transaction volume, nearly $6 trillion of which occurred in just the first quarter of 2025. The company has long positioned itself as the regulated, transparent alternative to Tether, publishing detailed audited reserve disclosures. In 2024, Circle reported $1.68 billion in revenue and $156 million in net income, up from $1.45 billion in revenue and $268 million in profit the year prior. But its business remains highly concentrated: More than 99% of revenue came from interest income on the cash and Treasurys backing USDC. In its S-1 filing, Circle warned that a 1% drop in interest rates could wipe out $441 million of that revenue. Fox-Geen says diversification is underway: “We have a set of product investments which we have started monetizing recently, which range from subscription and services revenues, such as our blockchain network partnerships, through to transaction revenues, where we monetize certain of the flows across the network where users of the network wish to use a value added service which they're willing to pay for.” Those initiatives generated $20.7 million in Q1. Modest for now, but growing quickly, he noted. The company’s distribution model, however, remains costly. In 2024, Circle paid over $1 billion in distribution fees—$900 million of it to Coinbase. Tether, by contrast, doesn’t pay distributors to maintain dominance. The road to public markets was not a straight one. Circle scrapped a $9 billion SPAC merger in late 2022. In 2023, the company was hit by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, where it had deposited a portion of its reserves. Though Circle ultimately recovered the funds, USDC’s market capitalization took months to rebound. In April, Circle reportedly fielded acquisition offers from both Coinbase and Ripple valuing the company at around $5 billion. It opted instead to go public, filing confidentially for an IPO early this year. It’s likely a bet that regulatory clarity will finally be arriving, and with it, a premium for compliance. “Becoming public has always been part of our strategy,” said Fox-Geen. “This is a multi decade transformation of the plumbing of the financial services industry, but that understates just how profound a technology upgrade this really is.”

Title: Why Microsoft has created its own print magazine

Signal is Microsoft’s response to a world of noise and ephemeral content. Signal is Microsoft’s response to a world of noise and ephemeral content. by Tom Warren Of all the many ways Microsoft could mark its 50th anniversary, I wasn’t expecting the software maker to launch a magazine. “It’s our answer to a timely question: How do we earn trust and hold attention in an age of scroll and skim? How do we create Signal in a world of noise?” asks Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s chief communications officer. Microsoft’s response to a world of people doomscrolling on X and TikTok is a print magazine that you can thumb through in peace and quiet. The first issue of Signal is 120 pages with a focus on AI, both as a topic and, to a small degree, a means of production. Microsoft hopes the magazine will bypass the digital world and reach business leaders directly every few months. “People are overloaded with information, and a lot of the information is pretty ephemeral,” says Steve Clayton, the executive editor of Signal, in an interview for Notepad. “[Signal is] partly a reaction to that, which is: how do we create something that’s more thoughtful and has some more permanence, and is a bit longer-lasting than a five-second TikTok video?” Signal looks like any high-quality magazine you’d find at a newsstand, complete with deep dives on Microsoft technologies, interviews with Microsoft executives, and some lighthearted quiz and trivia sections to round off the magazine format. It’s a magazine from Microsoft’s comms team, so don’t expect to read anything about Amazon or Google in here, or material that strays beyond a clean and tidy image of Microsoft. Instead, you’ve got guest appearances from CEO Satya Nadella and co-founder Bill Gates in the premiere issue I’ve read. The deeper stories on Microsoft will look very familiar to anyone who has read Microsoft’s Source work, where the company writes its own stories about how its technology is being used throughout the world. These digital stories are a good reminder of how influential Microsoft is, but they’re not yarns that the company can easily pitch to journalists like me because they’re simply too self-promotional. Signal feels like a physical manifestation of Microsoft’s strategy with its Source stories. “Microsoft Source and Microsoft stories has been our opportunity to go direct,” says Clayton. Microsoft has printed 1,500 copies of Signal that it’s distributing at its own business-focused events. “Fifteen hundred is a good place to start, and the uptake has been really good. There’s been a lot of demand for it,” says Clayton. “If we get through those and see more demand that we can’t fulfill, then we’ll go and do another print run.” The publication schedule is still in flux as Microsoft gauges interest. “We’re starting to think about what the next few editions will be, and based on the reaction to this one, that will determine the size of the next print run,” says Clayton. Microsoft didn’t want to print 15,000 and have them sitting on shelves at its events, so it’s treading carefully for now with plans to publish every quarter or so. A big inspiration for Signal was the Costco magazine that’s distributed to millions of members every month, a reach that makes it one of the largest magazines in the country and a steady way for the retailer to reach its customers. “The facility, the team, and production that they’d set up, we have a lot of that capability already, so it was an opportunity for us to turn our attention to a new thing,” says Clayton. Costco mails out more than 15 million copies of its magazine with each issue, but Microsoft isn’t expecting to scale Signal to those heights yet. “I don’t think we’re going to go and compete with Costco’s magazine anytime soon, put it that way,” says Clayton. Signal, as you might expect, is very focused on how Microsoft’s technology is being used by businesses. That means it’s also very much focused on AI. I counted mentions on more than 50 of its 120 pages. There’s a story about a women’s soccer team in Spain that was recently promoted and grappled with the use of AI, a deep dive into how Vodafone is deploying AI, and another piece on how Microsoft’s research labs are using AI for science. There are also parts of Signal that look more clearly like promotional material for companies using Microsoft technology, or the types of customer stories that wouldn’t interest readers of The Verge. But there are also interesting, meatier stories. The Vodafone piece might sound like pure marketing, but I could see how it might be useful as a less technical guide for other CTOs thinking about rolling out AI. Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant helped build small parts of the first issue of Signal, but it’s unclear how deep that’ll go in story creation in future issues. “We certainly didn’t go in intentionally and say that we’re going to have an AI-generated story,” says Clayton. “At the back of the magazine there’s a small quiz that’s generated by Copilot, so you could argue that piece is generated by AI.” Clayton also says he used the deep research functionality of Copilot to help develop Microsoft’s periodic table. “I definitely see us using AI to help us do some of the research and production, and I think we’re open to what we can do with AI in the magazine, but it’s not something that’s front and center,” he says. Microsoft has been working with the Slow Journalism Company in the UK to help produce Signal. “I’ve long been a fan of their work and they were a big help in writing some of the pieces as well, and we’ll continue to work with them,” says Clayton. “They have great writing and editorial talent, and also they just know how to produce a magazine.” Learning how to create a magazine has been a big part of Microsoft’s experiment with Signal. A magazine has to have lighter pieces of content, and it all needs to be arranged in a compelling way to keep readers engaged. There’s a fine art to keep people turning a page in a magazine that’s different from getting someone to click on an online piece. I’ve enjoyed reading Signal, especially the soccer piece and the 50-year anniversary stories. Like any magazine there are parts I could happily skip over, but the design, attention to detail, and stories here are surprising for Microsoft’s first issue. I’m very curious to see whether a trend back to print emerges across other tech companies, and how many hands Signal actually ends up in. I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else. If you’ve heard about any of Microsoft’s secret projects, you can reach me via email at notepad@theverge.com or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where I’m tomwarren.01.

Title: Circle Shares Opens at $69 on NYSE Debut, Signaling Strong Appetite for Stablecoin Issuers

Shares of Circle (CRCL) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday, opening at $69 a share in early trading. The stock at one point surged to as much as $100, more than 200% above the $31 price it had set the night before. The company announced late Wednesday that it sold roughly 34 million shares in its initial public offering, raising $1.1 billion and landing a valuation of $6.9 billion. The listing marks Circle’s long-awaited arrival on public markets after previous attempts, including a failed SPAC deal in 2021. Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management expressed interest in buying as much as $150 million worth of the circle shares, with BlackRock also intending to buy 10% of the shares, according to SEC filings and Bloomberg. The IPO draws comparisons to crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) 2021 IPO on Nasdaq, which saw a volatile session with shares trading as high as $430 before tumbling to $200 one month later. Elsewhere, crypto-linked stocks, including Coinbase and Strategy (MSTR), along with bitcoin BTC$108,556.13, were trading lower on Thursday. Circle's shares seem to have stabilized around $80 to $83 per share. Circle's debut lands in a market still wrestling with an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Earnings season is winding down, and more companies have flagged weak outlooks for the next quarter than strong ones, suggesting that U.S. stocks could face added pressure in the months ahead. However, Circle’s core business — issuing the dollar-pegged USDC token — is benefiting from a different trend. Demand for stablecoins has grown in 2025, partly due to progress on U.S. regulation. Policymakers have signaled they’re moving closer to establishing clearer rules, which could help legitimize and expand the use of stablecoins in mainstream finance. Deutsche Bank predicted in a report last month that stablecoins are on the verge of going mainstream. The bank cited their growing role in digital payments, cross-border settlement and treasury management while also reinforcing the U.S. dollar's dominance globally. Circle’s IPO may be early evidence of that shift — an investor bet not just on a crypto company, but on stablecoins becoming essential financial infrastructure.

Title: Top 50 Women in Web3 and AI
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2025/06/05/top-50-women-in-web3-and-ai
Time Published: 2025-06-05T16:35:18Z

At first glance, throwing Web3 and AI into a headline might seem like a bad example of buzzword soup, the practice of media companies trying to game the algorithms (and your attention) by using a bunch of the most-searched words of the day. But CoinDesk has been following the slow integration of applications that track vast amounts of data on a public blockchain and the artificial intelligence capable of making sense of that data for a decade. In the first-ever CoinDesk Top Women in Web3 & AI list, we consulted with a panel of women judges: Julia Bonafede, Co-Founder of investment management firm, Rosetta Analytics; Olivia Bolec, Google’s Enterprise Global Account Director; Sarah Idahosa, Founder of Women in Defi; Saruul Krause-Jentsch, Head of Podcast at Spotify for Central Europe; and Amélie M., Founder and President of the French branch of the Association of Women in Crypto. This list was brought to life through a collaboration between CoinDesk and Proof of Talk, hosted by XVentures. To help ensure the list selection process was as unbiased as possible we sought out multiple, diverse perspectives. An initial public outreach on social media platforms and to our deeply sourced expert analysts, resulted in more than 300 nominations from every geographic region. After removing the name and contact information from each nomination, CoinDesk’s editorial board narrowed the candidates to 100 semifinalists. A panel of five judges then reviewed the resulting list of semifinalists, looking for the rare combination of innovation, relevancy and influence. Each judge closely reviewed 20 candidates, providing crucial feedback for the final selection process. Rather than focusing exclusively on technical innovation, the list recognizes that the development of emerging technologies involves multiple types of expertise—from product development and business strategy to regulatory compliance and ethical frameworks. As both Web3 and AI move from experimental phases toward broader adoption, these diverse perspectives become increasingly important. For a fuller explanation of the methodology, please see here. Amodei is an architect of responsible AI development, having co-founded Anthropic in 2021 after her principled departure from OpenAI over safety concerns. Under her leadership, the company has achieved a remarkable $61.5 billion valuation through pioneering "Constitutional AI" methodologies and securing major partnerships with Amazon ($8 billion) and the U.K. government. Amodei's commitment to "igniting a race to the top on safety" positions her as the defining voice in an industry grappling with the balance between innovation and responsibility. Anandkumar has fundamentally transformed scientific computing through her groundbreaking "Neural Operators" framework, which accelerates climate simulations by an astonishing 45,000 times compared to traditional methods. Her vision centers on democratizing complex scientific modeling, making supercomputer-level simulations accessible on consumer hardware to accelerate solutions for global challenges like climate change. Teana Baker-Taylor leverages extensive go-to-market expertise from senior roles at Circle, Crypto.com, and Binance to drive Venice.ai's mission for uncensored, privacy-first AI. The platform has achieved rapid growth to over 930,000 registered users in its first year, demonstrating significant market demand for decentralized AI alternatives. Baker-Taylor's vision extends to shaping AI frameworks that preserve user sovereignty and free speech in an increasingly surveilled digital landscape. As a cancer survivor, Barzilay co-published groundbreaking research in 2020 that used artificial intelligence to detect breast cancer years before traditional diagnoses.

Her influential 2020 paper on using deep learning for antibiotic research has garnered over 2,300 citations on Google Scholar, contributing to her impressive total citation count of more than 43,000. The Mexico-born banking prodigy who became a certified teller at 15 following the 1994 Tequila Crisis has channeled her firsthand experience with financial instability into championing blockchain's potential for economic equality. Her 15-year journey from Citigroup through major BNPL platforms to Hedera's CFO role demonstrates a rare ability to bridge traditional finance with Web3 innovation, particularly in advancing Central Bank Digital Currencies and microfinance solutions. Botaitis embodies Web3's disruptive promise with her audacious vision of creating decentralized systems so efficient that her own CFO role would become obsolete, while Hedera's low-fee network serves financial inclusion initiatives across Africa and beyond. The former French regulator who contributed to the crypto framework that "very largely inspired" the European MiCA Regulation has become an influential voice in institutional digital assets. Cabossioras successfully organized a 600-attendee blockchain conference at the French Ministry of Economy, securing pro-blockchain commitments from government officials and demonstrating her ability to build bridges between regulators and innovators. Societe Generale-Forge, the bank’s digital assets arm, recently signed a deal with BCB Markets to distribute its euro-linked stablecoin EURCV. The Harvard-educated former Binance marketing executive has transformed Trust Wallet into the world's leading self-custody platform, scaling from 40 million to over 200 million users while maintaining strict principles of decentralization and user sovereignty. Chen's 2025 roadmap integrates AI-powered security enhancements and simplified user experiences, positioning Trust Wallet as a "personal companion" that makes Web3 as intuitive as traditional applications while preserving individual control over digital assets. Chen started her career in crypto as a host on Phoenix TV, a Chinese television station. After becoming an early investor in what was then called Bitkeep, Chen became its first managing director, and was then promoted to CEO in May 2024. Since her promotion, Bitget has grown from 20 million users to 120 million. It now conducts more than $2 billion a day with $6.8 billion in assets, making it the sixth largest crypto exchange, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitget also has a $100 million fund to invest in Asian crypto startups. More than half of her managerial team are women. A Harvard Business School graduate, Samara Cohen serves as Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. She has played a key leadership role in the success of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which has rapidly become one of the top-performing Bitcoin ETFs by assets under management. Cohen has publicly emphasized institutional investors’ strong focus on Bitcoin, a stance that continues to influence market dynamics. Her support for asset tokenization underscores BlackRock’s growing commitment to innovation in digital finance. The former LinkedIn VP has scaled Coinbase into a public company achieving incredible revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters of positive EBITDA through strategic operational leadership. Choi's background in traditional tech M&A, combined with her role in Coinbase's NASDAQ listing, exemplifies the professional maturation required for crypto's transition from speculative venture to mainstream financial infrastructure. She continues to be central in shaping Coinbase as a durable, publicly accountable infrastructure provider for digital assets. Head of Policy Europe at Solidus Labs, Delphine Forma has become a figure in crypto compliance education through founding the 2,000-member Crypto Compliance and Legal TG group and hosting influential podcasts like "MiCA Masters." Her extensive background spanning traditional banks like HSBC and crypto pioneers like BitMEX provides crucial bridge-building expertise. Forma's proactive approach to regulatory dialogue and her emphasis on "market integrity" as competitive advantage positions her as a key architect of the institutional-grade compliance infrastructure necessary for mainstream crypto adoption. At Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Pascale Fung leads the Center for AI Research (CAiRE), where she’s been pushing the boundaries of what machines can understand—and feel—for decades. A trailblazer in multilingual voice assistants and emotional AI, Fung has become a key voice for ethical tech in Asia, advising everyone from the United Nations to the Global Partnership on AI. Back in 2001, she helped launch the world’s first Chinese natural language search engine, and in 2017, she introduced an emotionally intelligent speaker that could detect human moods. Today, her research zeroes in on linguistic bias and safety for underrepresented languages. An elected IEEE Fellow, she even met privately with Pope Francis to discuss the moral dimensions of AI. Timnit Gebru is a leading figure in AI ethics, known for her work on algorithmic bias and advocacy for diversity in technology. She co-founded Black in AI to support Black professionals in the field and served as co-lead of Google's Ethical AI team until her controversial departure in 2020 following a dispute over a paper highlighting risks of large language models. In response, she established the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), focusing on community-rooted AI research and challenging prevailing power structures in tech. Gebru's contributions have earned her recognition from Nature and Time as one of the most influential people shaping science and technology. Demi Guo is the co-founder and CEO of Pika Labs, an AI startup specializing in generative video technology. After earning a B.A. in Mathematics and an M.S. in Computer Science from Harvard, she pursued a Ph.D. at Stanford University, focusing on the intersection of natural language processing and graphics, before leaving to launch Pika. In November 2023, Pika raised $55 million from investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, positioning itself as a competitor to OpenAI's video generation models. Guo's vision centers on augmenting creativity through AI, aiming to empower artists rather than replace them. Karen Hao is an award-winning journalist renowned for her incisive reporting on artificial intelligence and its societal impacts. With a background in mechanical engineering from MIT, she transitioned into journalism, serving as a senior AI editor at MIT Technology Review and later as a foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, focusing on AI and technology in China.

Beyond her writing, Hao leads the Pulitzer Center’s AI Spotlight Series, training journalists worldwide to effectively cover AI-related topics. Founder and CEO of Haun Ventures, Kathryn Haun leveraged her unique background as a federal prosecutor who created the government's first cryptocurrency task force into creating her own venture fund. As a former Coinbase board member, Haun continues advocating for balanced regulation that fosters innovation within the United States. Today, Haun is a prominent advocate for thoughtful, innovation-friendly crypto regulation in the U.S., engaging with policymakers to shape frameworks that balance enforcement with entrepreneurial freedom. Her fund backs infrastructure, governance, and consumer-facing crypto projects with a focus on long-term impact. A former leading AI scientist at Alibaba and ByteDance, Professor Yang Hongxia now spearheads groundbreaking research at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). At PolyU, she champions a decentralized approach to AI, developing the "Model-over-Models" paradigm (InfiFusion) to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of large language models. Her innovative work is poised to democratize AI development, bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical applications across various industries, from healthcare to finance. Rising from a researcher to co-executive director at the Ethereum Foundation, Hsiao-Wei Wang has been instrumental in Ethereum's evolution since 2017. Her technical leadership contributed to pivotal projects like the Beacon Chain and The Merge, while her advocacy has amplified Asian developer voices within the global community.

As Fidelity's Chairman and CEO since 2014, Abigail Johnson spearheaded the firm's early entry into the digital asset space, initiating Bitcoin mining exploration, and digital assets research and education in 2014. Under her leadership, Fidelity launched Fidelity Digital Assets in 2019, offering institutional crypto custody and trading services. In January 2024, Fidelity further solidified its crypto market position by introducing a spot Bitcoin ETP, followed by an Ethereum ETP later that year. With Fidelity continuing to file for new blockchain-based funds and explore tokenized finance, Johnson appears poised to shape how traditional finance integrates with decentralized infrastructure. Since becoming CEO in 2020, Johnson has led Franklin Templeton at the forefront of tradfi’s blockchain integration. She oversaw the launch of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, one of the first tokenized money market funds, now available on multiple blockchains including Ethereum and Solana. In 2024, the firm introduced a spot Bitcoin ETF, and in early 2025, filed for a Solana ETF that includes staking features. Johnson envisions a future where all mutual funds and ETFs are tokenized, citing blockchain's efficiency and cost-saving potential. A pioneer in Emotion AI, Rana el Kaliouby co-founded Affectiva as a spin-off from the MIT Media Lab, leading its development of emotion recognition technology. Following the company’s acquisition by Smart Eye in 2021, she became Deputy CEO, contributing to the expansion of driver monitoring systems now deployed in over 1 million vehicles.

In addition to helping the Blockchain Game Alliance spread awareness of web3 gaming around the world, , Kazitani is the co-founder and chief marketing officer of the Numidia Valley Africa Future Club, specifically helping turn Africa into a global leader in web3 gaming. In April, the Algerian Ministry of Strategy and Knowledge and metaverse startup Lamina1 announced a partnership with Numidia Valley to expand North Africa’s work in web3 gaming, sports and entertainment. An alum of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Kazlauskas was already well versed in AI in 2021, when she became one of the pioneers of decentralized AI by co-founding Vana, to help reward people for contributing valuable data to AI models. In April Vana, which lets users pool and govern their data in unions, released a token-standard for digital assets backed by data and the following month announced $25 million in funding from Coinbase Ventures, Paradigm and Polychain. Li is renowned for her pioneering work in artificial intelligence, particularly in computer vision. She spearheaded the creation of ImageNet, a 15-million-image dataset that revolutionized the field. Li served as the Chief Scientist of AI/ML at Google Cloud and now co-directs Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, advocating for ethical and human-centered AI development. Her contributions have earned her the moniker "godmother of AI," reflecting her influence on the discipline's direction. Liu is the president of the Solana Foundation, where she works closely with founders, developers, and institutions to help scale adoption of the Solana network globally. The foundation has given out $100 million in grants to more than 500 projects, helping grow SOL to a $80 billion market value. The McKinsey alum exploded on to the crypto scene in 2015 when she co-founded Earn.com, a way to book meetings with thought leaders in exchange for bitcoin, which was later acquired by Coinbase. Among the earliest TradFi adopters of bitcoin, Long made a huge splash in 2016 when she left Morgan Stanely to join enterprise blockchain startup, Symbiont. After helping craft Wyoming’s trend-setting regulation allowing for state-chartered banks with fully-reserved deposits to hold bitcoin, she founded Custodia Bank to do just that. In 2021, Custodia raised $37 million. In May, Custodia helped a logistics company send payments to Mexico using a stablecoin and is active on social media trying to get U.S. leaders to change the way banks using crypto are regulated. She’s also become an outspoken critic of the way regulators under both the Biden and Trump administration have handed bank access to Federal Reserve accounts. Lo Bessette is the head of Fidelity’s Digital Asset Management division, where she helps manage the company’s strategies for building new kinds of digital asset investments. In January 2024 her team launched one of the first spot Bitcoin ETPs in the U.S., which now has over $18 billion in net assets. A SEC filing from March 2025 indicates Fidelity filed a preliminary registration statement for an on-chain class of its digital treasury fund. Mira Murati, an Albanian-American engineer, has been a pivotal figure in the advancement of artificial intelligence. After earning degrees from Colby College and Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering, she contributed to Tesla's Model X and led product development at Leap Motion. Joining OpenAI in 2018, Murati rose to Chief Technology Officer by 2022, overseeing the development of groundbreaking tools like ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex, and briefly served as interim CEO during a leadership transition. In 2025, she founded Thinking Machines Lab, aiming to create AI systems that are more understandable, customizable, and capable, attracting top talent and significant investment, with the company reportedly valued at over $10 billion. Mitchell is the Chief Ethics Scientist at Hugging Face, an open-source AI software platform that has raised more than $395 million, reportedly at a $4.5 billion valuation. There’s now more than 50,000 organizations using Hugging Face, including Meta, Amazon and Microsoft, and in April, Hugging Face bought open-source firm, Pollen Robotics. Her research has been cited 28,000 times, according to Google Scholar, with more than 50 papers that have been cited 50 times. Not counting papers she wrote using the pen name, Shmargaret Shmitchell, which she says she used for work related to an event. Noble is UCLA’s David O. Sears Presidential Endowed Chair of Social Sciences and Professor of Gender Studies, African American Studies, and Information Studies. In 2018, she published “Algorithms of Oppression,” on algorithmic harm in commercial search engine. That year, her research was cited 200 times, according to Google Scholar, enough to garner her headlines around the world. Her research has only gained in importance. In 2021, the same year she became a MacArthur Foundation Fellow, the paper was cited 1,300 times and last year, more than 1,800 times. Collectively, her work has been cited more than 11,000 times. In June, Meta AI’s former Generative AI Research Director joined U.K. banking giant NatWest Group as its first ever chief AI research officer, serving its 19 million customers.

Passos de Sousa is the founder & CEO of Trexx, a loyalty and engagement platform for the gaming market. In October the São Paulo-based firm launched its Trexx Appchain that rewards gamers for accomplishing certain tasks and is building software that would let borrowers use gaming assets as collateral to take out small loans. Last year they were recognized by the Visa Everywhere Initiative for work exploring how to potentially use gaming assets as a loyalty reward for prepaid cards. After being appointed by President Trump in 2018, Peirce often publicly disagreed with some of her fellow regulator's anti-bitcoin stances. Following Trump’s re-election, she now leads the SEC's Crypto Task Force and is helping change the way the regulator enforces crypto regulations. Following her appointment, she listed ten items the SEC needs to focus on, including clarifying the security status of digital assets, and in May she met with leaders from Fidelity, Nasdaq, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, Apollo, and the DTCC to discuss the shift of traditional assets onto blockchains. As Managing Director, and Head of Technology, Research and Innovation at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Powell is a key figure at a financial infrastructure giant that processed $3.7 quadrillion worth of securities in 2024. After two years as ConsenSys global co-head of NFTs, she now leads the DTCC team responsible for building the DTCC’s Digital Asset Launchpad, building blockchain pilots with a clear path to production. Working in close partnership with every DTCC department she spearheaded DTCC’s AI strategy and policies, most recently, a ChatGPT-like bot helping clients calculate and document risks. Ramos coordinated UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of AI, adopted by 193 countries in 2021. Since then, the recommendation has become the backbone of the Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory, an organization that helps guide international policymakers and regulators, most recently in India and Brazil. The Observatory regularly publishes reports on nations’ preparedness for AI and hosts the Women4Ethical AI working group. Over the course of the nearly four years Ross has been at the helm of the regulator she’s quietly become one of the most influential people in both traditional and crypto markets regulation. In December, her agency published the last documents detailing the application of major new legislation, called Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), designed to clarify what is required of crypto companies doing business in all 27 European nations, including disclosing potential risks to investors. She’s now leading ESMA’s work with the savings and investment union, advocating for her agency to have expanded supervisory powers. Liquid AI raised $250 million in December to help build general purpose AI models. As the director of MIT’s Computer Science & AI Lab (CSAIL), Rus oversees some of the most influential AI thinkers in the world.

Time Published: 2025-06-05T16:35:18Z
Full Content:
At first glance, throwing Web3 and AI into a headline might seem like a bad example of buzzword soup, the practice of media companies trying to game the algorithms (and your attention) by using a bunch of the most-searched words of the day. But CoinDesk has been following the slow integration of applications that track vast amounts of data on a public blockchain and the artificial intelligence capable of making sense of that data for a decade. In the first-ever CoinDesk Top Women in Web3 & AI list, we consulted with a panel of women judges: Julia Bonafede, Co-Founder of investment management firm, Rosetta Analytics; Olivia Bolec, Google’s Enterprise Global Account Director; Sarah Idahosa, Founder of Women in Defi; Saruul Krause-Jentsch, Head of Podcast at Spotify for Central Europe; and Amélie M., Founder and President of the French branch of the Association of Women in Crypto. This list was brought to life through a collaboration between CoinDesk and Proof of Talk, hosted by XVentures. To help ensure the list selection process was as unbiased as possible we sought out multiple, diverse perspectives. An initial public outreach on social media platforms and to our deeply sourced expert analysts, resulted in more than 300 nominations from every geographic region. After removing the name and contact information from each nomination, CoinDesk’s editorial board narrowed the candidates to 100 semifinalists. A panel of five judges then reviewed the resulting list of semifinalists, looking for the rare combination of innovation, relevancy and influence. Each judge closely reviewed 20 candidates, providing crucial feedback for the final selection process. Rather than focusing exclusively on technical innovation, the list recognizes that the development of emerging technologies involves multiple types of expertise—from product development and business strategy to regulatory compliance and ethical frameworks. As both Web3 and AI move from experimental phases toward broader adoption, these diverse perspectives become increasingly important. For a fuller explanation of the methodology, please see here. Amodei is an architect of responsible AI development, having co-founded Anthropic in 2021 after her principled departure from OpenAI over safety concerns. Under her leadership, the company has achieved a remarkable $61.5 billion valuation through pioneering "Constitutional AI" methodologies and securing major partnerships with Amazon ($8 billion) and the U.K. government. Amodei's commitment to "igniting a race to the top on safety" positions her as the defining voice in an industry grappling with the balance between innovation and responsibility. Anandkumar has fundamentally transformed scientific computing through her groundbreaking "Neural Operators" framework, which accelerates climate simulations by an astonishing 45,000 times compared to traditional methods.

Her influential 2020 paper on using deep learning for antibiotic research has garnered over 2,300 citations on Google Scholar, contributing to her impressive total citation count of more than 43,000. The Mexico-born banking prodigy who became a certified teller at 15 following the 1994 Tequila Crisis has channeled her firsthand experience with financial instability into championing blockchain's potential for economic equality. Her 15-year journey from Citigroup through major BNPL platforms to Hedera's CFO role demonstrates a rare ability to bridge traditional finance with Web3 innovation, particularly in advancing Central Bank Digital Currencies and microfinance solutions. Botaitis embodies Web3's disruptive promise with her audacious vision of creating decentralized systems so efficient that her own CFO role would become obsolete, while Hedera's low-fee network serves financial inclusion initiatives across Africa and beyond. The former French regulator who contributed to the crypto framework that "very largely inspired" the European MiCA Regulation has become an influential voice in institutional digital assets. Cabossioras successfully organized a 600-attendee blockchain conference at the French Ministry of Economy, securing pro-blockchain commitments from government officials and demonstrating her ability to build bridges between regulators and innovators. Societe Generale-Forge, the bank’s digital assets arm, recently signed a deal with BCB Markets to distribute its euro-linked stablecoin EURCV. The Harvard-educated former Binance marketing executive has transformed Trust Wallet into the world's leading self-custody platform, scaling from 40 million to over 200 million users while maintaining strict principles of decentralization and user sovereignty. Chen's 2025 roadmap integrates AI-powered security enhancements and simplified user experiences, positioning Trust Wallet as a "personal companion" that makes Web3 as intuitive as traditional applications while preserving individual control over digital assets. Chen started her career in crypto as a host on Phoenix TV, a Chinese television station. After becoming an early investor in what was then called Bitkeep, Chen became its first managing director, and was then promoted to CEO in May 2024. Since her promotion, Bitget has grown from 20 million users to 120 million. It now conducts more than $2 billion a day with $6.8 billion in assets, making it the sixth largest crypto exchange, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitget also has a $100 million fund to invest in Asian crypto startups. More than half of her managerial team are women. A Harvard Business School graduate, Samara Cohen serves as Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. She has played a key leadership role in the success of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which has rapidly become one of the top-performing Bitcoin ETFs by assets under management. Cohen has publicly emphasized institutional investors’ strong focus on Bitcoin, a stance that continues to influence market dynamics. Her support for asset tokenization underscores BlackRock’s growing commitment to innovation in digital finance. The former LinkedIn VP has scaled Coinbase into a public company achieving incredible revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters of positive EBITDA through strategic operational leadership. Choi's background in traditional tech M&A, combined with her role in Coinbase's NASDAQ listing, exemplifies the professional maturation required for crypto's transition from speculative venture to mainstream financial infrastructure. She continues to be central in shaping Coinbase as a durable, publicly accountable infrastructure provider for digital assets. Head of Policy Europe at Solidus Labs, Delphine Forma has become a figure in crypto compliance education through founding the 2,000-member Crypto Compliance and Legal TG group and hosting influential podcasts like "MiCA Masters." Her extensive background spanning traditional banks like HSBC and crypto pioneers like BitMEX provides crucial bridge-building expertise. Forma's proactive approach to regulatory dialogue and her emphasis on "market integrity" as competitive advantage positions her as a key architect of the institutional-grade compliance infrastructure necessary for mainstream crypto adoption. At Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Pascale Fung leads the Center for AI Research (CAiRE), where she’s been pushing the boundaries of what machines can understand—and feel—for decades. A trailblazer in multilingual voice assistants and emotional AI, Fung has become a key voice for ethical tech in Asia, advising everyone from the United Nations to the Global Partnership on AI. Back in 2001, she helped launch the world’s first Chinese natural language search engine, and in 2017, she introduced an emotionally intelligent speaker that could detect human moods. Today, her research zeroes in on linguistic bias and safety for underrepresented languages. An elected IEEE Fellow, she even met privately with Pope Francis to discuss the moral dimensions of AI. Timnit Gebru is a leading figure in AI ethics, known for her work on algorithmic bias and advocacy for diversity in technology. She co-founded Black in AI to support Black professionals in the field and served as co-lead of Google's Ethical AI team until her controversial departure in 2020 following a dispute over a paper highlighting risks of large language models.

By Amanda Bartolotta June 5, 2025 It’s no secret that massive layoffs are currently devastating American workers. While industries across the spectrum are affected, from retail to manufacturing, the hardest-hit area is America’s tech sector, with companies from Amazon to Microsoft to Meta cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs – over 23,400 tech jobs cut in April alone. While automation and AI are conveniently blamed, hardcore reality comes into view when companies routinely cite “cost-cutting” and “corporate restructuring” – phrases that are often euphemisms for laying off American workers while hiring more foreign workers at lower wages. At the same time, the government of India is openly celebrating the launch of its latest scheme to supercharge the export of Indian workers to the U.S. and other “high-income economies.” Its goal is to facilitate the global mobility and employment of millions of migrant Indian workers directly at the expense of jobs for Americans.

Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! India’s “Global Access to Talent from India” initiative, or GATI, launched May 6, was personally championed by India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and other officials who essentially describe it as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redirect jobs, wages and even long-term industry trends away from Americans and into the pockets of India’s government, its outsourcing giants and their international partners. Calling this a “now or never” moment, India warns that the window of demographic advantage could close as competition mounts from African nations, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam and Brazil, all vying for their own share of the global labor market. Referring to a November 2024 think-tank report by two India-based entities, which projects a “global labor gap” of 45-50 million jobs in high-income countries by 2030, GATI sees a huge opportunity to flood foreign markets with its mass population to enter the global workforce. The document outlines a goal of doubling or even tripling the annual outflow of Indian workers, aiming for a “potential stock” of millions of Indian migrant workers overseas. But the ambition doesn’t end there. India is positioning itself as a “geostrategic partner” for major economies, hoping to be recognized as the world’s “trusted migration partner” and rebranding its citizens as a global “talent brand.” GATI predicts this “talent gap” could expand dramatically over the next two decades. Behind this bold new push, India has developed a structured and aggressive multi-horizon strategy to unlock its overseas labor potential. Through a combination of diaspora influence, bilateral negotiations, demand-side positioning, skill alignment and financing mechanisms, India calls for a “whole-of-nation” effort to coordinate the mass movement of workers abroad, treating its citizens as a strategic export. At the same time, Jaishankar demands that destination countries eliminate their own protections and reshape their laws to accommodate this outflow. This is not about mutual benefit, but about using foreign labor markets to solve India’s unemployment and economic growth crises. Outbound movement, remittance inflow Thus, by its own admission, GATI has engineered a massive, state-backed campaign to export Indian labor on a scale never before seen. This isn’t just about creating new job opportunities for Indians, it’s about systematically opening foreign markets, expanding India’s labor supply and building a permanent ecosystem that channels workers – and wages – out of America and into India. According to a leader of one of the report’s contributors, the India-based Boston Consulting Group, India’s labor exports could grow to as many as 2.5 million workers per year. Reality check: This is not a workforce solution for the United States. Indian officials publicly celebrate the higher wages their workers earn overseas, calling it “transformative” for India’s economy, while U.S. companies line up to replace Americans with cheaper, more compliant foreign labor. The result is a hollowing out of America’s middle class, not a win-win for both countries. What’s unfolding in America is not an isolated series of layoffs, but rather a deliberate, top-down overhaul of the U.S. labor market, designed by Indian policymakers, embraced by corporate America and propelled by relentless lobbying for ever more visas. In fact, the GATI Foundation openly targets $300 billion in annual remittances, money siphoned from American paychecks and communities, to be spent and invested back in India. India’s leaders make no secret of their endgame to use public-private partnerships to streamline recruitment, training and job placement for Indian nationals, maximizing remittance flows and strengthening India’s economic influence abroad. These remittance inflows have become a critical pillar of India’s economic strategy, pumping billions back into the country every year. Through GATI, India now aggressively markets itself as the world’s “reliable labor supplier,” positioning outbound migration as a strategic national asset. Unfortunately, the true impact of all this is that every job handed to an Indian guest worker is one lost to an American family. Through the GATI Foundation’s deep network of corporate partners, India is lobbying for looser visa rules and making Indian worker preference the “new normal” in major U.S. industries. Meanwhile, American companies are increasingly outsourcing everything from recruitment to training directly to Indian partners, ensuring that foreign nationals fill key roles while qualified U.S. citizens are left behind. Thus, at its core, the GATI Foundation’s blueprint is not about helping Americans or remedying genuine labor shortages, but about exploiting loopholes in U.S. immigration policy and leveraging global labor narratives to cement India’s rise, at the direct expense of the American workforce. The real agenda behind ‘Global Talent Shortage’ The GATI Foundation was created to exploit what India calls a “demand-supply mismatch” in global labor markets. Citing projections that labor shortages in high-income countries could reach 250 million in 25 years, India pitches itself as the answer, if only Western nations open their doors to millions of Indian workers. The GATI Report frames this supposed crisis as an economic certainty, pushing the narrative that countries like the U.S. and Europe must ramp up labor migration or face disaster. But this narrative falls apart on closer inspection. These “shortage” projections ignore millions of Americans and Westerners who have been forced out of the workforce by layoffs, offshoring and corporate cost-cutting. The “labor gap” is little more than an accounting trick, counting open positions that employers refuse to fill at fair wages and normal working conditions. Instead of investing in local workers, companies push for visas to import cheaper labor. And India stands ready to supply it. The contradiction is glaring: GATI and its supporters claim automation and “Gen AI” are both eliminating jobs and creating labor shortages at the same time. It’s a manufactured crisis, a narrative designed to benefit global corporations and foreign governments, but not American families. In truth, India’s campaign isn’t about filling genuine labor gaps, but about lobbying for new visa categories, higher caps and direct government-to-government deals to force open “mature” markets like the U.S., UK, Canada, Germany and Japan. The GATI Report itself concedes that in these countries, mass inflows are possible only if their governments change laws and visa policies – not because the market demands it, but because India’s lobby demands it. After all, if there truly were a dire worker shortage, existing visa programs would be flooded with qualified applicants and positions would fill quickly. Instead, India is manufacturing demand by lobbying for new pathways and is using its diplomatic muscle to export its unemployment crisis and the “remittance gold rush” that comes with it, into Western economies. As detailed in India’s own 2024 Employment Report, India’s job creation is not keeping pace with its exploding youth population. Far from being a demographic advantage, this so-called dividend is a growing liability, with millions of educated young Indians unable to find work at home. But Jaishankar and the rest of India’s leadership are not merely describing labor trends; they’re demanding permanent, government-backed pipelines to move Indian workers into foreign markets, shifting the costs and consequences onto the United States and its citizens. The so-called “global talent shortage” is not a fact of economics, but a tool of policy – propaganda crafted to dismantle labor protections, depress American wages and entrench the power of foreign governments and multinationals, all at the expense of the American worker. The skills mirage: India’s talent shortage cover-up India promotes its vast, English-speaking workforce as the solution to the so-called global talent shortage, marketing the GATI scheme as a direct pipeline of world-class professionals. In truth, GATI is engineered to move as many people abroad as possible, papering over the persistent problems of quality, skills and employability that continue to plague India’s workforce. Leaders like Jaishankar champion “skill development” and “global mobility,” but India’s own data reveals the reality: Fewer than half of Indian postgraduates are employable by international standards, according to India’s Skill Reports. This isn’t about quality; it’s about numbers. Thus, billions are funneled into crash courses, language bootcamps and certifications, not to build genuine expertise, but to create a façade of qualification, often after jobs have already been promised overseas. Even in crucial sectors like healthcare, where Jaishankar boasts India can “solve” Western shortages, the fact remains: India struggles to meet its own domestic needs. Skill reports and experts like Dr. Lekha Chakraborty confirm that Indian training programs consistently fail to prepare graduates for real-world demands, leaving millions underserved and resources misallocated. Yet, rather than closing the skill gaps at home, the focus is on exporting as many workers as possible, regardless of whether they actually meet international standards. The reality is, India isn’t overflowing with world-class professionals; it’s overflowing with people. Thus, the Indian government’s real objective is to wedge as many Indian nationals as possible into good-paying American jobs, often regardless of true qualification or the local impact. Meanwhile, capable American workers are left behind, not due to a lack of ability, but because U.S. policymakers and corporations have bought into India’s narrative and abandoned investment in the American workforce. The hidden cost of investing in India’s labor-supply strategy India has built a vast financial infrastructure to facilitate outbound migration, offering bridging loans, insurance and rotating funds, all subsidized by public and private grants. For employers, it’s cheaper to bring in Indian nationals than to invest in their own workforce. But the GATI strategy doesn’t stop at financing. India is demanding that host countries overhaul their own labor systems to accommodate and protect incoming foreign workers. Grievance mechanisms, legal mandates and resource centers lock in rights for migrants, while incentives including low-interest business loans and reskilling support are used to tilt hiring toward foreign workers. The hidden costs are staggering. American workers are not only undercut by lower-paid foreign labor, but are forced to compete with a workforce backed by another nation’s government and a web of corporate allies. Meanwhile, U.S. training standards and credential requirements are undermined, eroding the value of American education and experience. This isn’t a temporary fix. It is a permanent, self-reinforcing system, channeling billions of dollars in remittances to India and institutionalizing foreign-worker preference in advanced economies. The outcome is inevitable: falling wages, lost jobs and a steady erosion of America’s sovereignty over its own workforce. Every dollar invested in this supply strategy is a dollar stolen from the American economy. It’s time to demand a course correction, one that puts American skills, livelihoods and interests first. Hiring from India is like signing a contract riddled with hidden clauses; by the time the consequences are clear, the damage is done. The American workforce deserves better. Those jobs belong to American workers, not a foreign government’s export strategy. A blueprint for displacement: India’s cold, calculated framework India’s own analysis admits Indian certifications often aren’t recognized overseas due to mismatched skill requirements and quality standards – a clear sign that many of the workers being pushed abroad are not actually qualified for the jobs at hand. To get around these constraints, India’s plan is to “harmonize demand-centric skilling,” lobbying for international recognition of Indian credentials and pushing for government-backed loans to subsidize outbound migration. The goal isn’t to meet genuine needs, but to bypass local standards and flood foreign markets, regardless of the consequences for host countries. Every time a visa barrier is lowered or a new guest worker program is launched, it opens the door for India to embed even more of its surplus labor in Western economies. But the ambitions don’t stop with white-collar tech jobs. India’s leaders are playing a much longer and more aggressive game, openly targeting blue-collar visa categories like H-2A and H-2B, sectors that have long provided stability for American families and local communities. Their policy documents make this crystal clear: India’s strategy is to steadily lobby for the removal of visa caps, to institutionalize so-called “circular migration” so Indian workers can cycle through U.S. jobs indefinitely and to push for changes in immigration law that make Indian labor the default option for both high- and low-skill roles. This is not a temporary workforce solution; it’s a step-by-step plan to permanently transform the American labor market in ways that serve India’s interests while sidelining American workers at every level. America’s future: At a crossroads Bottom line: As American companies outsource everything from recruitment to onboarding to Indian partners, foreign nationals are funneled into critical roles across tech, healthcare, engineering and more, frequently at the direct expense of U.S. citizens. Accreditation standards are diluted. Worker protections are eroded. The playing field is tilted. India’s GATI initiative does not represent an invitation for partnership; it serves as a stark warning. As Indian leaders openly coordinate, lobby and strategize to gain a foothold in U.S. job markets, too many American officials remain silent or, worse, actively complicit. Every so-called “strategic migration partnership” and each new visa pipeline laid is another brick in the wall separating American families from their own economic future. The stakes could not be higher. This is not a tale of isolated layoffs or routine workforce shifts, but a deliberate, foreign-led transformation of the U.S. labor market. It is sold as progress but experienced as loss in every community facing layoffs, stagnant wages and vanishing careers. Each time an American worker is replaced by a lower-paid Indian “guest worker,” it marks another victory for India’s national agenda and another defeat for the American middle class. Unless action is taken, this pattern will only accelerate. American laws, corporations and policymakers risk becoming tools for India’s economic ascent while the American dream is steadily outsourced and rewritten. Americans must demand that their leaders defend their interests by rejecting foreign lobbying, putting an end to corporate collusion that enables mass visa fraud and restoring a workforce system that prioritizes American citizens in their own country. The choice is clear. Either the United States reclaims its labor market, its laws and its future, or the nation will continue down a path where its greatest export is its own prosperity. History will not be kind to those who allowed this nation to be given away. Now is the time to draw the line: America first, in every job, every industry, and every decision. Otherwise, America’s children will no longer compete with the “world” for the American dream – because that dream will belong to India. Editor’s note: This story is one of the most important currently facing Americans – yet outside of WND, it is almost entirely unreported. For years, WND has warned about the dangers of unchecked immigration and global labor schemes. Now, in real time, Americans are witnessing a foreign government making its final, strategic move to overtake their nation, one visa at a time. WND cannot win this battle alone. With your voice, support and vigilance, we can make sure America’s future is decided by Americans, not by foreign interests.

Title: BlackRock Escapes Texas Oil-Boycott List After ESG Retreat

BlackRock Inc. was removed from Texas’ blacklist of companies that boycott fossil fuels, ending a three-year standoff over the environmental policies of the world’s largest asset manager. The move means pension funds and other state-run investment accounts — which manage more than $300 billion of assets — will be allowed to purchase BlackRock shares, invest in its exchange-traded funds and hire the firm for advice and risk management. Inclusion on the list resulted in some Texas entities pulling billions of dollars of assets from the firm. State Comptroller Glenn Hegar said BlackRock had rolled back many of its green-focused initiatives, including exiting the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and stepping back from the Climate Action 100+, a group devoted to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The move marks a win for BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, who has been courting Texas leaders. Last year, he took the stage with Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick at a summit focused on shoring up the state’s energy grid, and just months ago BlackRock sponsored a table at the Black Tie & Boots Gala, a celebration of conservative politics in Texas. The company is also backing a Dallas-based Texas Stock Exchange. “We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter,” a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement. “BlackRock is proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state. These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.” Hegar touted some of BlackRock’s steps. He said while they are “unrelated” to the listing decision, the actions “show a real commitment to overall policy changes and a desire to act as a trusted partner in the growth of the Texas economy.” The company was a major target for conservative activists for years, with groups taking out advertisements around the country targeting the firm and Fink in particular. They argued the company was trying to influence corporate America and wider society through its support for ESG and sustainable investing. Republican officials in several states joined in that campaign, pulling money from the firm and arguing that it was harming fossil-fuel producing states like Texas. Fink himself said he would no longer use the ESG term because it had been politicized. “We never set out to punish any of these firms, and the hope was always that any firm we included on the list would eventually take steps to ensure they were removed,” Hegar said in a statement. “BlackRock, following the lead of many of its competitors, has finally done exactly that. While it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift, the end results are what matter.” BlackRock and a number of other financial firms including UBS Group AG and BNP Paribas SA were added to Texas’ blacklist n 2022. The action followed a law that restricted business with companies that the state considered to be hostile to the energy industry. Since then, the ESG push at investment firms, pension funds and law practices has faded somewhat, partly because of efforts to avoid attacks by President Donald Trump and Republicans. BlackRock has been seeking to get off the list since it was added. The firm had always maintained it didn’t run afoul of the law. At the time it was included, the company said the decision was “not a fact-based judgment” and detailed investments of more than $100 billion in Texas energy companies. As head of Texas’ finances, Hegar is required to update the list once a year and can do so as often as quarterly. And though his office reviews information on an ongoing basis, removing BlackRock is likely to be one of Hegar’s last actions in the post. The three-term comptroller has been named the next chancellor of the Texas A&M University System after its current leader steps down on June 30.

Title: Seven Days at the Bin Store
URL: https://defector.com/seven-days-at-the-bin-store
Time Published: 2025-06-05T16:07:03Z
Full Content:
9:02 AM EDT on June 4, 2025 This spring, a new business opened on the main drag of my West Philadelphia neighborhood, provoking both excitement and trepidation. “I saw it just the other day and feared it,” one friend texted. “Like what the actual fuck is that shit,” said another. “Why?!!!” said a third. “Who is that for?” Until last summer, the corner storefront at Baltimore Avenue and S. Melville Street was a moderately overpriced hipster vintage store. After it closed, it sat empty for nearly a year. Then, in March, it sprang to life. A “grand opening” banner went up over the door. A miniature wacky inflatable tube man flailed around outside. Posters with the logos for Walmart, Amazon, Costco, and Best Buy covered the windows, declaring “CRAZY DEALS, AMAZING BINZ.” I had to check it out. AMAZING BINZ is on the first floor of a rowhome, narrow and long. There’s one central aisle, and on either side, big wooden tray tables—the proverbial binz—overflowing with undifferentiated piles of consumer stuff: unopened Halloween costumes, an ice mold shaped like a penis, a banner of many glittery penises wearing grass skirts, a staggering number of “reusable hot and cold gel compression sleeve[s] for elbow,” a single loose pregnancy test, something called Wokaar for “waxing the nose beard.” At least half the products are still in boxes, and there are signs on the walls warning customers to NOT OPEN THE BOXES, so you have to scan the barcode with your phone or decipher clipped product descriptions: “module stool,” “gratitude journal,” “Xmas tea light green.” But the great innovation of Amazing Binz is its pricing structure, which is splashed across the facade in Spanish and English and makes good on the promise of CRAZY DEALS. On Fridays, when the bins are freshly stocked, everything costs $10. On Saturdays, $8. Sundays: $6. Mondays: $4. Tuesdays: $2. Wednesdays: $1. Thursday is bin store Sabbath, when the shop is closed and restocked. The store is like nothing else on the block, which boasts, among other things, a yoga studio, two vape shops, a volunteer-run book store and a Marxist reading room, and no fewer than four Ethiopian joints. Where did all this stuff come from? Who opened this store, and why? Is it profitable? What does it mean for the uneven gentrification of Baltimore Avenue and West Philadelphia? I decided to spend a week visiting Amazing Binz every day. Here is what I found. On Thursdays, Amazing Binz is closed. One of the owners, Ahmed, has graciously allowed me to observe the restock. Overall, Ahmed has been very gracious about my fixation on his store. When I arrive at 10:30 a.m., he’s smoking a cigarette and nervously awaiting a delivery truck with 18 pallets of mixed merchandise from Target. Amazing Binz gets its inventory from major corporations’ overstock and returned products, taking advantage of the vast weird world of “reverse logistics.” “ You've got the front end, where you order the product, it comes into the port, it goes to a warehouse, to a store, and then to our front door,” says Cathy Roberson, a researcher at the Reverse Logistics Association, an industry trade group. “What if once it hits our front door, we don't like it, or it's broken or something? That's the reverse part. ” Returns, repairs, refurbished products, and even recalls fall into the purview of reverse logistics. They are joined there by products that never made it to a consumer because the season ended, or a box was a little dented, or the purchaser never picked up their order, or a retailer was just running out of room in their warehouse. That pile of excess stuff is growing. About 17 percent of all merchandise gets returned, according to the National Retail Federation. That’s up from just eight percent in 2019. For online purchases, it’s almost 30 percent. Liquidators are nothing new: T.J. Maxx, Ocean State Job Lot, Nordstrom Rack. But as the scale of the excess grows, the reverse logistics industry is expanding, and methods of disposal are diversifying. Some corporations, like Amazon, do their own reselling through a bulk liquidation page. There are middlemen like B-Stock, an eBay-like site where anyone can shop for truckloads of unwanted stuff. Influencers are buying pallets to unbox on stream, capitalizing on both the goods and the views. It’s a whole universe of brokers, wholesalers, and secondhand retail all trying to claw back a little bit of money from the growing pile. That’s where Amazing Binz comes in. “The goal for all the reverse logistics stuff,” says Roberson, “is to keep things out of the landfill.” Today, Ahmed is expecting half a truckload with about 3,500 to 4,500 individual pieces, ranging from kitchen appliances to toys to clothing; he doesn’t know exactly what. The semi-truck pulls up right on time, and Ahmed unloads it with a forklift, cigarette still in mouth. Pallets fill the sidewalk, glistening shrink-wrapped towers of stuff: air fryers, microwaves, a vacuum, a sled, a machine that tosses a football, My Little Pony-branded diapers, and a go-kart. Inside the store, the bins are still half-full from the last truckload, which came from Amazon. There are many products I’ve only ever seen on the internet: a carrying case and monogrammed straw cover for a Stanley cup, a big plastic grinder for shredding chicken, silicone molds for making the viral Dubai chocolate bar at home. For this restock, Ahmed was hoping for a different caliber of item. It’s a mixed success: some quality products, but more clothing and returned items than he was hoping for. Electronics are the holy grail; appliances and home goods do well, too. The best items are the ones that retain their value, because Ahmed sees his customers as agents in the reverse logistics economy, too. “You can buy stuff from here and then you can resell it,” Ahmed tells me. “Through eBay or Amazon. You can sell on Facebook market. You will get your money back in less than one day if you wanna resell it. Which is a good thing for everybody right now, for the public. A lot of people need to work.” It’s a slog of a day. I leave after a few hours, and come back at 6:00 p.m., nearly eight hours into this operation. Ahmed and two helpers are still unloading and stocking. They won’t be done until after 10:00 p.m. I get to Amazing Binz at 9:35 a.m. It opens at 10:00 a.m. Already, two people are standing at the door with their faces pressed to the glass. Soon, six people are waiting, then a dozen. A woman and her kids show up in a taxi. At least one person has come from the county over. Amazing Binz posts their new hauls on Instagram, so some people have already scouted what they want: a kid’s scooter, a shower caddy. Fridays offer the highest upside: a chance to score something really valuable for just $10. All the real shoppers are lined up this morning, looking for an edge. People are arriving every minute; the line swells to 25. Most of the people waiting are middle-aged black men and women. Some are resellers, and many seem well-versed in Philadelphia’s liquidation economy. A few bring up Turn 7, a giant liquidation warehouse with a bin model that closed last month. I learn about another bin store in New Jersey, and one in Northeast Philly called Black Friday Outlet, a nationwide bin store chain. Someone tells me there’s another bin store opening up today, just 10 blocks away. “When I first got into this industry, there were no more than 10 bin stores in the entire country,” says Nebraska-based wholesaler and content creator Colton Carlson, who opened his first store in 2018. “Fast forward a few years, [and] there ended up being 3,000 bin stores.” Today, he thinks there could be as many as 10,000 in the U.S. Bin stores are distinguished by their pricing model—a set price per item or weight, and falling prices to incentivize quick sales—and by their agnostic approach to inventory. They’ll take nearly anything and everything. “Once people caught on that you could buy a truckload of inventory, you dump it in your bins and you make a ton of money, then they really just started opening that rapid-fire at that point,” says Carlson. The explosion of online returns got the bin-store craze started, but the pandemic put it into overdrive. Factory shutdowns and slowdowns at ports meant for weird lags in the supply chain that led to seasonal products arriving past their season, or goods just being abandoned at port. To try and weather the uncertainty, and keep up with exploding online shopping, retailers overstocked on inventory. “In the beginning of the pandemic, we bought everything in sight,” says Roberson. “Then all of a sudden we, the consumer, decided we've had enough. We've bought everything. We've gotta tighten our belts now.” Consumer spending dropped, and retailers were left holding the bag in overstuffed warehouses. Some, like Target, “ kind of got caught with their pants down,” says Roberson. They were stuck with so much excess inventory, they sold it for pennies on the dollar. The secondhand market flooded with more cheap stuff than normal, creating opportunities for resellers. “On opening day, we had about 300 people lined up down the street,” says Carlson, who thinks his was the biggest bin store in the country at the time. “Every weekend from that, it was just the same thing: a line down the street with 200, 300 people ready to find a deal.” This Friday morning at Amazing Binz, there are now over 30 people waiting to be let inside. Finally, the doors open and the crowd floods into the narrow shop, honing in on the premier items. Scooters and grills and Target-branded home goods fly out of the bins. People are hauling around air fryers so no one else can take them. It is, frankly, a bit of a mad house. One reseller, who didn’t find anything he wanted, says, “One of these days, someone’s going to get shot.” A woman declares, “I will never do this again.” Generally, people seem happy with their finds. The guy who wanted the scooters gets the scooters; the woman who wanted the shower caddy gets the shower caddy. It all happens fast. By the end of the day, the first two bins are completely empty. It’s farmer’s market day in West Philadelphia, Baltimore Avenue’s busiest day. The store is much calmer than Friday morning, but still doing a brisk business. Where yesterday there were piles of home goods and appliances, the bins have been restocked with less high-end fare: soccer balls, bike inner tubes, sand art kits, clothing, shoes. I want to get a sense of how neighbors are feeling. Once, while digging in the bins, I heard a young guy muttering to himself. “This is so weird. What am I looking at?” We made eye contact. “Have you ever seen a store like this?” he asked me. “It doesn’t feel right. I don’t think this will be here long.” I check West Willy, the easily parodied local Facebook group. A post about Amazing Binz has over 50 comments, ranging from “omg I am EXCITED,” to “Maybe I can find things I need and not weep over the price,” to “No offense to the owners but this store feels like where late stage capitalism goes for one final hurrah.” I ask the book vendor who sets up outside the Marxist storefront how he feels about Amazing Binz. “It shows the corporation’s incursion into the neighborhood at every level, big to small,” he says. He adds that he likes that it’s a minority-owned business. I ask a resident who happens to be walking by, a long-timer who moved to the neighborhood in the 1970s when it was, as he says, Philadelphia’s answer to Haight-Ashbury. “It means a potential downturn of the local market that had been popping up with restaurants and boutiques,” he says. Baltimore Avenue runs from the University of Pennsylvania campus in the east, west through a neighborhood that’s a mixture of million-dollar houses, squats-turned-group-houses, and some of the city’s most persistent poverty. For the six-ish years I’ve lived here, I’ve watched a handful of bougie businesses open and quickly fold, leaving behind empty storefronts. Housing prices just go up and up, but the retail strip suggests an uneven gentrification. Those fluctuating fortunes are mirrored in starkly divergent views of whether Amazing Binz is an “amazing store with amazing stuff and amazing prices” (their first Google review) or “a place that sells crap” (a post on West Willy). It’s an odd location for a store like this. Liquidators usually look for huge spaces, in industrial areas or big shopping centers at the edge of town. When I ask Ahmed how he came to open Amazing Binz here, he said it was actually not his first choice. He wanted to open a cafe or a sweet shop, but says he couldn’t get the permits or the zoning. The landlord wouldn’t give him a break on rent, which is nearly $4,000 a month. So after about eight months of sitting on the location, Ahmed decided he needed to open something with low overhead and little startup capital. There’s a few bin stores in Northeast Philly, where he lives, so he’d seen this model before, and thought it would be good for the neighborhood. At the start of this week, he hung a Free Palestine flag behind the counter. He’s from the West Bank and felt comfortable hanging the flag because, he says, “Our neighbors support us.” Nearly every time I’m here, there are happy customers, usually quite a few. There's a real mix of the neighborhood. Serious diggers, often in headphones, methodically overturn every pile. A PTA mom sends her husband home for the car after she fills three baskets with school supplies. Some gigglers revel in the slop and the strangely sentimental: the Dick Pics in Nature calendar, the crystal heart paperweight engraved with a 25th wedding anniversary message. But there are haters. At parties and potlucks across West Philadelphia, my neighbors split into camps: for or against the bin store. Houses divide against themselves. Pros: It’s cheap, it’s fun, and at least the stuff isn’t getting thrown away. Cons: An uncanny feeling of glimpsing the collective consumer psyche, AI slop in consumer form, the horrors of production for production’s sake. At the farmer’s market, a friend of a friend calls Amazing Binz “dark and sinister,” and compares it to a big sifting funnel. All the consumer drivel of the world goes in at the top, and all the unsaleable, undigested, unwanted stuff just falls out the bottom. “The bin store,” he says, “is like the last step before they just throw it in the ocean.” When I get to Amazing Binz, Omran—Amazing Binz’s social media hype man—is filming a video with a shopper who found the toner she usually buys at Sephora, for $65, here in the bins for $6. This is one of Omran’s Instagram shticks. He asks customers what they bought and how much they paid, and then replies, “I know daht’s right,” a phrase also tagged on all the posts. Omran does some of the ordering for Amazing Binz. He says he buys his inventory through direct relationships with people at warehouses, not through auction sites, where the prices are often higher. Ahmed tells me the average truckload costs about $16,000, and will contain thousands of individual pieces. The key is to keep the cost per item at around $2, and to get a mix of higher- and lower-value items so they balance each other out. Most bin stores do a hybrid model, where they sell higher-quality stuff on the side at prices above $10. Amazing Binz calls it the VIP section. With this week’s Target haul, I assumed that the nicer items would end up there. But no, the owners priced most of it at $10, hoping the allure of a huge discount on a big-ticket item draws people in and gets them to spend more. This is the bin-store promise: teasing the chance to find Oura rings and AirPods for just $10. Once, while I talked to Ahmed, a neighbor walked by and waved. “She got those Beats headphones here,” he says. “Ten dollars. She was so happy.” But the price flattening works in both directions, I realize on a $6 Sunday. A friend is shopping for a mermaid-themed bachelorette party, and we find plenty: That previously mentioned garland of penises is still here (two, actually), as well as a sheet of mermaid stickers and a curly straw that spells "BRIDE." The problem is that $6 is too expensive for a straw, especially a straw that I know has been here for three weeks, at least. This is one effect of the bin store: There’s plenty of legitimately good stuff, at good prices, but that usually gets snapped up in the first few days. Anything that remains through the whole pricing cycle and back again is revealed to be worth nothing at all. My friend, digging for penis straws, says maybe it’s good to see. We have to confront this stuff. This is the cost of our collective Amazon addiction. There are times when the bin store does feel like an art installation, a message, or a warning. Wander through it for a few days and you will start to feel like you are in a room in a haunted house, one where the corporeal forms of the world economy’s least-wanted products are trapped, unable to move on. With or without Amazing Binz, all of this stuff is just out there, already made. A lot of it is useful but excessive, rendered obsolete by an overheated economy. Shopping here can feel a bit like fighting the last, losing battle of reverse logistics. What can still be made useful enough to be kept out of the landfill, just a little longer? It’s a slow day at Amazing Binz, again. This week has been big on gloomy weather, and low on foot traffic. I find a Trump 2024 Punisher logo drink koozie in the pile. These have been popping up in the bins since that first Amazon haul, along with MAGA and Let’s Go Brandon flags. Every time a customer points one out to the owners, they throw it away. A woman approaches the counter with a pair of leopard-print flats, but the two shoes are connected by a stretchy white loop of elastic that’s gotten tangled up with at least five other pairs’ elastic, creating an unholy rats nest of shoes that she needs help untangling. On slower days, it’s hard not to wonder how long Amazing Binz will last. Philadelphia may be behind the times. In the rest of the country, the bin-store bubble has started to burst. On YouTube, I find a cadre of wholesale and reselling influencers, including a bin-store niche. I watch their videos touting the model, how easy it is to start one, and how to succeed. Then I watch them change their tunes. “Unpopular opinion: Bin stores really suck right now,” declared creator Lindey Glenn in November 2023. She linked to Carlson’s most recent video: “Bin store burnout.” After opening his first store in late 2018, Carlson had a few good years riding high on the novelty of the business model and the glut of unwanted pandemic-era merchandise. But as more bin stores opened, the demand and prices for the same truckloads went up. Colton says that after a while, he was just breaking even on the bins, which at his store, started at a high of only $5. He found other revenue streams, like selling entire pallets to resellers, and sorting out the niche and expensive products to flip on Poshmark or eBay. But the challenges persisted. The bin store is a finely tuned operation. A broker might promise a great haul with new electronics, and then deliver a bunch of dirty and broken returns. A truckload could arrive late, or not at all, leaving owners in the lurch on what should be their most profitable day. These problems are exacerbated in small stores, like Amazing Binz, where it’s hard to store extra merchandise to weather that uncertainty. And the stuff itself creates logistical headaches. Boxes get opened, sometimes from theft, sometimes just from jostling around in the bins. Pieces get lost, trash and detritus build up alongside the unsold products, the difference between them increasingly hard to discern. In fact, when it was time to clear his bins, Carlton would dump all of the unsold inventory mixed with trash back onto a pallet and sell the whole thing for $50, with the caveat that the buyer had to go toss the garbage somewhere else. Carlson saw the writing on the wall. He sold his bin store in 2023. Now he’s focusing on his wholesale business, and opening a side-by-side discount grocery and clothing store, which is where he thinks the secondhand retail trends are headed. The Reverse Logistics Association has also seen a decline in bin-store fortunes. Roberson says they lost a few bin-store members because of bankruptcy. After the pandemic, “it was getting more difficult to buy up that excess inventory because there really wasn't excess inventory.” But economic shocks are good for the secondhand economy. Roberson thinks tariffs could, eventually, lead to another bin-store bump. At the start of 2025, she says, many retailers overstocked on inventory again, filling their warehouses to get ahead of price hikes. That could mean they’ll soon be sitting on overstock, especially if consumers decide they’re not willing to pay higher prices. Supply chain disruptions will produce more excess. Already, goods are stalled at ports around the world. Roberson predicts a temporary dip in the fortunes of bin-store owners, as secondhand goods get more expensive along with everything else, and then a resurgence. Carlson agrees. “ I think the secondhand market is going to keep growing because that's the whole reason people are shopping at these stores [to see] if they can save $10. I don't see consumer spending going down for this industry, or even like thrift stores at all. I think that's gonna continuously go up. However, the problem's gonna lie on whoever owns the bin store.” Ahmed seems extremely tired today. He’s barely taken a day off since they opened, not even for Eid. Everything is pretty picked over. The sand art is all gone, the bedding and curtains. There’s just two soccer balls left. I do my customary scan of the bins, from the back of the store to the front. There’s nothing new, just increasingly empty boxes of gel compression elbow sleeves, loose whippit canisters, and batteries rolling across the bottom. According to Ahmed, the cost of pallets is going up. On a recent load of electronics, he paid $12 per item. For the time being, Amazing Binz is just breaking even, but it’s not sustainable. Ahmed says he may have to raise prices, and that he’ll even have to reevaluate the whole business in a few months. “This type of business, it’s not for this neighborhood,” he says. Omran, ever the salesman, is darkly optimistic that they can keep prices low. "Anything to save the community some money,” he says. "We're not looking to get rich. Being rich is pointless nowadays. It's about, how can you survive? How can I feed my kids? How can we pay our bills?” I’m reminded of a conversation I had with the truck driver, Nick, who dropped off the Target load. He used to drive a taxi, until Uber ruined that. He prefers truck driving, but it was better at the height of the pandemic, when everyone was shopping online. Around that time, Nick’s wife was a third-party seller on Amazon. She stocked her inventory based on social media trends, a task complicated by the algorithm. The more she looked at videos of, say, people showing off their Stanley cup accessories, the more TikTok fed her those videos, until it was hard to know if people were actually buying them in the real world, or if she was just in an online feedback loop. Plus, Amazon charges high storage fees, so unsold product just sitting in their warehouse cost her money. She quit, and abandoned her merchandise. That’s where a lot of the stuff in the Amazing Binz came from: failing third-party vendors, looking to offload the detritus of brief and bygone trends. For a second, an image of the 21st century economy seems to come into focus here at the bin store. Nick, his wife, Amazing Binz’s owners, and even me, a freelance journalist, we’re all supposedly free agents, “entrepreneurs,” but in reality, we’re limited to buying whatever gets kicked down the funnel, and flipping it for all it’s worth. It’s like I can see our labor getting discounted by the day. Already, I've asked my editor if I can resell a version of this story elsewhere, to recoup a little more of my Amazing Binz investment. At 6:45 p.m. on Wednesday, a little over an hour until closing time, the shop is packed. Everything is now one dollar. An elderly woman finds a shoe she likes, a black slide with gold studs all over. But it's just one shoe. Ahmed is insisting she buy it, and says he’ll keep the other shoe for her when he finds it. “For a dollar you can’t beat it,” he says. He’s in a good mood, joking with this woman and her daughter. She’s apparently been looking for three days. “Those shoes are really cute,” I tell her. “Do you work here?” she asks. Maybe I’ve been here too long. After days of finding empty boxes, I finally find a loose elbow gel sleeve. It is heavy, slinky, comforting. After this, I find many of them, hiding in the bins like eels. Everything swims around the piles, and I revisit them as old friends, including the unopened boxes, known only by their clipped epithets: “Kiss Me I’m Irish wooden sign with lights,” “Lazy Susan for Refrigerator New.” The Jujube Enucleator box is full one day, and empty the next, without me ever seeing what was inside. The Dick Pics in Nature calendar remains, week after week. Who knows how many times these items have been bought and sold before they arrived here, how many more times they might be bought and sold. I imagine it all ending up in the same places eventually: the landfill or the waterways, where it will exist forever, first as choking hazard, then as nurdle. In the dwindling bins, I find another Trump flag, folded in plastic but unmistakable. Omran says I can have it. I unfurl it, stiff and plasticky, creased into a grid. I don’t want it, but what am I supposed to do? It will end up in the garbage one way or another. I stuff it in my bag. I ask, “How long have you guys been open?” It’s April 16, and Omran says they opened the doors on March 21. “I thought it was more than a month,” says Ahmed. “It’s been a long month,” says Omran. The Trump flag joins a small museum of items I have purchased since the bin store opened: a cat bed ($10), a felted flower garland ($6), four post-Valentine heart-shaped chocolate boxes ($5 for all), two small spring-form pans ($4 each), a large penis-shaped ice cube mold ($4), four bike inner tubes ($2 each), a box of ant traps that don’t work ($2). Did I need any of these things? Maybe the ant traps, if they’d worked, maybe the inner tubes. Mostly, I bought them because they were there, the same way I watch an Instagram reel because it pops up next. The irony is that if I were in the market for new pans or bedding, Amazing Binz would at this point be my best local option. It’s also simultaneously the most fun and most unsettling store on Baltimore Avenue, a combination that I find addictive, as many bin enjoyers do. I take one last lap, back into the farthest corner of the store, where the oldest stuff has accumulated in deep drifts, where the Wokaar lives, now separated from its box. Looking for what? I don’t know. It’s concentrated back here, layers of unwanted product, filtered all the way down the supply chain to this last bin, where it’s piling up like sand. As I stare at the piles, I almost expect them to start breaking down in front of me, each individual item decomposing into a pool of microplastics, what remains of its value finally depleted. I leave the store, and the bins where they are. They’ll be full again tomorrow. If you liked this blog, please share it!

Title: Seven Days at the Bin Store

Full Content:
9:02 AM EDT on June 4, 2025 This spring, a new business opened on the main drag of my West Philadelphia neighborhood, provoking both excitement and trepidation. “I saw it just the other day and feared it,” one friend texted. “Like what the actual fuck is that shit,” said another. “Why?!!!” said a third. “Who is that for?” Until last summer, the corner storefront at Baltimore Avenue and S. Melville Street was a moderately overpriced hipster vintage store. After it closed, it sat empty for nearly a year. Then, in March, it sprang to life. A “grand opening” banner went up over the door. A miniature wacky inflatable tube man flailed around outside. Posters with the logos for Walmart, Amazon, Costco, and Best Buy covered the windows, declaring “CRAZY DEALS, AMAZING BINZ.” I had to check it out. AMAZING BINZ is on the first floor of a rowhome, narrow and long. There’s one central aisle, and on either side, big wooden tray tables—the proverbial binz—overflowing with undifferentiated piles of consumer stuff: unopened Halloween costumes, an ice mold shaped like a penis, a banner of many glittery penises wearing grass skirts, a staggering number of “reusable hot and cold gel compression sleeve[s] for elbow,” a single loose pregnancy test, something called Wokaar for “waxing the nose beard.” At least half the products are still in boxes, and there are signs on the walls warning customers to NOT OPEN THE BOXES, so you have to scan the barcode with your phone or decipher clipped product descriptions: “module stool,” “gratitude journal,” “Xmas tea light green.” But the great innovation of Amazing Binz is its pricing structure, which is splashed across the facade in Spanish and English and makes good on the promise of CRAZY DEALS. On Fridays, when the bins are freshly stocked, everything costs $10. On Saturdays, $8. Sundays: $6. Mondays: $4. Tuesdays: $2. Wednesdays: $1. Thursday is bin store Sabbath, when the shop is closed and restocked. The store is like nothing else on the block, which boasts, among other things, a yoga studio, two vape shops, a volunteer-run book store and a Marxist reading room, and no fewer than four Ethiopian joints. Where did all this stuff come from? Who opened this store, and why? Is it profitable? What does it mean for the uneven gentrification of Baltimore Avenue and West Philadelphia? I decided to spend a week visiting Amazing Binz every day. Here is what I found. On Thursdays, Amazing Binz is closed. One of the owners, Ahmed, has graciously allowed me to observe the restock. Overall, Ahmed has been very gracious about my fixation on his store. When I arrive at 10:30 a.m., he’s smoking a cigarette and nervously awaiting a delivery truck with 18 pallets of mixed merchandise from Target. Amazing Binz gets its inventory from major corporations’ overstock and returned products, taking advantage of the vast weird world of “reverse logistics.” “ You've got the front end, where you order the product, it comes into the port, it goes to a warehouse, to a store, and then to our front door,” says Cathy Roberson, a researcher at the Reverse Logistics Association, an industry trade group. “What if once it hits our front door, we don't like it, or it's broken or something? That's the reverse part. ” Returns, repairs, refurbished products, and even recalls fall into the purview of reverse logistics. They are joined there by products that never made it to a consumer because the season ended, or a box was a little dented, or the purchaser never picked up their order, or a retailer was just running out of room in their warehouse. That pile of excess stuff is growing. About 17 percent of all merchandise gets returned, according to the National Retail Federation. That’s up from just eight percent in 2019. For online purchases, it’s almost 30 percent. Liquidators are nothing new: T.J. Maxx, Ocean State Job Lot, Nordstrom Rack. But as the scale of the excess grows, the reverse logistics industry is expanding, and methods of disposal are diversifying. Some corporations, like Amazon, do their own reselling through a bulk liquidation page. There are middlemen like B-Stock, an eBay-like site where anyone can shop for truckloads of unwanted stuff. Influencers are buying pallets to unbox on stream, capitalizing on both the goods and the views. It’s a whole universe of brokers, wholesalers, and secondhand retail all trying to claw back a little bit of money from the growing pile. That’s where Amazing Binz comes in. “The goal for all the reverse logistics stuff,” says Roberson, “is to keep things out of the landfill.” Today, Ahmed is expecting half a truckload with about 3,500 to 4,500 individual pieces, ranging from kitchen appliances to toys to clothing; he doesn’t know exactly what. The semi-truck pulls up right on time, and Ahmed unloads it with a forklift, cigarette still in mouth. Pallets fill the sidewalk, glistening shrink-wrapped towers of stuff: air fryers, microwaves, a vacuum, a sled, a machine that tosses a football, My Little Pony-branded diapers, and a go-kart. Inside the store, the bins are still half-full from the last truckload, which came from Amazon. There are many products I’ve only ever seen on the internet: a carrying case and monogrammed straw cover for a Stanley cup, a big plastic grinder for shredding chicken, silicone molds for making the viral Dubai chocolate bar at home. For this restock, Ahmed was hoping for a different caliber of item. It’s a mixed success: some quality products, but more clothing and returned items than he was hoping for. Electronics are the holy grail; appliances and home goods do well, too. The best items are the ones that retain their value, because Ahmed sees his customers as agents in the reverse logistics economy, too. “You can buy stuff from here and then you can resell it,” Ahmed tells me. “Through eBay or Amazon. You can sell on Facebook market. You will get your money back in less than one day if you wanna resell it. Which is a good thing for everybody right now, for the public. A lot of people need to work.” It’s a slog of a day. I leave after a few hours, and come back at 6:00 p.m., nearly eight hours into this operation. Ahmed and two helpers are still unloading and stocking. They won’t be done until after 10:00 p.m. I get to Amazing Binz at 9:35 a.m. It opens at 10:00 a.m. Already, two people are standing at the door with their faces pressed to the glass. Soon, six people are waiting, then a dozen. A woman and her kids show up in a taxi. At least one person has come from the county over. Amazing Binz posts their new hauls on Instagram, so some people have already scouted what they want: a kid’s scooter, a shower caddy. Fridays offer the highest upside: a chance to score something really valuable for just $10. All the real shoppers are lined up this morning, looking for an edge. People are arriving every minute; the line swells to 25. Most of the people waiting are middle-aged black men and women. Some are resellers, and many seem well-versed in Philadelphia’s liquidation economy. A few bring up Turn 7, a giant liquidation warehouse with a bin model that closed last month. I learn about another bin store in New Jersey, and one in Northeast Philly called Black Friday Outlet, a nationwide bin store chain. Someone tells me there’s another bin store opening up today, just 10 blocks away. “When I first got into this industry, there were no more than 10 bin stores in the entire country,” says Nebraska-based wholesaler and content creator Colton Carlson, who opened his first store in 2018. “Fast forward a few years, [and] there ended up being 3,000 bin stores.” Today, he thinks there could be as many as 10,000 in the U.S. Bin stores are distinguished by their pricing model—a set price per item or weight, and falling prices to incentivize quick sales—and by their agnostic approach to inventory. They’ll take nearly anything and everything. “Once people caught on that you could buy a truckload of inventory, you dump it in your bins and you make a ton of money, then they really just started opening that rapid-fire at that point,” says Carlson. The explosion of online returns got the bin-store craze started, but the pandemic put it into overdrive. Factory shutdowns and slowdowns at ports meant for weird lags in the supply chain that led to seasonal products arriving past their season, or goods just being abandoned at port. To try and weather the uncertainty, and keep up with exploding online shopping, retailers overstocked on inventory. “In the beginning of the pandemic, we bought everything in sight,” says Roberson. “Then all of a sudden we, the consumer, decided we've had enough. We've bought everything. We've gotta tighten our belts now.” Consumer spending dropped, and retailers were left holding the bag in overstuffed warehouses. Some, like Target, “ kind of got caught with their pants down,” says Roberson. They were stuck with so much excess inventory, they sold it for pennies on the dollar. The secondhand market flooded with more cheap stuff than normal, creating opportunities for resellers. “On opening day, we had about 300 people lined up down the street,” says Carlson, who thinks his was the biggest bin store in the country at the time. “Every weekend from that, it was just the same thing: a line down the street with 200, 300 people ready to find a deal.” This Friday morning at Amazing Binz, there are now over 30 people waiting to be let inside. Finally, the doors open and the crowd floods into the narrow shop, honing in on the premier items. Scooters and grills and Target-branded home goods fly out of the bins. People are hauling around air fryers so no one else can take them. It is, frankly, a bit of a mad house. One reseller, who didn’t find anything he wanted, says, “One of these days, someone’s going to get shot.” A woman declares, “I will never do this again.” Generally, people seem happy with their finds. The guy who wanted the scooters gets the scooters; the woman who wanted the shower caddy gets the shower caddy. It all happens fast. By the end of the day, the first two bins are completely empty. It’s farmer’s market day in West Philadelphia, Baltimore Avenue’s busiest day. The store is much calmer than Friday morning, but still doing a brisk business. Where yesterday there were piles of home goods and appliances, the bins have been restocked with less high-end fare: soccer balls, bike inner tubes, sand art kits, clothing, shoes. I want to get a sense of how neighbors are feeling. Once, while digging in the bins, I heard a young guy muttering to himself. “This is so weird. What am I looking at?” We made eye contact. “Have you ever seen a store like this?” he asked me. “It doesn’t feel right. I don’t think this will be here long.” I check West Willy, the easily parodied local Facebook group. A post about Amazing Binz has over 50 comments, ranging from “omg I am EXCITED,” to “Maybe I can find things I need and not weep over the price,” to “No offense to the owners but this store feels like where late stage capitalism goes for one final hurrah.” I ask the book vendor who sets up outside the Marxist storefront how he feels about Amazing Binz. “It shows the corporation’s incursion into the neighborhood at every level, big to small,” he says. He adds that he likes that it’s a minority-owned business. I ask a resident who happens to be walking by, a long-timer who moved to the neighborhood in the 1970s when it was, as he says, Philadelphia’s answer to Haight-Ashbury. “It means a potential downturn of the local market that had been popping up with restaurants and boutiques,” he says. Baltimore Avenue runs from the University of Pennsylvania campus in the east, west through a neighborhood that’s a mixture of million-dollar houses, squats-turned-group-houses, and some of the city’s most persistent poverty. For the six-ish years I’ve lived here, I’ve watched a handful of bougie businesses open and quickly fold, leaving behind empty storefronts. Housing prices just go up and up, but the retail strip suggests an uneven gentrification. Those fluctuating fortunes are mirrored in starkly divergent views of whether Amazing Binz is an “amazing store with amazing stuff and amazing prices” (their first Google review) or “a place that sells crap” (a post on West Willy). It’s an odd location for a store like this. Liquidators usually look for huge spaces, in industrial areas or big shopping centers at the edge of town. When I ask Ahmed how he came to open Amazing Binz here, he said it was actually not his first choice. He wanted to open a cafe or a sweet shop, but says he couldn’t get the permits or the zoning. The landlord wouldn’t give him a break on rent, which is nearly $4,000 a month. So after about eight months of sitting on the location, Ahmed decided he needed to open something with low overhead and little startup capital. There’s a few bin stores in Northeast Philly, where he lives, so he’d seen this model before, and thought it would be good for the neighborhood. At the start of this week, he hung a Free Palestine flag behind the counter. He’s from the West Bank and felt comfortable hanging the flag because, he says, “Our neighbors support us.” Nearly every time I’m here, there are happy customers, usually quite a few. There's a real mix of the neighborhood. Serious diggers, often in headphones, methodically overturn every pile. A PTA mom sends her husband home for the car after she fills three baskets with school supplies. Some gigglers revel in the slop and the strangely sentimental: the Dick Pics in Nature calendar, the crystal heart paperweight engraved with a 25th wedding anniversary message. But there are haters. At parties and potlucks across West Philadelphia, my neighbors split into camps: for or against the bin store. Houses divide against themselves. Pros: It’s cheap, it’s fun, and at least the stuff isn’t getting thrown away. Cons: An uncanny feeling of glimpsing the collective consumer psyche, AI slop in consumer form, the horrors of production for production’s sake. At the farmer’s market, a friend of a friend calls Amazing Binz “dark and sinister,” and compares it to a big sifting funnel. All the consumer drivel of the world goes in at the top, and all the unsaleable, undigested, unwanted stuff just falls out the bottom. “The bin store,” he says, “is like the last step before they just throw it in the ocean.” When I get to Amazing Binz, Omran—Amazing Binz’s social media hype man—is filming a video with a shopper who found the toner she usually buys at Sephora, for $65, here in the bins for $6. This is one of Omran’s Instagram shticks. He asks customers what they bought and how much they paid, and then replies, “I know daht’s right,” a phrase also tagged on all the posts. Omran does some of the ordering for Amazing Binz. He says he buys his inventory through direct relationships with people at warehouses, not through auction sites, where the prices are often higher. Ahmed tells me the average truckload costs about $16,000, and will contain thousands of individual pieces. The key is to keep the cost per item at around $2, and to get a mix of higher- and lower-value items so they balance each other out. Most bin stores do a hybrid model, where they sell higher-quality stuff on the side at prices above $10. Amazing Binz calls it the VIP section. With this week’s Target haul, I assumed that the nicer items would end up there. But no, the owners priced most of it at $10, hoping the allure of a huge discount on a big-ticket item draws people in and gets them to spend more. This is the bin-store promise: teasing the chance to find Oura rings and AirPods for just $10. Once, while I talked to Ahmed, a neighbor walked by and waved. “She got those Beats headphones here,” he says. “Ten dollars. She was so happy.” But the price flattening works in both directions, I realize on a $6 Sunday. A friend is shopping for a mermaid-themed bachelorette party, and we find plenty: That previously mentioned garland of penises is still here (two, actually), as well as a sheet of mermaid stickers and a curly straw that spells "BRIDE." The problem is that $6 is too expensive for a straw, especially a straw that I know has been here for three weeks, at least. This is one effect of the bin store: There’s plenty of legitimately good stuff, at good prices, but that usually gets snapped up in the first few days. Anything that remains through the whole pricing cycle and back again is revealed to be worth nothing at all. My friend, digging for penis straws, says maybe it’s good to see. We have to confront this stuff. This is the cost of our collective Amazon addiction. There are times when the bin store does feel like an art installation, a message, or a warning. Wander through it for a few days and you will start to feel like you are in a room in a haunted house, one where the corporeal forms of the world economy’s least-wanted products are trapped, unable to move on. With or without Amazing Binz, all of this stuff is just out there, already made. A lot of it is useful but excessive, rendered obsolete by an overheated economy. Shopping here can feel a bit like fighting the last, losing battle of reverse logistics. What can still be made useful enough to be kept out of the landfill, just a little longer? It’s a slow day at Amazing Binz, again. This week has been big on gloomy weather, and low on foot traffic. I find a Trump 2024 Punisher logo drink koozie in the pile. These have been popping up in the bins since that first Amazon haul, along with MAGA and Let’s Go Brandon flags. Every time a customer points one out to the owners, they throw it away. A woman approaches the counter with a pair of leopard-print flats, but the two shoes are connected by a stretchy white loop of elastic that’s gotten tangled up with at least five other pairs’ elastic, creating an unholy rats nest of shoes that she needs help untangling. On slower days, it’s hard not to wonder how long Amazing Binz will last. Philadelphia may be behind the times. In the rest of the country, the bin-store bubble has started to burst. On YouTube, I find a cadre of wholesale and reselling influencers, including a bin-store niche. I watch their videos touting the model, how easy it is to start one, and how to succeed. Then I watch them change their tunes. “Unpopular opinion: Bin stores really suck right now,” declared creator Lindey Glenn in November 2023. She linked to Carlson’s most recent video: “Bin store burnout.” After opening his first store in late 2018, Carlson had a few good years riding high on the novelty of the business model and the glut of unwanted pandemic-era merchandise. But as more bin stores opened, the demand and prices for the same truckloads went up. Colton says that after a while, he was just breaking even on the bins, which at his store, started at a high of only $5. He found other revenue streams, like selling entire pallets to resellers, and sorting out the niche and expensive products to flip on Poshmark or eBay. But the challenges persisted. The bin store is a finely tuned operation. A broker might promise a great haul with new electronics, and then deliver a bunch of dirty and broken returns. A truckload could arrive late, or not at all, leaving owners in the lurch on what should be their most profitable day. These problems are exacerbated in small stores, like Amazing Binz, where it’s hard to store extra merchandise to weather that uncertainty. And the stuff itself creates logistical headaches. Boxes get opened, sometimes from theft, sometimes just from jostling around in the bins. Pieces get lost, trash and detritus build up alongside the unsold products, the difference between them increasingly hard to discern. In fact, when it was time to clear his bins, Carlton would dump all of the unsold inventory mixed with trash back onto a pallet and sell the whole thing for $50, with the caveat that the buyer had to go toss the garbage somewhere else. Carlson saw the writing on the wall. He sold his bin store in 2023. Now he’s focusing on his wholesale business, and opening a side-by-side discount grocery and clothing store, which is where he thinks the secondhand retail trends are headed. The Reverse Logistics Association has also seen a decline in bin-store fortunes. Roberson says they lost a few bin-store members because of bankruptcy. After the pandemic, “it was getting more difficult to buy up that excess inventory because there really wasn't excess inventory.” But economic shocks are good for the secondhand economy. Roberson thinks tariffs could, eventually, lead to another bin-store bump. At the start of 2025, she says, many retailers overstocked on inventory again, filling their warehouses to get ahead of price hikes. That could mean they’ll soon be sitting on overstock, especially if consumers decide they’re not willing to pay higher prices. Supply chain disruptions will produce more excess. Already, goods are stalled at ports around the world. Roberson predicts a temporary dip in the fortunes of bin-store owners, as secondhand goods get more expensive along with everything else, and then a resurgence. Carlson agrees. “ I think the secondhand market is going to keep growing because that's the whole reason people are shopping at these stores [to see] if they can save $10. I don't see consumer spending going down for this industry, or even like thrift stores at all. I think that's gonna continuously go up. However, the problem's gonna lie on whoever owns the bin store.” Ahmed seems extremely tired today. He’s barely taken a day off since they opened, not even for Eid. Everything is pretty picked over. The sand art is all gone, the bedding and curtains. There’s just two soccer balls left. I do my customary scan of the bins, from the back of the store to the front. There’s nothing new, just increasingly empty boxes of gel compression elbow sleeves, loose whippit canisters, and batteries rolling across the bottom. According to Ahmed, the cost of pallets is going up. On a recent load of electronics, he paid $12 per item. For the time being, Amazing Binz is just breaking even, but it’s not sustainable. Ahmed says he may have to raise prices, and that he’ll even have to reevaluate the whole business in a few months. “This type of business, it’s not for this neighborhood,” he says. Omran, ever the salesman, is darkly optimistic that they can keep prices low. "Anything to save the community some money,” he says. "We're not looking to get rich. Being rich is pointless nowadays. It's about, how can you survive? How can I feed my kids? How can we pay our bills?” I’m reminded of a conversation I had with the truck driver, Nick, who dropped off the Target load. He used to drive a taxi, until Uber ruined that. He prefers truck driving, but it was better at the height of the pandemic, when everyone was shopping online. Around that time, Nick’s wife was a third-party seller on Amazon. She stocked her inventory based on social media trends, a task complicated by the algorithm. The more she looked at videos of, say, people showing off their Stanley cup accessories, the more TikTok fed her those videos, until it was hard to know if people were actually buying them in the real world, or if she was just in an online feedback loop. Plus, Amazon charges high storage fees, so unsold product just sitting in their warehouse cost her money. She quit, and abandoned her merchandise. That’s where a lot of the stuff in the Amazing Binz came from: failing third-party vendors, looking to offload the detritus of brief and bygone trends. For a second, an image of the 21st century economy seems to come into focus here at the bin store. Nick, his wife, Amazing Binz’s owners, and even me, a freelance journalist, we’re all supposedly free agents, “entrepreneurs,” but in reality, we’re limited to buying whatever gets kicked down the funnel, and flipping it for all it’s worth. It’s like I can see our labor getting discounted by the day. Already, I've asked my editor if I can resell a version of this story elsewhere, to recoup a little more of my Amazing Binz investment. At 6:45 p.m. on Wednesday, a little over an hour until closing time, the shop is packed. Everything is now one dollar. An elderly woman finds a shoe she likes, a black slide with gold studs all over. But it's just one shoe. Ahmed is insisting she buy it, and says he’ll keep the other shoe for her when he finds it. “For a dollar you can’t beat it,” he says. He’s in a good mood, joking with this woman and her daughter. She’s apparently been looking for three days. “Those shoes are really cute,” I tell her. “Do you work here?” she asks. Maybe I’ve been here too long. After days of finding empty boxes, I finally find a loose elbow gel sleeve. It is heavy, slinky, comforting. After this, I find many of them, hiding in the bins like eels. Everything swims around the piles, and I revisit them as old friends, including the unopened boxes, known only by their clipped epithets: “Kiss Me I’m Irish wooden sign with lights,” “Lazy Susan for Refrigerator New.” The Jujube Enucleator box is full one day, and empty the next, without me ever seeing what was inside. The Dick Pics in Nature calendar remains, week after week. Who knows how many times these items have been bought and sold before they arrived here, how many more times they might be bought and sold. I imagine it all ending up in the same places eventually: the landfill or the waterways, where it will exist forever, first as choking hazard, then as nurdle. In the dwindling bins, I find another Trump flag, folded in plastic but unmistakable. Omran says I can have it. I unfurl it, stiff and plasticky, creased into a grid. I don’t want it, but what am I supposed to do? It will end up in the garbage one way or another. I stuff it in my bag. I ask, “How long have you guys been open?” It’s April 16, and Omran says they opened the doors on March 21. “I thought it was more than a month,” says Ahmed. “It’s been a long month,” says Omran. The Trump flag joins a small museum of items I have purchased since the bin store opened: a cat bed ($10), a felted flower garland ($6), four post-Valentine heart-shaped chocolate boxes ($5 for all), two small spring-form pans ($4 each), a large penis-shaped ice cube mold ($4), four bike inner tubes ($2 each), a box of ant traps that don’t work ($2). Did I need any of these things? Maybe the ant traps, if they’d worked, maybe the inner tubes. Mostly, I bought them because they were there, the same way I watch an Instagram reel because it pops up next. The irony is that if I were in the market for new pans or bedding, Amazing Binz would at this point be my best local option. It’s also simultaneously the most fun and most unsettling store on Baltimore Avenue, a combination that I find addictive, as many bin enjoyers do. I take one last lap, back into the farthest corner of the store, where the oldest stuff has accumulated in deep drifts, where the Wokaar lives, now separated from its box. Looking for what? I don’t know. It’s concentrated back here, layers of unwanted product, filtered all the way down the supply chain to this last bin, where it’s piling up like sand. As I stare at the piles, I almost expect them to start breaking down in front of me, each individual item decomposing into a pool of microplastics, what remains of its value finally depleted. I leave the store, and the bins where they are. They’ll be full again tomorrow. If you liked this blog, please share it!

Title: Wall Street Embraces Crypto: 4 IPO Listings In 7 Months

ByTomer Niv ByTomer Niv, Contributor. Illustration of Nasdaq and Bitcoin logos. Circle, the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), debuted on the NYSE today by raising $1.05 billion at $31 per share, valuing the company at roughly $8 billion. The IPO exceeded expectations and was one of the largest crypto-related listings since Coinbase in 2021. It signals a significant shift: crypto firms, especially those dealing in infrastructure or stablecoins, are now being viewed as more “institutionally safe” than speculative assets. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire emphasized in his X account that going public promotes transparency and trust - essential ingredients for bridging crypto and traditional finance. Crypto related IPOs. Galaxy Digital uplisted to Nasdaq in May 2025. Previously listed in Toronto, the firm made the move to gain greater liquidity and access to U.S. capital. Although it didn’t raise money on the day of its listing, Galaxy soon followed with a secondary offering. The uplisting was seen as a regulatory milestone - Galaxy shifted domicile from the Cayman Islands to Delaware to meet listing requirements. eToro, the Israeli social trading platform, went public the same week. Priced at $52, the stock surged nearly 30% on debut, giving it a ~$5.6 billion valuation. eToro’s pivot to regulatory compliance, such as limiting its U.S. crypto services and settling with the SEC, played a major role in making the IPO viable. Crypto now forms a significant chunk of eToro’s revenue, blurring the line between fintech and crypto-native businesses. Exodus, maker of a self-custody crypto wallet, uplisted to NYSE in late 2024. Though smaller in size (~$800–900 million market cap), its listing marked a step forward for crypto software firms. The move followed the election of President Trump and a more crypto-friendly regulatory tone, signaling a potential shift in how smaller crypto players can access public markets. Yoni and Ronen Assia, co-founders of eToro, after the eToro IPO event outside the Nasdaq in New ... More York. Coinbase’s direct listing in April 2021 was historic. It opened at $381, peaking at $429, and ended the day with a valuation around $85 billion. The listing legitimized crypto on Wall Street and established a blueprint for future IPOs. Today, Coinbase has gained further credibility by entering the S&P 500 index in 2025. Robinhood, though not crypto-native, made its mark in July 2021. The IPO raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation. Robinhood’s significant crypto trading volumes made it a proxy for retail crypto enthusiasm. Its listing reinforced the narrative that consumer fintechs with crypto exposure could thrive in public markets. Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase. Companies like Marathon, Riot, and Strategy (formelly known as MicroStrategy) went public before they were crypto-linked: Marathon and Riot pivoted to Bitcoin mining from totally different businesses (patents and biotech) and reached $4-5 billion market caps during bull cycles. Strategy, originally an analytics software company, became a de facto Bitcoin ETF, amassing over 568,000 BTC and reaching a $25 billion valuation. These firms illustrate how legacy businesses have transformed into crypto leaders, even if their IPOs predated the sector’s rise. Michael Saylor, co-founder and CEO of Strategy. Several crypto companies are considered strong IPO candidates: ConsenSys (developer of MetaMask and other Ethereum developer tools) is viewed as nearly IPO-ready, with a $7 billiob valuation and ongoing internal preparations. It could become the first pure-play blockchain infrastructure listing. Ledger, the hardware wallet maker, is likely to IPO on Euronext or a U.S. exchange. With $500+ million in funding and strong global brand recognition, it could appeal to security-conscious investors. Fireblocks, an institutional custody provider, is valued at $8 billion. While in no rush to go public, it has been hiring C-suite leaders in preparation. Chainalysis, the blockchain intelligence and analytics firm, is a key compliance partner to governments and businesses. Leadership changes and new board members hint at IPO readiness. Kraken may be the next major U.S. exchange to list. It’s been expanding globally and acquiring traditional trading platforms like NinjaTrader. Revolut, while not crypto-native, is seen as a possible candidate for IPO. With its massive user base and crypto integration, it would highlight the fintech-crypto convergence. 1. Maturing Crypto Businesses: Firms like Circle and Coinbase now resemble traditional fintechs - with compliance teams, revenue transparency, and risk management. This appeals to public investors seeking durable growth. 2. Regulatory Shift: Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has signaled a more crypto-friendly stance. The SEC’s softer tone (e.g. approving spot Bitcoin ETFs and dismissing many lawsuits against crypto companies) and moves toward stablecoin legislation reduce uncertainty for would-be public companies. 3. Institutional Buy-In: Heavyweights like BlackRock, Visa, and Fidelity are not only backing crypto firms, taking part in their IPOs, but also launching crypto-related services. Their involvement lends legitimacy and opens doors for broader investment. 4. Better Investor Protections: Public listings require disclosures and financial oversight, giving both retail and institutional investors greater confidence. 2025 is emerging as a watershed year in which crypto and traditional finance begin to truly converge. What was once considered a fringe sector defined by volatility and skepticism is now producing companies that are not only IPO-ready, but in some cases are joining the ranks of the S&P 500. Crypto-native firms like Circle, Galaxy Digital, eToro, and Exodus have all gone public over the past year, signaling that digital asset businesses are entering the financial mainstream. They join earlier listings from Coinbase and Robinhood, which helped lay the groundwork for what is now a rapidly expanding category of “crypto stocks.” For investors, this shift presents a broader and more diversified opportunity set. The market now includes publicly traded exchanges, self-custody wallets, institutional infrastructure providers, and fintech apps with integrated crypto trading and staking features. This diversity reflects a maturing industry that is increasingly defined not by speculative trading, but by real business models and long-term strategic vision. Importantly, the move into public markets also brings greater accountability. Listed companies must meet higher standards for financial reporting, compliance, and governance - which in turn makes them more attractive to institutional capital. While significant risks remain, including regulatory fragmentation across jurisdictions and persistent market volatility, the underlying foundation of the crypto sector is stronger than ever. Going public enables these companies to access capital and scale responsibly, under the watchful eye of both regulators and public shareholders. In short, crypto’s entrance into public equity markets marks a pivotal step toward institutional credibility, market discipline, and sustainable growth.

Title: From Bitcoin Maxis to Yield Farmers: A Crypto Archetype Glossary

Highlights Crypto culture is diverse and tribal, with distinct archetypes like bitcoin maximalists, builders, degens, yield farmers, OG HODLers and now institutional players — each with unique ideologies, goals and influence on the ecosystem. Builders and degens shape innovation and speculation, where builders focus on long-term infrastructure and user experience, while degens embrace high-risk, fast-paced strategies like yield farming and meme coin trading. Institutional adoption is legitimizing crypto, with major firms and banks entering the space — shifting the balance of power but raising concerns over regulation, centralization and the original ethos of decentralization. The cryptocurrency landscape can be tribal, full of vibrant archetypes that each hold distinct ideologies and goals.

Δ From bitcoin maxis to degens and yield farmers, even OG HODLers, the crypto space isn’t just pure technology. To its most diehard supporters, the industry represents a powder keg of culture, ideology and economics, all crashing into each other on-chain. For traditional players, understanding how different factions describe themselves can serve as a way to understand what they are looking to get out of, or build into, at the intersection of finance and blockchain. The bitcoin maximalist is one of the more recognizable personas dominating the crypto sphere. To maxis, bitcoin isn’t just the first cryptocurrency. It’s the only one that matters. They can be found pushing things like strategic bitcoin reserves and telling anyone who will listen that the value of bitcoin will one day reach the millions. These bitcoin maxis, who can frequently refer to themselves as being “orange-pilled,” were once on the fringe. But they are becoming more mainstream as crypto itself becomes more embraced across the financial landscape. Dozens of companies, following the lead of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), have now launched corporate bitcoin treasuries, turning their businesses, in essence, into a financial bet on the digital currency’s future value. In April, a new company formed by Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether Holdings SA and SoftBank Group, Twenty One Capital, aimed to become one of the largest public holders of bitcoin by deploying billions of dollars to stockpile the digital asset. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said May 19 that the bank now offers its clients access to bitcoin. The bank announced Wednesday (June 4) plans to offer financing to clients using spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as collateral. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said in May. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.” Read also: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream? What Treasury Execs Should Know For crypto advocates who view themselves as builders, the blockchain is an experimental playground. These are the developers, engineers and entrepreneurs deploying smart contracts, creating payment networks, and launching Layer 2 solutions. They are often chain-agnostic and driven by a hacker ethos of permissionless innovation. “The biggest problem in crypto is not adoption, it’s the user experience,” Mesh CEO and co-founder Bam Azizi told PYMNTS last month. “You need to make payments so simple that even a grandmother will use it one day, maybe without even knowing that the mechanism behind the scenes is a stablecoin … to do that, you need to do a lot of heavy lifting.” That’s where the builders come in. They can be dismissive of the hype cycles (and market collapses) but are invested in shipping products that work and bring blockchain closer to institutional-grade architecture. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS in April. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” Degens represent the risk-tolerant end of the spectrum. They are the high-flying crypto market traders, found on exchanges like Binance and formerly FTX. For them, crypto is a game of high-stakes strategy. Yield farming, airdrop hunting, meme coin speculation — these activities aren’t just profit-driven, they’re cultural rituals. Degens are all about tokenizing everything onto the blockchain and then trading or building financial products with it. To gain their favor (and investment fees), the marketplace is responding. Crypto exchange Kraken is planning to offer tokenized versions of more than 50 stocks, called xStocks, including names like Apple, Tesla and Nvidia, along with exchange-traded funds (ETFs), showing that blockchain is increasingly maturing beyond its earlier history. Kraken’s xStocks aren’t targeting American day traders or Wall Street veterans. Instead, they’re aimed at retail investors in emerging and underserved markets. But as crypto market regulation starts to shape up in the United States, what might happen next could be anyone’s guess. Yield farmers are similar in that these individuals or entities are seeking to maximize their returns by strategically moving their crypto assets across different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Yield farming is essentially the act of putting crypto assets to work to earn passive income, often in the form of interest, rewards or tokens. Yield farmers seek out platforms offering the highest annual percentage yield. They may switch protocols frequently, sometimes daily or hourly, in pursuit of better returns. See also: The CFO and Treasurer’s Guide to Digital Assets The OG HODLers are the original gangsters of crypto, so to speak. These are the individuals who bought in early, weathered the Mt. Gox collapse, and held through multiple bear markets. To them, crypto is not a career or a play-to-earn game. It’s a multi-decade revolution, and OGs often sit on holdings and prefer cold wallets to constant engagement. Some may argue this tribalism is holding the industry back, creating echo chambers and slowing down consensus on technical standards. Others believe it’s a feature, not a bug, the sign of a healthy, pluralistic ecosystem. As crypto matures, the stakes get higher. Governments are crafting regulations, institutional money is flowing in, and technological standards are being codified. In this landscape, who gets to speak for crypto? Who sets the rules? Who gets funded? New archetypes are also entering the arena, such as crypto corporates. Once derided, institutional players are now a dominant force. Whether it’s BlackRock pushing Bitcoin ETFs, Visa integrating stablecoins, or Coinbase going public, corporate involvement is legitimizing crypto in the eyes of regulators and traditional investors. However, many experts worry that this comes at the cost of KYC, surveillance and centralization. Still, the capital and stability these entities provide are reshaping the competitive landscape. And their regulatory capabilities are helping shape the future.

Title: Switch 2 Stock Tracker: Select In-Store Availability, Online Target Restock Tomorrow

We're tracking which retailers have Nintendo's new gaming handheld in stock both online and in-store. Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. Nintendo's brand-new Nintendo Switch 2 is technically available now, but as with preorders, consoles are disappearing from stores faster than retailers can stock them. For Nintendo fans hoping to get your hands on one soon, you've got a couple of options, but you'll need to be quick. CNET is here to help give you the best chance of success. Our dedicated shopping team is scouring the web for any availability -- whether it's online or in-store -- and bringing you all the latest updates. We've rounded up everything you need to know about current stocks below, and we'll continue to update this page regularly in the coming days, so be sure to check back often. Currently, your best chance of getting a Switch 2 right away is visiting a store in person... unless you're willing to pay twice as much. On Sunday, Newegg started offering the new consoles at a whopping $400 premium, and it's selling the $449 console right now for $849. Additionally, Costco has the console listed as available, but you'll have to be a member to shop. As of right now, Best Buy does not have the Switch 2 available for purchase online, though you may be able to snag one in person at the nearest location. At the moment, the Switch 2 is only available in person at Best Buy. As with the US, Best Buy Canada is only offering in-person availability for the Switch 2 at the moment. Even with the Switch 2's boosted storage, you may want to increase its memory with a microSD card. This Samsung Express microSD is designed specifically for Nintendo's new console and features a unique Mario-inspired design. It costs $60 and can be purchased online. As with other US retailers, the standalone console and Mario Kart World bundle are currently sold out online at GameStop. A limited supply was available for purchase at the midnight release, so you may be able to find one in-store if you're lucky, but chances are pretty slim. Like all other retailers, GameStop is currently sold out online. The Switch 2 console is also sold out at GameStop Canada. If we do see some restocks here, it's important to note that orders are limited to one Switch 2 per household. After initial restocks, the Switch 2 is now sold out online at Walmart. The retailer also had some in-person availability for a midnight release, and while it's likely sold out just about everywhere, you can check if any nearby stores have it in stock. The Switch 2 is now sold out online at Walmart and most in-store locations. Just like the US, Walmart Canada is now completely sold out online. Note that an unverified third-party retailer is selling the standalone console for an outrageously inflated price, but we definitely recommend avoiding this. Target is offering in-person shopping, and if you're lucky, you may be still able to find the Switch 2 in stock near you. However, the Switch 2 is sold out at Target for online shoppers, and you cannot you order it for pickup from your local store. You can sign up to be notified when it's back in stock, which may be as soon as today since Target has staggered its release. We'll keep you posted. You can shop the console in-store now, with an online restock set to go live Monday. Even with the Switch 2's boosted storage, you may be looking to increase its memory with a microSD card. This Samsung Express microSD is designed specifically for Nintendo's new console and even features a unique Mario-inspired design. As of now, Newegg is still sold out of both versions of the console if you're buying directly, and it's unclear when the next restock will be. However, there is a verified third-party seller that has it listed for $849. That's a $400 markup, and may not be the best option -- but it is available to purchase, for now. It's also worth noting that Newegg is slightly less popular than major retailers like Walmart or Target, which could give you a better chance of securing an order during any future direct restocks, so keep an eye out. Both the standalone console and Mario Kart World bundle are currently sold out. This compact camera costs $55 and plugs directly into the Switch 2 console or dock's USB-C port. It allows you to chat with friends or access in-game features for select titles. The camera has a wide-angle lens, which you can adjust to keep yourself in frame easily. It also automatically adjusts its brightness so your face is always visible. To help combat scalpers, Nintendo requires you to have an invitation to purchase the Switch 2, with priority being given to Nintendo Switch Online members who've had a paid membership for at least 12 months and have had a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours as of April 2. These invitations are first come, first served and will be valid for 72 hours. You can still register now if you haven't already. As with its preorders, you'll have to register and receive an invitation to purchase the Switch 2 directly from Nintendo. You can register your interest for either console, but you have to log in to do so. Just like US shoppers, Canadian gamers will have to register and then wait to receive an invitation to purchase the Switch 2 directly from Nintendo. As with the Switch 2 console, accessories like the $85 Pro Controller will require you to register for an invitation if you want to order one directly from Nintendo. The Switch 2 is not available for purchase at Amazon in the US, but Canadian shoppers can request an invite for either the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle. As of now, the Switch 2 is still not available at Amazon in the US, and there's no information about whether or when that will change. Canadian shoppers can request an invite if they're hoping to grab either the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle at Amazon. Costco is one of the only retailers with online availability right now, but you'll need to be a member to grab one of these consoles. Act fast if you don't want to miss out. Costco has a unique Switch 2 bundle available. It includes the console and Mario Kart World, as well as a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership and upgrade packs for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. Several Staples stores around the country have the Switch 2 available for purchase in-store. You can check the list of participating locations here, but note that this does not reflect current availability. Staples has a limited supply of Switch 2 consoles available for purchase in person. Please note that not all locations are participating, and orders are limited to one per person. While some lucky UK shoppers were able to nab a console from online retailers like Amazon, Argos and Very, those opportunities have since run dry. However, the Nintendo Switch 2 is available for purchase directly from Nintendo for now. Act fast if you don't want to miss out. Note: We have no confirmation that the digital download code for Mario Kart World in the UK Switch 2 bundle will work with non-UK Nintendo accounts. The power cables are also different for each region. If you plan to buy a UK Switch 2 from outside the country, please know there's no guarantee it'll work as expected. Both the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart World bundle are sold out at Amazon UK (at the time of publishing). Unlike the US and Canada, UK shoppers don't need an invitation to purchase the Switch 2 directly from Nintendo. You will, however, need a paid Nintendo Online Membership. Games and accessories are also available now. Both versions of the console are currently sold out. Both the standalone console and Mario Kart World bundle are currently sold out right now. ShopTo has the Switch 2 available for "backorder," though we're somewhat wary of this, since there's no way of knowing when you'll actually receive the console. The standalone console and the Mario Kart World bundle have both sold out. Both versions of the console are currently sold out online and in-store. The basic console and the console and accessory bundles are sold out, but a handful of Mario Kart World bundle option are in stock right now (at time of publishing). Both versions are now sold out online. The console is not currently available, but you'll also find plenty of games and accessories in stock. There's no joy for Nintendo fans at The Game Collection right now, with listings for the Switch 2 console and the Mario Kart World bundle showing as out of stock. The Switch 2 is available now, though you'll likely have a challenging time getting your hands on one. The vast majority of retailers are currently sold out online, and while there may be some stragglers available for purchase in-store, it will ultimately depend on where you're located. We'll be keeping a close eye on stocks as they fluctuate in the coming days, so be sure to check this page often for the latest on availability. Read more: How Nintendo Is Combating Switch 2 Scalpers There was some concern that the new US tariffs were going to lead to some significant price hikes on the standalone console and the Mario Kart World bundle. Fortunately, Nintendo has confirmed that the original pricing still stands. The console is available for $450, with the Mario Kart World bundle priced at $500. However, there has been a change to the price of some accessories, with some increasing by $5. For the new Switch 2, Nintendo has ditched the colored Joy-Cons for a more sleek, monochrome look -- although there are still pops of red and blue around the analog sticks. As of now, Nintendo hasn't said anything about additional colors. Additionally, it's rumored that Samsung -- which makes the displays for the Switch 2 -- is pushing for an OLED version of the console. The Mario Kart series has been a long-standing tentpole for Nintendo and fans were thrilled to hear that a new title would be accompanying the new console. But the excitement was dampened by the announcement that the new game will come with an increased price tag: $80 for the digital edition or $90 if you want a physical copy. However, you can bundle a digital copy with the console for $500 total, which saves you $30 compared with buying them separately. It's an excellent value if it's a game you're certain you want in your library and likely the only "discount" we'll see on this title for quite some time. Plus, Nintendo recently announced that this bundle will be available only "through fall 2025," which means you'll have a limited chance to take advantage of these savings. There are still some mixed feelings about Nintendo's newest console. While some are happy to see that Nintendo hasn't altered much about the wildly popular original Switch, others feel not enough has changed to justify the $150 price hike -- with CNET gaming expert Scott Stein calling it a console that "feels a lot like an updated version of a system many people already own." The confirmation that the US tariffs won't be leading to any further price increases has helped stifle gamers' exasperation a bit, but many are still unhappy with the fact that select games will be selling for up to $20 more than the standard $60. We're eager to see if most gamers consider the price hikes worth it now that they're finally getting their hands on the new console and games.

Title: Investors Might Need A Waste Bag For Freshpet’s Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/06/05/investors-might-need-a-waste-bag-for-freshpets-stock/

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Pet food is displayed in a refrigerated cases at the Freshpet Inc. production facility in Bethlehem, ... More Pennsylvania, U.S., on Monday, Nov. 9, 2015. Freshpet produces the only industrial refrigerated pet food on the market, which is made with only fresh ingredients and eschews preservatives. Sales of premium dog food have surged 45 percent to $10.5 billion in the U.S. since 2009 and now account for more than half of the market. Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg I originally put Freshpet Inc. (FRPT) in the Danger Zone on February 2, 2022 and most recently reiterated my bearish opinion on the stock in October 17, 2022. Despite falling 45% YTD, I’m here to remind you: this stock remains dangerous. Figure 1: Freshpet Outperformance as a Short From 2/3/22 Through 5/9/25 FRPT Performance as Danger Zone Pick Freshpet has successfully grown its retail presence and increased its total store count (stores that sell Freshpet products) by 380 from the end of 4Q24 to the end of 1Q25. Similarly, the company’s revenue increased 18% YoY in 1Q25, mainly driven by volume gains of 15% and favorable price/mix of 3%. Additionally, Freshpet’s adjusted EBITDA increased from $31 million in 1Q24 to $36 million in 1Q25, though I show below why this metric is misleading. Retail improvements and top-line growth aside, Freshpet’s fundamentals remain in very poor shape. The company missed earnings estimates in its 1Q25 report and lowered full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to the range of $190-$210 million, compared to prior guidance of “at least $210 million”. Freshpet’s management provides a misleading view of the company’s profitability when it directs investors to its “Adjusted” EBITDA. From 2019 to the TTM, Freshpet’s Adjusted EBITDA improved from $29 million to $167 million, while its GAAP net income rose from -$1 million to $16 million. Over the same time, the company’s economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, fell from -$11 million to -$88 million. It is a big red flag when the company’s preferred non-GAAP metric is rising while its economic earnings are declining, or even worse, when its GAAP net income gets outpaced as well. The discrepancy between the metrics comes largely from the company removing $8.8 million in non-cash share-based compensation when calculating 1Q25 adjusted EBITDA. For reference, Freshpet’s 1Q25 GAAP net income was -$13 million. The discrepancy should come as no surprise as Freshpet openly admits in earnings releases that “the non-GAAP measures are not and should not be considered an alternative to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures”. Figure 2: Freshpet’s Adjusted EBITDA vs. Net Income vs. Economic Earnings: 2019 – TTM FRPT Misleading Earnings 2019-TTM Freshpet’s total operating expenses, which include cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses have remained high for years. For instance, over the last five years, total operating expenses averaged 106% of revenue. More recently, Freshpet’s total operating expenses rose from 96% of revenue in 1Q24 to 104% of revenue in 1Q25. The increase was driven by SG&A expenses rising from 36% of revenue to 44% of revenue over the same time. Considering the company’s high operating costs, it should come as no surprise that Freshpet has been and continues to burn cash. Freshpet’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis every year in my model (dating back to 2017). On a quarterly basis, Freshpet’s FCF has been negative in 34 of the 36 quarters in my model. The only two quarters with positive FCF occurred in 4Q16 and 2Q18. From 2019 through 1Q25, Freshpet has burned through a cumulative $1.2 billion (29% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 3. Figure 3: Freshpet’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow Since 2019 FRPT FCF Burn 2019-1Q25 Despite its cash burn rate, I did not make Freshpet a Zombie Stock because its cash on hand can support its TTM cash burn rate for 34 months (more than the 24 months cut off) from the end of May 2025. Note that Freshpet was a Zombie Stock before Jana Partners, in 4Q22, took a 10% stake in Freshpet and boosted the company’s cash on hand enough to extend its cash burn runway past 24 months. Jana Partners exited its position in Fresphet in 2Q24. Consequently, FRPT is at risk of going back on the Zombie Stock list should its cash burn runway fall below 24 months. Freshpet faces direct competition from both larger companies like Nestle (NSRGY), Mars Inc., General Mills (GIS), Colgate-Palmolive (CL), and Chewy (CHWY), as well as smaller, lesser-known start-ups. Additionally, the company faces heavy competition from private label pet food brands. In the most recently available comparable public data (Mars is privately owned and doesn’t disclose pet business sales every year), the pet food market was dominated by Nestle and Mars. In 2023, Nestle (32%) and Mars (29%) combined to make up 61% of the global pet food market. Hill’s Pet Nutrition (owned by Colgate-Palmolive) General Mills (GIS), The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM), rounded out the top five. Freshpet held just over 1% market share. See Figure 4. Figure 4: Freshpet’s Market Share Compared to Peers FRPT Market Share 2023 Importantly, these companies have significant competitive advantages in the form of larger manufacturing scale, a more extensive distribution network, and other business lines that generate cash to re-invest in the business. If I analyze estimated market share based on Freshpet’s 2024 sales and the estimated pet food market size in 2024, I find that the company holds just 1% of the estimated market. Competitors also include general retailers, such as Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and Amazon (AMZN), each of which sell their own private label pet brands. Freshpet not only lags the competition in market share, but also in profitability. Even though Freshpet achieved a record net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) of $50 million in 2024, profits have fallen to -$10 million in 1Q25, down from $9 million in 1Q24. Similarly, the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) hit a peak of 4% in 2024, but has fallen to 2% in the TTM ending 1Q25. Per Figure 5, Freshpet has the lowest ROIC and one of the lowest NOPAT margins in the industry. Figure 5: Freshpet’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM FRPT Profitability vs. Peers Taking market share in an industry already dominated by larger and more profitable companies will be hard to do, especially considering that Freshpet’s revenue is entirely undiversified or 100% dependent on its pet food sales. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into Freshpet’s stock price. Freshpet’s stock is priced as if it will grow profits at accelerated rates while also taking huge chunks of market share. I also present additional DCF scenarios to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Freshpet fails to achieve these overly optimistic expectations. To justify its current price of ~$80/share, my model shows Freshpet would have to: In this scenario, Freshpet would generate $11.7 billion in sales in 2034, which is 12x its TTM sales, 3x Colgate-Palmolive’s TTM pet food sales, and 5x General Mill’s pet food sales. This scenario also implies Freshpet’s NOPAT would reach $608 million in 2034, compared to the company’s all-time high NOPAT of $50 million and TTM NOPAT of $30 million. The implied sales in this scenario equate to 7% of the forecasted global pet food market in 2034, which is far above the company’s estimated 1% market share in 2024. Furthermore, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Freshpet’s share price even more unrealistic. If we, instead, assume Freshpet: the stock would be worth $49/share today – a 40% downside to the current price. In this scenario, Freshpet would grow sales to $7.2 billion in 2034, which would be around 8x the company’s TTM sales, 2x Colgate-Palmolive’s TTM pet food sales, and 3x General Mill’s pet food sales. The implied sales in this second scenario would represent 4% of the pet foods market in 2034, which is 4x the company’s market share in 2024. If I instead assume Freshpet: the stock would be worth just $26/share today – a 68% downside to the current price. The implied sales in this scenario would still represent 3% of the projected global pet foods market in 2034. Figure 6 compares Freshpet’s implied future revenue in these scenarios to its historical revenue. For comparison, I include the TTM pet food sales of peers Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and General Mills (GIS). Figure 6: Freshpet’s Historical and Implied Revenue: DCF Valuation Scenarios FRPT DCF Implied NOPAT Scenarios Each of the above scenarios assumes Freshpet grows revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that highlight the unrealistically high expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Freshpet’s invested capital grew 43% compounded annually from 2019 through the TTM. If I assume Freshpet’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Freshpet is worth buying at any price. The answer is likely no. The company has $477 million in total debt, $42 million in outstanding employee stock options, and just $226 million excess cash. Freshpet has an economic book value, or no-growth value, of <$1/share. In other words, I do not think equity investors will ever see anywhere close to the level of economic earnings required to justify anything more than $1/share under normal operations.

Competitors also include general retailers, such as Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and Amazon (AMZN), each of which sell their own private label pet brands. Freshpet not only lags the competition in market share, but also in profitability. Even though Freshpet achieved a record net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) of $50 million in 2024, profits have fallen to -$10 million in 1Q25, down from $9 million in 1Q24. Similarly, the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) hit a peak of 4% in 2024, but has fallen to 2% in the TTM ending 1Q25. Per Figure 5, Freshpet has the lowest ROIC and one of the lowest NOPAT margins in the industry. Figure 5: Freshpet’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM FRPT Profitability vs. Peers Taking market share in an industry already dominated by larger and more profitable companies will be hard to do, especially considering that Freshpet’s revenue is entirely undiversified or 100% dependent on its pet food sales. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into Freshpet’s stock price. Freshpet’s stock is priced as if it will grow profits at accelerated rates while also taking huge chunks of market share. I also present additional DCF scenarios to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Freshpet fails to achieve these overly optimistic expectations. To justify its current price of ~$80/share, my model shows Freshpet would have to: In this scenario, Freshpet would generate $11.7 billion in sales in 2034, which is 12x its TTM sales, 3x Colgate-Palmolive’s TTM pet food sales, and 5x General Mill’s pet food sales. This scenario also implies Freshpet’s NOPAT would reach $608 million in 2034, compared to the company’s all-time high NOPAT of $50 million and TTM NOPAT of $30 million. The implied sales in this scenario equate to 7% of the forecasted global pet food market in 2034, which is far above the company’s estimated 1% market share in 2024. Furthermore, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Freshpet’s share price even more unrealistic. If we, instead, assume Freshpet: the stock would be worth $49/share today – a 40% downside to the current price. In this scenario, Freshpet would grow sales to $7.2 billion in 2034, which would be around 8x the company’s TTM sales, 2x Colgate-Palmolive’s TTM pet food sales, and 3x General Mill’s pet food sales. The implied sales in this second scenario would represent 4% of the pet foods market in 2034, which is 4x the company’s market share in 2024. If I instead assume Freshpet: the stock would be worth just $26/share today – a 68% downside to the current price. The implied sales in this scenario would still represent 3% of the projected global pet foods market in 2034. Figure 6 compares Freshpet’s implied future revenue in these scenarios to its historical revenue. For comparison, I include the TTM pet food sales of peers Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and General Mills (GIS). Figure 6: Freshpet’s Historical and Implied Revenue: DCF Valuation Scenarios FRPT DCF Implied NOPAT Scenarios Each of the above scenarios assumes Freshpet grows revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that highlight the unrealistically high expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Freshpet’s invested capital grew 43% compounded annually from 2019 through the TTM. If I assume Freshpet’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Freshpet is worth buying at any price. The answer is likely no. The company has $477 million in total debt, $42 million in outstanding employee stock options, and just $226 million excess cash. Freshpet has an economic book value, or no-growth value, of <$1/share. In other words, I do not think equity investors will ever see anywhere close to the level of economic earnings required to justify anything more than $1/share under normal operations.

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Army of robots. 3D illustration Big companies are about to make even more money. They have discovered they no longer need armies of new hires to grow—extremely bullish news for shareholders because human employees are expensive. Good ones can also be notoriously elusive. For example, I’m the longest-standing member of my kids’ school marketing committee, and we’re always scrambling for volunteers (what non-profit isn’t?). Until now, that is. Over the weekend, we welcomed the most talented marketer I’ve ever worked with to our team: ChatGPT 4.5. “GPT” graciously accepted our volunteer position, and we’re already actively boosting online referrals for the school. I’m learning cutting-edge “AI referral” techniques straight from the entity that invented them. It was the easiest recruitment effort I’ve ever experienced. GPT and I were already collaborating closely to market and sell several software products, so extending our teamwork to the non-profit world was seamless. The same dynamic is quietly playing out at for–profit companies, particularly the tech giants that dominate the cap-weighted S&P 500. A senior executive friend at Meta (META) recently confirmed to me that the company has essentially frozen hiring, pivoting entirely toward AI-driven growth. It already shows in the numbers. Over the past year Meta has increased revenues by 22% while only hiring 10% more people. Sales are growing faster than humans, a trend that I expect to accelerate in the months and years ahead. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if Meta has already reached peak headcount—which means profits are set to surge even more. And Meta isn’t alone in this “growing without hiring” trend. Alphabet (GOOG) grew revenues by 14% without any net new hires. And Nvidia (NVDA) did grow headcount by 13%, but for good reason—sales exploded by 126%! Microsoft (MSFT) is likewise sailing along without the need for new engineers, with 16% revenue growth on just a 3% headcount increase: Tech Growth The AI adoption at these companies is just beginning. These profit machines are already selling $1 to $2 million in product per employee, but their profits are going to pop as they sell even more without the expense drag of adding new employees! This four-pack packs 20% of the S&P 500 index. When we combine Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Netflix (NFLX) and Apple (AAPL)—four more tech companies that are scaling without hiring—we have 32% of the index. Earlier in the year, I warned that the “tech heaviness” of the S&P 500 was dangerous—and it sure was during the tariff troubles of March and April. But with trade tensions fading and tech profits exploding thanks to lean payrolls, these big 8 companies are now set to power the index higher. Plus, we have a weakening US dollar. Stocks are, of course, priced in dollars. So, a softer dollar is another bullish catalyst for the S&P 500. As income investors, we can tap this rising tide for steady income. To do so, we’ll use covered calls—a strategy where we buy stocks and then sell (“write”) call options to other investors. We earn income now from the option premiums we collect, paid upfront to agree to sell our shares at a higher price later. Market volatility from a tumultuous spring means these options pay generous premiums right now (covered call options pay more when things are bouncing around!). So, this is a good market moment to cash in on leftover fear. I’m talking about dividends up to 9.7% that will benefit from the S&P 500 soaring towards 9000. (Yes, it sounds wild—but with record profits plus a declining dollar, this is a potential price target before the end of Trump 2.0.) Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversified Equity Income Fund (EXG) yields 9.2% and trades at a 6% discount. That’s a sweet deal because it holds big winners like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, then boosts income by selling covered calls on the S&P 500 and international indices. The income from these constantly expiring calls is the key to the EXG’s sky-high “synthetic yield.” The fund collects premiums from option buyers immediately after it writes these calls, generating steady income for shareholders. We can think of this as “renting” out positions to generate extra cash. EXG owns the underlying shares behind the S&P 500. Each month it leases its collection of stocks and collects the option premiums. Rinse and repeat. Nuveen S&P 500 Buy-Write Income Fund (BXMX) pays 8.1% and trades at a 9% discount to its net asset value (NAV)—another good deal because we’re talking Apple and Amazon for 91 cents on the dollar. Finally the Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD) dishes a 9.7% dividend. It is an ETF, so it trades at par (“fair value”), as most do. XYLD owns the S&P 500 stocks and has also written calls on the S&P 500 that expire later in June. When that happens, the fund will write new calls for July—delivering more tasty income to its investors. Covered Call Funds As sellers of covered calls, they exult in market volatility that delivers high option premiums. Plus, their NAVs have a tailwind—tech profits popping!

Title: Time To Buy AMZN Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. A view of the Amazon warehouse in Pawlikowice, Poland on May 29, 2025. (Photo by Jakub ... More Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is really leaning into AI, recently announcing a massive $10 billion investment in new data centers in North Carolina. Like Google and Microsoft, Amazon has been a major player in the AI boom, spending a whopping $222 billion on capital expenditures since 2022. The stock has seen a nice jump lately, climbing 24% from around $167 on April 21 to $208 now. This rally seems to be fueled by the broader market’s positive reaction to new trade deals and a pause on reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China. The probability of the U.S. economy going into a recession this year has also come down from 60% earlier to 40% now, according to J.P. Morgan Research. Given the change in overall market sentiment, you might be wondering if Amazon is still a smart investment after its recent climb. We believe it is. Even with the recent rally, Amazon shows strong operational growth and solid financial health, and its stock isn't overpriced. Our analysis dives deep into Amazon’s investment potential by looking at its current valuation compared to its recent operating performance and overall financial health. We’ve assessed Amazon across key areas like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. Our findings show that Amazon has a strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – RGTI Stock: What’s Next After An 1,100% Rally? When we look at AMZN stock against the broader market, it seems pretty reasonable. Amazon’s price-to-sales ratio is 3.4 times, which is pretty close to the S&P 500’s 3.0 times. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.3 times is higher than the market’s 26.4 times, but its price-to-free cash flow ratio is 19.3 times, which is slightly better than the S&P 500’s 20.5 times. This means Amazon is doing a good job generating cash compared to its price. Check out our dashboard on Amazon’s Valuation Ratios for more details. This moderate valuation suggests that Amazon isn't really getting a premium for its growth potential right now. It's likely that those high capital expenditures we mentioned earlier have made some investors a bit nervous. While that higher P/E ratio signals that the market expects Amazon's earnings to keep growing, it also means the stock could be vulnerable if that growth slows down. However, it's worth noting that this 33x P/E is actually lower than Amazon's average P/E of 46x over the past two years. Amazon’s revenue just keeps climbing, showing how good they are at expanding across all their different businesses. Over the last three years, their annual revenue has grown by an average of 11%, much better than the S&P 500’s 5.5%. This strong performance continued in the past year, with revenues jumping 10.1% from $591 billion to $650 billion. Looking at their most recent quarterly results, things are still looking good. Revenues grew 8.6% to $156 billion compared to $143 billion in the same period last year. This consistent growth, whether we're looking at annual or quarterly numbers, really highlights how Amazon's diverse business model keeps them expanding, even as they get bigger and bigger. While Amazon’s revenues are trending higher, its profitability tells a slightly different story, and it might explain why some investors are a bit hesitant. For instance, their operating margin is 11.0%, which is a bit lower than the S&P 500's average of 13.2%. This suggests they're facing some challenges in turning all that revenue into efficient operations. Similarly, Amazon's net income margin of 10.1% also lags behind the broader market's 11.6% average. However, Amazon’s operating cash flow margin is 17.5%, actually beating the S&P 500’s 14.9%. This means they’re doing a great job at generating cash, even if their accounting profits seem lower. This difference often comes down to Amazon’s huge investments in growth and infrastructure. These investments might hit the company’s short-term profit margins, but they’re setting it up for bigger growth down the road. Amazon’s balance sheet is incredibly strong, giving them a really solid base to handle any economic bumps in the road. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio is super low at just 6.1%, which is way better than the S&P 500’s average of 19.9%. This conservative approach means Amazon has tons of financial wiggle room for big investments. They’re also sitting on a good amount of cash. Cash and cash equivalents make up 14.7% of their total assets, slightly more than the broader market’s 13.8%. With $95 billion in cash and $643 billion in total assets, Amazon has serious resources to chase new growth opportunities and ride out any tough times. Looking back at how Amazon's stock performed during past market downturns gives us some good insights. It shows they can be pretty resilient, but also quite volatile. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Amazon actually held up pretty well. Their stock only dropped 22.7% compared to the S&P 500's 33.9% plunge, and it bounced back to pre-crisis levels in just two months. However, things were a bit different during the 2022 inflation shock. Amazon's stock took a bigger hit, falling 56.1% while the market dropped 25.4%. It took almost two years for the stock to fully recover, which just goes to show how growth stocks can feel more pain when interest rates go up and valuations get squeezed. The 2008 financial crisis presented similar challenges, with Amazon declining 65.3% against the market's 56.8% drop, though it also recovered within two years. These patterns suggest that while Amazon tends to swing more during severe market stress, it typically has the underlying strength to bounce back over time. We believe Amazon is an attractive investment right now. It offers a good valuation combined with incredibly strong fundamentals and a solid financial position. The company is delivering double-digit revenue growth and boasts a fortress-like balance sheet. These strengths outweigh any minor concerns about profitability. Notably, Amazon’s AWS segment is far more profitable, boasting estimated EBITDA margins of around 45% last year, than its other businesses, which have EBITDA margins under 15%. With AWS's contribution to the company's overall sales on the rise—up from 12% in 2021 to 17% last year—the overall profitability will also improve. Furthermore, with a proven ability to recover from downturns, Amazon provides an excellent entry point into the long-term growth trends of the ongoing AI boom. It’s a strong addition for growth-oriented portfolios. However, it’s important to consider the potential risks. Amazon’s growth could slow down, and it might underperform during times of economic uncertainty. There’s also the question of whether its significant investments in AI will pay off. You should definitely weigh these risks. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AMZN stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Six months into the second Trump administration, it has become clear that now is the time of con men. Scams and snake oil proliferate, as do the hucksters who promote them. Before Mike Huckabee became our ambassador to Israel, he advertised Relaxium, an herbal supplement whose makers falsely pledged it would help a restless nation sleep. Other supplement-makers see a champion in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who not only opposes vaccines but has said the Food and Drug Administration should free the nation from the “aggressive suppression” of dubious vitamins and herbal substances. Kennedy has even hired David Geier to conduct a study into the debunked link between autism and vaccines, though authorities once punished Geier for experimenting on autistic children in a basement laboratory. Like his late father, Mark, Geier believes the puberty blocker Lupron can treat autism and says vaccines caused the developmental condition. Neither claim is true, but in the greater Make America Healthy Again universe, facts can be inconvenient. Dubious supplements and false cures have always been part of the quack’s tool kit, but Kennedy and his ilk aren’t limiting themselves to the mere promotion of pseudoscience. They’re attacking scientific research at the same time. Funding cuts and layoffs are weakening major institutions like the National Institutes of Health and the FDA, which were established to monitor our food supply and medicines for safety. The administration has canceled research grants to universities, slowing the pace of innovation. Scientists searching for cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s, various cancers, and genetic diseases say their work is in jeopardy — if it can continue at all. The MAHA war on expertise leaves Americans ever more vulnerable to predators and scams, which in turn exacerbates a much older problem: The quack has too much power and prospers in times of inequality and mistrust. In 2019, the Pew Research Center found 86 percent of Americans felt confident in the work of the country’s scientists. That figure declined during the pandemic, and though it rebounded slightly by 2024, it remains lower than its pre-COVID levels. Behind the numbers are hucksters who prospered during the pandemic thanks in part to Donald Trump himself. Although the president’s first term oversaw the rapid development of COVID vaccines, Trump also told people to inject disinfectant to fight the virus. Grifters peddled ivermectin, a horse dewormer, along with an anti-malarial drug called hydroxychloroquine, which is not an effective COVID treatment. Trump would later tout it at a press conference, leading to fatal consequences for at least one listener. Hydroxychloroquine sounds a lot like chloroquine, a non-pharmaceutical chemical sold to clean fish tanks. An Arizona couple had purchased the substance to treat their koi pond and decided to drink it after tuning in to Trump’s performance. The wife lived; her husband did not. Meanwhile, luminaries like the disgraced televangelist Jim Bakker sold colloidal silver as a COVID remedy. There is no evidence that colloidal silver can treat any physical ailment or that ivermectin has a use beyond the elimination of parasites. Yet people still take them, often to their own detriment. Scott Adams, the right-wing creator of “Dilbert,” recently admitted he had used ivermectin to treat his prostate cancer. It didn’t work, and Adams says he expects to die from the disease this summer. Amy Carlson, the QAnon-adjacent cult leader better known as Mother God, consumed so much colloidal silver that her skin had turned blue by the time she died. Both discovered what scientists and physicians already knew: Quackery may promise good health, but it can’t make good on its pledge. At best, it does nothing; at worst, it kills. Despite this, quacks endure, and so does the risk they pose to public health. If MAHA sweeps the scientific Establishment aside, history suggests a wild and dangerous era awaits. Quackery is at least as old as the United States itself. Frontier life promised all sorts of dangers, and early settlers brought bizarre therapeutics with them to stave off fever and premature death. Unscrupulous apothecaries and makers of nostrums, as quack medicines are sometimes known, discovered a lucrative new market that alarmed professionals with medical training. In The Toadstool Millionaires, historian James Harvey Young quotes one colonial physician who suggested a “licensing system” that would “remove the ‘Shoemakers, Weavers, and Almanack-Makers, with their virtuous Consorts, who have laid aside the proper Business of their Lives, to turn Quacks.’” But profit beckoned, and quacks proliferated for many decades to come, though they achieved no results worth mentioning. In the 18th century, the Connecticut physician Elisha Perkins devised a pair of “metallic tractors,” or rods, that could allegedly cure painful ailments like rheumatism and generated a brief international mania. The Connecticut Medical Society expelled Perkins for nostrum-making, but he persisted, convinced of his own genius. When yellow fever struck New York City in 1799, he went out to treat the sick with a mixture of “marine salt, vinegar, and water” until he inevitably fell ill, died, and was buried in a potter’s field near what is now Washington Square Park. During the Gilded Age, the growth of the newspaper industry, the rise of public advertising, and the construction of railroads coincided with radical social and economic inequality — a complex situation that nostrum-makers could and did exploit. In one extreme case, Henry T. Helmbold spread word of “buchu,” a plant native to southern Africa, along the length of the Union Pacific Railroad. The bold advertising strategy worked, and Helmbold became a wealthy eccentric who enjoyed ruling-class patronage for years. In New York, his “Temple of Pharmacy” boasted “sarcophagus soda fountains, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, monogrammed gas globes, marble floors with the doctor’s initials inlaid in brass, fountains for dispensing perfume, and canary birds tweeting in their cages,” Young wrote. Temple attendants in elaborate uniforms sold buchu to Boss Tweed and John Jacob Astor. The problem? Buchu didn’t work, and Helmbold was an alcoholic. The temple closed, the birds died, and then so did Helmbold, in 1892. Helmbold courted the rich while other quacks pursued the poor. In the years before Helmbold constructed his temple, the Philadelphia nostrum-maker William Swaim sold a “panacea” for use in a city almshouse. Though Swaim said the drug had cured a patient there, the Philadelphia Medical Society eventually concluded the opposite was true: The patient had died. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. observed in the 1840s that quacks, “in trumping up ‘Dispensaries,’ ‘Colleges of Health,’ and other advertising charitable clap-traps,” had used “the poor as decoy-ducks for the rich.” A façade of respectability allowed them to prey on the unsuspecting, however, and by 1906, Congress felt pressured to act. The Pure Food and Drug Act made it illegal to sell misbranded or adulterated food and drugs, and it helped establish the FDA, though quack medicines still appeared on market shelves. The skeptic researcher Joe Nickell wrote in 1998 that patent medicines like Dr. Worden’s Female Pills and Dr. McBain’s Blood Pills were sold by mail-order companies years after the act took effect, and he noted that the later rise of “alternative medicine” could threaten modern generations if left unchecked. Today’s quacks have learned to manipulate various regulatory loopholes to sell fake cures to the masses. Homeopathy is hardly more sophisticated than Dr. McBain’s Blood Pills, but consumers can still purchase bottles of such medicines at Whole Foods. Insurance companies will often cover chiropractic treatment, though the field was founded by a spiritualist who got the idea from a ghost. My brother and I used to giggle at “horny goat weed” in our local gas stations, but the side effects aren’t that funny; it can make the user puke or hallucinate. These days, you can buy it on Amazon. Wealthier consumers may prefer to shop from Goop, which sells a “gemstone heat-therapy map” for $1,049. A bro who tunes in to Joe Rogan may hear of wondrous nootropics like Alpha Brain, created by a Rogan friend; a 2024 lawsuit accused the maker of “deceptive” advertising. The FDA “can’t even require that supplements be effective before they are sold,” KFF Health News reported in February. Medical scams and nostrum-making are still popular — and profitable, too, even though they can be dangerous. In January, a Michigan child burned to death inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber where he had endured 36 futile treatments for ADHD and sleep apnea. Though the United States does not stand alone in its susceptibility to nostrums, its unfettered free market is a bonanza for hucksters. The FDA hasn’t approved the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for conditions like autism and ADHD, but clinics and med spas across the country advertise miraculous effects and remain largely unregulated, which frees them to maximize profits at the expense of consumers. Social media spreads dubious medical claims further than even Helmbold could dream. On Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube, anyone can be a quack or work for one. So-called “alternative medicine” was a multibillion-dollar business in the U.S. before Trump ever took office. Now that he’s back in power, with Kennedy helming public health, we are poised for a new golden age of quackery. Trump is in some respects the quintessential president of the quack. He is a huckster in his own right, as former Trump University students may attest, and pseudoscience can prop up an authoritarian government. Dr. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist and the editor of Science-Based Medicine, has called the MAHA movement “the new Lysenkoism,” invoking a Soviet scientist who rose to prominence during Stalin’s regime. Trofim Lysenko repudiated Darwinism and the emerging field of genetics on ideological grounds, and his unfounded agricultural theories helped Stalin starve millions of people. We’re not there, but quackery still exacts a significant human toll. A nationwide measles outbreak has killed at least two children, but anti-vaccine parents and some doctors have attempted to treat the disease with cod-liver oil, though there’s no evidence that it works. Kennedy has nevertheless promoted the oil as a treatment for measles in his public statements. In May, Trump nominated Kennedy ally Casey Means to be surgeon general, though Means has questioned the childhood vaccine schedule and called researcher Dale Bredesen a “medical hero” — though Bredesen no longer practices medicine, he promotes a complicated diet and supplement regime that he claims can reverse symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Mostly, it’s expensive. People can pay $810 to join Apollo Health, Bredesen’s company, which matches them with a Bredesen-approved physician. The New York Times reported one Illinois couple spent $25,000 to treat Alzheimer’s the Bredesen way before concluding that the Bredesen protocol doesn’t work. Lawmakers thus face a difficult if urgent task, and so do the nation’s experts. Trump won’t be around forever, and he’s making sure pseudoscience will outlast him. The root of the problem isn’t necessarily public ignorance but exploitation. Right now, it’s a predator’s market, and that’s not a coincidence. Without robust public institutions and a health-care system that prioritizes care over profit, mistrust will fester. Americans will lead sicker and shorter lives, and the next pandemic may be even deadlier than COVID. Others will waste money on treatments that don’t work or sacrifice their children to scam artists. Fighting Trump means fighting MAHA and, with it, the quack and the huckster. Rebuilding the federal government and closing regulatory loopholes will cost nostrum-makers some cash, but it’s the only way to make America healthy at last.

Title: Amazon's Lab126 ventures into "Physical AI" with new robotics team
URL: https://www.neowin.net/news/amazons-lab126-ventures-into-physical-ai-with-new-robotics-team/
Time Published: 2025-06-05T07:54:01Z
Full Content:
Amazon has announced that it’s forming a new agentic AI team within its secretive hardware research and development division, Lab126, to begin work on physical AI. Specifically, the company is looking to develop an agentic AI framework for use in robotics, which could start to impact blue-collar jobs, especially at its warehouses. Agentic AI is one of the latest developments in AI, superseding the previous generative AI that took off with the launch of ChatGPT. Agentic AI models are special because they can complete multi-step actions for the user to complete complex tasks. Thanks to all the visual and audio capabilities added to generative AI in previous years, these agentic models can perceive their environment, reason, plan, and act to achieve goals with minimal human intervention. If Amazon can successfully bring agentic AI to robots, they will finally be able to interact with the real world in a way they can’t today, as software running on a computer. Many people are concerned about AI’s impact on white-collar jobs right now, but when Amazon develops physical AI, it will also affect blue-collar manual work. The work is going to be carried out by Amazon’s R&D company, Lab126. It was set up over 20 years ago and has created many iconic Amazon devices, including the Kindle, Fire tablets, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Echo devices, and more. The biggest impact of physical AI developed by Lab126 will be on Amazon’s warehouses and logistics. The company said it wants to create robots that can perform tasks based on natural language instructions. As usual for a big tech company, Amazon claims that these robots will be assistants, but it’s difficult to see how they won’t reduce the need for people. Solely based on Amazon’s plans to automate work in its factories, customers will see an indirect impact from the move through faster deliveries and potentially lower costs. The decision by Amazon to focus on agentic AI in robots is pretty interesting because so far, we’ve mainly been hearing about agentic AI limited to computer applications, such as intelligent web browsers like Opera Neon. Amazon has a reputation for being an efficient company, particularly when it comes to the employment of warehouse workers who are known to have strict restroom breaks. Creating robots that can help speed up warehouse activities will further boost efficiency at the company and could potentially reduce its costs and improve safety. The beginning of work on physical AI is just the next evolution of AI that we could start to hear about in the coming months and years. As agentic AI gets better, companies will be looking to see what they can advance next and physical AI may be where they choose to go next; it certainly seems like this is what Amazon has settled on in this move. If Amazon’s physical AI doesn’t lead to mass layoffs of warehouse employees, it could drastically boost worker safety. Employees could potentially be less fatigued from moving around so much, which could lead to better concentration and fewer accidents. Right now, Amazon claims that these robots will only be assistants and not replacements. While Amazon will certainly be a leader in physical AI, given its massive wealth to throw at the problem, once the technology is available, it will likely be available for sale to other businesses to use, too. While it’s a notable development, it still sounds like Amazon is in the early stages of developing these physical AI systems, given that it has only just set up the team. We also don’t know what specific products Amazon is planning to build or the timelines for deployment. Ever since generative AI came onto the scene, there has been discussion of AI safety. With AI moving into the physical world, it will also bring up discussion about the safety concerns. Current measures are mainly concerned with AI software running on computers, not when it interacts physically with the world. Finally, and probably the biggest concern, what will these “assistants” do to people’s jobs? Companies will likely find themselves bringing in fewer new hires initially, but it could also displace people from their jobs. Source: CNBC

Title: AI Could Turn Democrats Into the New Welfare Class

Time Published: 2025-06-05T00:28:38Z

The New York Times’s jeremiad last week about AI’s impact on entry-level jobs — particularly in tech — merely underscores trends that have been clear for well over a year. Silicon Valley firms have been slashing jobs despite record profits, and since 2022 California has actually shed positions in the information sector. An astonishing 82% of millennials fear AI will drive down their compensation. They have every reason to be concerned. This trend could create a political storm of massive proportions. In recent decades the Democratic Party has been able to compensate for its ebbing support among blue-collar workers by winning over college-trained professionals. Almost all college-educated professionals — excluding those in the military and airline pilots — lean overwhelmingly Democratic. College degrees, particularly graduate ones, are among the strongest indicators of a Leftist tilt, yet are becoming ever less salient in terms of garnering higher salaries. This base is under increased assault, as universities are forced to confront declining enrollments and ever less public approval. At the same time, the supply of entry-level graduate jobs at major firms such as Salesforce, Meta, Amazon and Lyft are dwindling due to the introduction of AI. Google, most notably, has recently laid off 12,000 workers — a number that is expected to grow to 30,000. The damage may be even greater at the grassroots level. Within months of AI’s emergence, freelance work in software declined markedly, along with pay. In a survey earlier this month, two-thirds of business leaders suggested that ChatGPT will lead to large layoffs of white-collar workers over the next five years. Already, new AI programmes are allowing software firms to do without lower-level programmers, particularly new hires. To be sure, Americans without college degrees are not immune to the effects of AI. But in the near term, it’s college professors, administrators, lawyers, accountants, and psychologists — largely Democratic-leaning professionals — who are increasingly in the crosshairs. Even Hollywood, a traditional Democratic stronghold, faces mounting threats: as entertainment becomes more digitised, layoffs have accelerated, and studios find it far easier to shift production to lower-cost regions such as Eastern Europe. Who wins here? It will be those professions that use AI to build things, such as drones, spaceships and robots. These firms are not as heavily concentrated in places like Silicon Valley, which has largely embraced software, social media and consumer services, leaving its once proud industrial heritage behind. This is a huge opportunity for Texas in particular, since the state has always been oriented towards tangible engineering. Texas may have missed the social media boom, but its industrial legacy has left it well placed to dominate the “deep tech” builder space. This field often requires reliable and affordable energy — something not easy to get in states such as California or New York. Beyond elite AI engineers, the other likely winners may be those in physical, hands-on jobs — mechanics or oil rig workers — that are much harder to automate. AI pioneer Rony Abovitz told me that the big winner in the coming years will be the “sophisticated, technically capable blue-collar worker”. Young people might be better off ignoring Joe Biden’s famous advice to “learn to code” and instead consider trade schools which teach practical, in-demand skills.

Dan Ives, a tech analyst known for his bullish calls on Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla, and the generative AI boom, is offering investors a way to buy into his thesis — literally. On Tuesday, Wedbush Securities, where Ives is the managing director, launched the Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (ticker: IVES), a portfolio of 30 U.S. tech companies selected by Ives and his team for their exposure to AI. The fund trades on the NYSE Arca and carries a 0.75% expense ratio. The ETF includes familiar names such as Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR) — companies Ives has championed as foundational to the next phase of digital transformation. The ETF tracks what Wedbush calls the “Ives AI 30,” a list of companies the company sees as best positioned to commercialize and scale AI across sectors — from semiconductors to cloud platforms to next-gen software. “It’s based on our research,” Ives told CNBC. “As new companies come in, then some companies could come out. This is a living organism, in terms of this AI 30. It’s not static. And that’s a key part of the theme here, because the theme will continue to evolve.” That puts the fund into what Wedbush executives say is a bit of a hybrid category. “We’re kind of walking this line between active and passive,” said Cullen Rogers, chief investment officer at Wedbush Fund Advisers, who is overseeing the ETFs day-to-day operations. “We’re just looking to leverage Dan’s ideas as well as we can in an institutional framework... that gives investors a consistent, predictable structure.” Ives has been among Wall Street’s most vocal AI bulls, describing the moment as a generational investment opportunity. In recent client notes, he’s called AI “the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years” and likened AI chips to “the new gold and oil.” “The AI revolution is the biggest tech theme we’ve ever seen,” Ives told Yahoo Finance. He said he started the ETF “because it’s about the second, third, fourth derivatives of AI playing out, and that’s the important thing for investors.” The launch lands at a time when AI-related stocks are surging. But whether or not the market stays this hot is a big question. “Dan’s track record speaks for itself,” Wedbush CEO Gary Wedbush said in a press release. “He’s been identifying the drivers of tech disruption for years, and the IVES ETF gives investors a chance to follow that insight in a disciplined, transparent way.” Wedbush is betting that the AI rally is far from over — and that the company’s strategy can stand out as the space matures.

Title: Constellation Energy Stock Up On Meta Deal. More AI Energy Plays Ahead

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Big tech’s appetite for energy could means upside for nuclear power stocks ETTERS, PENNSYLVANIA - SEPTEMBER 21: The Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant is seen on September 21, ... More 2024 from across the river in Etters, Pennsylvania. Microsoft and Constellation Energy reached a deal that would restart Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant, which was previously retired in 2019. (Photo by Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images) Data center demand for energy could grow 160% by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs. Constellation Energy runs nuclear power plants that big tech companies are using to run AI chatbots. Since last September, Constellation Energy stock has risen, fallen, and recovered. Talen Energy — which struck a deal now in limbo with AWS — could also benefit from this demand. Shares of Constellation Energy — which contracted to provide Microsoft nuclear power from Three Mile Island, as I wrote in a September 2024 Forbes post — have risen 29% this year, according to GoogleFinance. Will the stock price rise further? There are two reasons to consider doing so: I would hesitate to buy Constellation Energy because the shares have been volatile and analysts estimate they are somewhat overvalued. "It's clear that we're in a whole new ball game on cost," Constellation CEO Joseph Dominguez said on a company earnings call last month, reported Reuters. “Certain natural gas plant builds, for example, have tripled in cost over the last decade in some cases,” he added. Nevertheless, demand for nuclear power is likely to grow and other providers — such as PacifiCorp — may be worth considering. Generative AI fueled significant demand for energy in 2024 and is likely to grow considerably by 2028. Last year data centers used 200 terawatt-hours of energy — between 27% and 38% of which powered AI-specific servers, according to the Department of Energy. That is about the amount of power Thailand uses in a year, noted the DOE. By 2028, much more energy will go to data centers. Between 2024 and 2028, data center consumption of U.S. electricity may triple, from its current 4.4% to 12%, DOE notes. AI’s share of that energy will rise substantially. Between 2024 and 2028, the power going to AI-specific purposes will rise at a 32.6% average annual rate to 244 terawatt-hours per year — the midpoint of a forecast range between 165 and 326 terawatt-hours per year, DOE estimated. Nuclear energy accounts for a fraction of the U.S. energy supply but that is expected to grow in the future. Today, only 20% of electricity here comes from nuclear — representing “a fraction of AI data centers’ operations,” reported MIT Technology Review. While Meta, Amazon, and Google have joined a pledge to triple the world’s nuclear capacity by 2050, additional nuclear capacity could take “years, perhaps decades, to materialize,” MIT Technology Review noted. Last September, Constellation Energy announced a deal to supply nuclear energy to Microsoft — and on June 3, Meta inked a very different nuclear deal, according to CNBC. Constellation — which owns the Three Mile Island facility in Pennsylvania that suffered an accident in March 1979 — signed a 20-year agreement for Microsoft to pay the nuclear energy leader about $16 billion, last September, noted my Forbes column. This week Meta signed a 20-year agreement to buy “about 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois,” beginning in 2027, CNBC reported. While terms of the deal were not disclosed, Meta will not use the power for its data centers. Instead, Constellation — which will expand Clinton’s output by 30 megawatts — will keep supplying the power to the regional grid while contributing to Meta’s “goal of 100% clean electricity,” wrote CNBC. Before Meta’s commitment, Clinton was at risk of closing in 2027 when its zerio emissions credit expires. “We are proud to partner with Meta,” Dominguez told CNBC. “They figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards,” he added. Meta also expressed enthusiasm for this arrangement. “Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Meta head of global energy Urvi Parekh said. “We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.” It is not all good news for Constellation investors. The company’s stock rose sharply on the announcements of these deals — yet it has fallen after recent earnings reports. Moreover, analysts view the stock as somewhat overvalued. For example, after the September 20 announcement of its deal with Microsoft, the stock rose 22%, according to SeekingAlpha. Moreover, the deal with Meta propelled Constellation’s shares up 15%. However, Constellation has lost value after recent earnings reports. For the June 2024-ending quarter, the company fell short of earnings and revenue expectations, noted my Forbes post. While the company’s third-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations and raised its full-year outlook — which it had not done in more than a year — Constellation’s stock price fell after a disappointing regulatory ruling, according to MarketWatch. To be sure, Constellation’s fourth quarter 2024 report featured better than expected revenue and operating income — however, the stock lost about a third of its value in the six weeks following the report. Finally, Constellation stock fell in May after reporting disappointing earnings for the March 2025-ending quarter. Rising costs to build and operate its electricity infrastructure “caused the major U.S. power company to miss Wall Street expectations for first-quarter profit,” noted Reuters. Wall Street considers the stock slightly overvalued. Based on 12 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets, Constellation Energy stock trades slightly above the average price target of $303.20, noted TipRanks. In March 2024, Talen Energy struck a deal to sell for $650 million its Cumulus data center — which is adjacent to a Pennsylvania nuclear plant, reported Data Center Frontier — to Amazon Web Services. However, in November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled to block an interconnection service agreement that would have allowed Talen to increase the power supplied to the AWS data center co-located with its Susquehanna nuclear plan due to uncertainty about whether it would boost electricity rates, noted Data Center Frontier. Talen’s first quarter report echoed Constellation’s. Higher interest and energy expenses contributed to Talen’s first quarter loss. The utility’s interest costs “jumped 25.4% to $74 million during the reported quarter, while total energy expenses increased by 10.8% to $235 million,” Reuters reported. The absence of gains from the 2024 sale of the Cumulus data center to AWS also diminished Talen’s profit. If Talen can sell more such nuclear data centers to cloud services providers, its revenue, profits and stock price could rise.

Title: Amazon files WARN notice for Reno fulfillment center closure

Amazon has filed notice with the state of Nevada for employee layoffs as the company moves forward with closing its Reno fulfillment center this summer. A WARN notice was sent by Amazon on Monday, June 2, and posted by the Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation on Wednesday morning. It confirmed that it will close its facility at 8000 N. Virginia St. on Aug. 2, 2025. WARN notices are 60-day notifications required by law when a company enacts massive layoffs. The notice is named after the 1989 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. WARN notices are required during: The Reno Gazette Journal first confirmed the planned closure of the Reno facility with Amazon in October. At the time, the facility employed about 500 people. Today, Amazon’s Reno fulfillment center has about 325 people working at the site, according to the company. Amazon has also provided transfers to more than 100 employees. “As we wind down operations at our Reno fulfillment center, we’re working closely with all affected employees to provide the latest information about transfer opportunities at other Amazon facilities in Reno and elsewhere,” an Amazon spokesperson told the Reno Gazette Journal. “For employees who choose not to remain with Amazon following this closure, we’re offering support through this transition.” Amazon also confirmed that it still plans to open a new same-day delivery facility in south Reno. Amazon filed a building permit in September for a new facility at the 580 South industrial center just across Mount Rose Highway from the Shayden Summit Reno mall. Employees affected by the closure of the Reno fulfillment will be given advance notice about job opportunities at the new same-day delivery center, according to Amazon. Construction of the new south Reno facility, however, has been pushed back from its initial late 2025 completion date. Work on Amazon’s new south Reno facility is expected to continue through 2026, Amazon confirmed. Amazon first opened its RNO4 fulfillment center in Reno in 2015. At the time, the 630,000-square-foot facility — which shipped its first package on Jan. 21 — was touted not just for its size but also technologies such as embedded wires that sync with forklifts and allow for the use of very narrow aisles plus a machine that can build on-demand custom-size boxes as needed. In just a decade, however, the Reno fulfillment center is now considered as an older facility and Amazon decided to not renew its lease. The company is also focusing more on increasing its number of smaller same-day delivery centers. “We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where we open new facilities, enhance existing facilities, and close others — including business need as well as how we can best improve the experience for employees, customers and partners,” said Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly at the time. “With our lease expiring at our facility in Reno, we’ve made the difficult decision to end operations out of that site next year.”

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is ‘motivated by fear and guilt,’ biographer says

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang may run one of the most important companies in the world, but he can’t credit his success to the power of positive thinking. “I think the most surprising thing about Jensen is that he’s almost totally driven by negative emotions,” said Stephen Witt, who spent hours interviewing the Nvidia co-founder for his book, “The Thinking Machine.” “This is his fuel. This is his gasoline, [and it’s] what makes him go is this anxiety,” he told CNBC. According to Witt, Huang fears Nvidia (NVDA), which is valued at more than $3.3 trillion, could fall apart at any time. Witt said he was surprised by how much negative emotions seem to motivate Huang, who “becomes very uncomfortable and nervous when things are going well.” Huang does best when acting like Nvidia is “on the brink of failure at all times,” Witt said. “This is the narrative he generates around himself — that he could fail at any time and be disgraced. And this is what motivates him.” Witt continued: “Jensen, of course, is an obvious, huge go-getter, but it’s all coming from this place of almost beating himself up for not working hard enough all the time. I didn’t expect to see that.” While that mindset might sound exhausting, it has worked well for Huang, who according to Forbes, is the 16th richest person in the world in 2025. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 with two colleagues, and steered the company through an period where it almost had to close up shop just a few years later. Now, the chipmaker has never been more prolific. It reported $44.1 billion in revenue for the fiscal first quarter this year.

Title: Cuts to USAID severed longstanding American support for Indigenous people around the world
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/06/04/indigenous-affairs-doge-cuts/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T15:52:16Z

By GRAHAM LEE BREWER NEW YORK (AP) — Miguel Guimaraes Vasquez fought for years to protect his homeland in the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade, even laboring under death threats from drug traffickers. A leader in an Indigenous rights group, Vasquez said such efforts were long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which spent billions of dollars starting in the 1980s to help farmers in Peru shift from growing coca for cocaine production to legal crops such as coffee and cacao for chocolate. The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets. But the Trump administration’s recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights. “We don’t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,” said Vásquez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. “We think the situation is going to get worse.” Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. “We really needed those resources,” he said. When Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world. USAID’s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change. That included Vásquez’s organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. Vásquez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration. In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs. “Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in March. “Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.” Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation. Former USAID employees said political pressure from the U.S. often kept foreign governments from violating some Indigenous rights. In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It’s now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government. The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country’s agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. “The impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,” Vásquez said. The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE’s cuts to USAID a “mindless” setback to years of work. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. USAID’s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger. One of the most recent additions to USAID’s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy. Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank. “That provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,” Rieser said. “That has now been silenced.” That adviser position remains unfilled. Vy Lam, USAID’s adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden’s administration. He said concepts such as “free, prior and informed consent” — the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights — were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy. One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments. For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation. “We had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,” Lam said. U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area. In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses. Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N. At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy. In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant. In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings “are actual victims of human rights violations,” Flores said. “For someone who’s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it’s really just an injustice.” This story was published in partnership with Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change.

Title: CrowdStrike Stock Is Sinking, But Analysts Are Staying Bullish

Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD) are falling Wednesday after the company's revenue forecasts came in short of estimates, but analysts are staying bullish on the cybersecurity software maker. Analysts from Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Oppenheimer all raised their price targets for CrowdStrike to $470, $450, $520, and $520, respectively. Of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 25 call CrowdStrike a "buy," while four others rate it as a "hold," with an average price target of $488.39. Bank of America analysts, lifting their price target but downgrading the stock to "neutral," said they "favor CrowdStrike's fundamentals and growth prospects, but believe the valuation leaves only limited upside from the current level," adding that they expect revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of this year but slow in the coming years. UBS analysts, retaining their $545 price target as one of the most bullish on Wall Street, said they are "inclined to look past some of the near-term revenue headwinds from the company’s outage-related discounting program," which pressured first-quarter revenue and CrowdStrike's second-quarter forecasts. Analysts from Deutsche Bank said they are "bullish on CEO George Kurtz's articulation of how AI is expanding the attack surface and driving the need for better cyber defense (and thus more CrowdStrike)." However, they added that they "remain on the sidelines given valuation and our concerns for consolidation cyclicality." CrowdStrike shares were down 4% in recent trading to roughly $466, but are still up about 37% since the start of the year.

Elon Musk Nick Gillespie | 6.4.2025 11:00 AM HD Video Download Today's guest is Helen Lewis, a British journalist and podcaster who is a staff writer for The Atlantic. Her new book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, and it explores how the definition of what it means to be a genius has changed radically over the centuries, how it became linked to all sorts of weird biological theories, and how Elon Musk has come to personify genius in our time (and whether his failure at the Department of Government Efficiency spells the end of his genius moment). Lewis and Reason's Nick Gillespie also talk about The Beatles; William Shockley, who turned to racial science after winning a Nobel Prize for helping to invent the transistor; and her notorious 2018 interview with Jordan Peterson for British GQ, which has racked up over 70 million views. 0:00— Introduction 1:36— The Genius Myth 7:20— How dead geniuses fueled national myths 11:30— Thomas Carlyle and the Great Man theory 18:18— Are inventions inevitable? 23:22— Francis Galton and eugenics 33:35— Pro-natalism and declining fertility rates 37:14— William Shockley 48:00— Shakespeare and The Beatles 57:22— Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and the gender dimensions of genius 1:03:50— Lewis' Jordan Peterson interview 1:07:18— Germaine Greer and second wave feminism 1:11:05— The gender debate in the UK vs US 1:14:14— Elon Musk's rise and fall? 1:20:57— Do geniuses have second acts? Upcoming events: This is an AI-generated, AI-edited transcript. Check all quotes against the audio for accuracy. Nick Gillespie: Helen Lewis, thanks so much for talking to Reason. Helen Lewis: Thank you for having me. Let's start with the obvious question. The book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, which is a great subtitle. But why did you write The Genius Myth? Do you know what, it's one of those things where it's evolved over time, so I may be now lying to myself about why I wrote it. But I did have a conversation with a friend a couple of years ago about the idea that—he has always said that genius is a right-wing concept, which I thought was a really interesting idea because it's about the individual over the collective. It's about people with sublime achievement who are not part of the common throng. And I thought that was interesting. I thought, well, I hear loads and loads of left-wing people use it very casually, and I don't think they're accepting this kind of idea behind it. And then that made me think, well, hang on a minute, what other ideas are kind of being smuggled in in that little word? And that's where the book kind of came from. That's fascinating. And it puts me in mind—the book is fantastic. I mean, it is a great read. It's better than 99 percent of novels I read. And I love—it's a series of stories about kind of crazy people and the people, including all of us, who enable them. But part of what you talk about in The Genius Myth is that being a genius meant radically different things in different eras. Explain in ancient Greece—and I don't know why we care about what ancient Greece thought about anything—but the Greeks talked about having genius, or being a genius meant that you were possessed with a visiting spirit. Can you explain what that means? Yeah, you have a genius—that's the original sense of it. You're visited by this spirit, and you know, it might be the muse of poetry speaks through you, or the muse of history. And they called it furor poeticus, furor divinus—divine fury. And I think that captures something really well. I don't know if you would describe yourself as a genius, Nick, but most of us wouldn't. But you must have had moments when you've sat down— No, very few people have defined me as a genius, so thank you. But you might have had times when you sit down to write a piece or do some piece of work, and it just clicks. Something just feels really good. And I think most writers probably spend most of their life kind of chasing that dragon for the rest of the time. You go, 'when will it come back?' And that's what writing should feel like, and most of the time it's just a kind of grind. So I think they did a very good thing then in capturing something that we've all felt to some extent. There are moments that work. You talk about how, particularly in the context of things like pop music and whatnot—and this is certainly true for writers and novelists in particular—you go on a streak where you are just performing at a higher level. I want to get into an argument about the Beatles for any number of reasons. It's independent of you—I have this argument every morning. But when you look at somebody like Paul McCartney, who you talk about in an interesting way, he's got to understand that whatever he's been doing for the past 40 years is not what he did for that 5- to 10-year period. He was on. So you go from that classical understanding of genius as a visiting spirit or something is speaking through you—which now is almost always the province of serial killers, right? I guess I had the dog talk to me, and it told me to kill me. They're the last classical geniuses in this tattered world. But then in the Renaissance things shift—the Renaissance and the early modern period. How does being a genius change in that period? Maybe even a little bit later than that, because the thing about the Renaissance is always that the word comes from rinascita—rebirth. So the idea was that they were, as they saw it, bringing back the classical tradition. And it was kind of quite imitative—you were trying to learn these things about proportion and form. Well, I don't want to get sidetracked. I'm just going to say yes—they were smuggling what they wanted to do by saying, "What we're really doing is merely bringing back these eras of former greatness." There's the American Renaissance in American literature, which was created in the 1940s about the pre–Civil War period. And I believe there's a racial journal now called American Renaissance, which—they want to rebirth things. So in this early modern period redefinition of genius, what's going on? Then you get this very, very important book that I had to say I didn't really know about, which is Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists. And it is a group biography of—I have to say, all the artists that I would have known growing up because they were also Ninja Turtles, like Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo. But there is a sense that that was a period of a kind of burst of creativity, and he puts them together in this kind of pantheon. And it's one of the first times that you begin to see, in a really systematic way—this is what I mean by the genius myth. These are stories that we tell about people who are innovators or scientists or artists. So you have, for example, the story of Leonardo da Vinci. And the myth that's imposed on him is that he couldn't settle on anything. He had a kind of—an uber level of ADHD. He was designing the helicopter, then he wanted to learn how to paint directly onto a wall using tempura, then he was doing something else. He was kind of a scatterbrain. We have all met that person in our first semester in college as well—who's just so brilliant. Obviously Leonardo accomplished a few things, as well. It's true—not all of the people that you meet in the first semester at college go on to paint the Mona Lisa, or anything like it, sadly. But what I was getting at is that the Mona Lisa wasn't really the Mona Lisa until centuries after it. Until it got stolen. This is one of my favorite things in all of it. It's the same way that Shakespeare died a respectable playwright, but he didn't die the guy that we should enthrone forever as the crowning jewel of English literature. That really a century later. And exactly the same thing with the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa was—and I'm going to be really rude here and say—quite a sludgy gray and green painting, and not seen as the crowning achievement of the Renaissance by any means. It gets stolen in the 1920s and ends up in Italy. And it becomes—actually, as lots of these things do—about national myths, because Leonardo was Italian or proto-Italian, but he was working for most of his life in France. So it becomes a kind of 'Who owns this great genius?' and 'Therefore, who should have the Mona Lisa?' And then it becomes a kind of inter-country fight. It's also great because, in the United States in particular, Italians have always claimed Christopher Columbus. But now many of us Italian Americans are like, "Oh, maybe he was working for Spain, and maybe he is a Jew, so forget it. We don't need Columbus anymore." He's not The Sopranos… But da Vinci is one model of a Renaissance genius. Talk about Michelangelo or some of the others. The person categorizing them said, "OK, well, there are different gradations." He seemed very much like a boy with a bunch of Pokémon dolls or something where he's rank ordering them things like that. Yeah, well, he definitely had a bias. He had a pro-Florentine bias. So he's quite rude about Titian, who was born—I think— Venice or the Alps. But he kind of gets relegated to second status because he's not from the right place. But Michelangelo, he uses as a different example, which is something you find all the time in genius myths: which is someone who had to struggle. So that's turned into a story about how hard it was to paint the Sistine Chapel, and how he had to design all the stuff you'll hear if you go on the tour of the Sistine Chapel. The other thing that you will know from visiting the Sistine Chapel is that it's a lot. It's quite—it is a statement, is it not? Yeah. And I think that's kind of fascinating too—that you have to have a level of ambition. The film critic called it white elephant art. Which he didn't intend as a compliment—these films that kind of announce themselves as a masterpiece. And I think that actually is also quite pertinent to this. The fact that Ulysses by James Joyce is very hard to read—not an enjoyable novel in the conventional sense—is actually taken as being a sign of its genius. The fact that the Sistine Chapel is big…if he'd done that much individual painting and separated it out by canvases, we wouldn't find it quite so impressive as this one—you know, what's that German word? Kunstkammerwerk—you know, the kind of the whole thing is it. You have that word written on your computer, and you use it in every conversation that you ever have. That's true. I do, actually. Yeah, you've rumbled me. But you know what I mean—like that idea of the kind of… You still see it now when you have like, oh, Birdman, it's filmed like it was in a single shot, or The Revenant, oh it only filmed in natural light, or Tom Hanks really lost all the weight for Cast Away, or Charlize Theron made herself ugly for Monster. These are kind of—there's a price to greatness. I like the movies where people gain weight, because anybody can lose weight, right? If we may jump forward a little bit—and I want to skip over him a little bit, both because he deserves to be forgotten, but I want to get to a later figure in Victorian England—but Thomas Carlyle pops up a couple of times in your work. And he is kind of the modern conceptualizer, right, of Great Man Theory, which is related to genius but it's not quite the same thing. Life writing takes form, and then you get the Industrial Revolution and capitalism. And what you then get is genius really as a marketing tool. So, if you're an artist in the 14th century, what you need is a rich aristocratic patron. If you're an artist in the 18th century, 19th century—well, actually, at this point there'd be things like, you know, gallerists start arriving, things like newspapers arrive, mass media arrives, and you might therefore be able to brand, basically. But what's interesting is that most of the time, or at least at that point, it seems to be less the person selling themselves as a genius, and they have a Boswell—or they have somebody around them who is writing them up as, like, "Oh, this is the real guy," like a hype man. A Flavor Flav. Yeah, everybody needs an 18th century Flavor Flav. Yes, it's true. But then you have somebody like Thomas Carlyle, who, you know, very much of a… in the context of his time, it's not like he was a right-winger. And he hated capitalism, certainly. And he hated all of the liberal economists who actually thought that Irish people and Blacks in Jamaica were human in the same way he was. But how does he talk about Great Man Theory, and how does that kind of add to the genius lore before it gets kind of quantified and mathematized later in that century? Yeah, he has this line, which I'm going to mangle, but it's something like, "The history of the world is, at root, only the history of great men." And that was very in keeping with a certain type of patrician Victorian thinking—that you just needed these once-in-a-generation personalities. One of their references would have been someone like Napoleon Bonaparte, the great French general. And I think there's a lot to that argument—that actually, the military decisions that Napoleon made at the times that he made them changed the history of Europe. He was a consequential figure. In the same way that now The Atlantic just ran a cover story on Donald Trump that said he's the most consequential president of the 21st century. I do think it's a reasonable point to say that some people are kind of hinge points in history. I was gonna make a joke about like, what's his competition so far though? You know, it's—zombie Abe or whatever. And you thought—"No, I love Obama and I would never say anything mean about him." Well, I know. I said, unfortunately, from my stupid libertarian point of view, I see an immense continuity between George W. Bush, Obama, Trump I, [Joe] Biden, Trump II. And it's not a good continuity. But, you know, this is part of what you're talking about when you talk about The Genius Myth—you're not saying everybody is exactly the same, and it's just a social construction that Leonardo gets called a great artist, but actually anybody around him was as good. But it is this storytelling and kind of creating this sense that these people are the limit of everything that we're doing. But with Carlyle—so Carlyle—I guess in a way systematic thinking— this is what the Enlightenment was about. And to some degree, the Renaissance—it hadn't quite got there. And you certainly get there with somebody like [Karl] Marx and [Freidrich] Engels, where they kind of say, actually it's the system. It's the base—typically the economic base—that actually determines everything else. So we might forgive Carlyle this one thing of not really understanding. Oh, I totally forgive him because, you know, what's the easiest thing to do is to go, "Actually, it's both," because it obviously is both, right? Some people do make decisions, but also they are products of fundamental forces that are in society. And I guess—now let me, because I outed myself on my libertarian podcast show as a libertarian—maybe it's people like Adam Smith who started to talk about how things don't just happen. There are a lot of kind of occult forces, invisible hands and whatnot, that create order among seeming chaos. And you could extend that to individuals. I feel like this is a big part of your life's work—the meta story that you tell now—which is just that it's a mix of both. It's circumstance and it's individual effort. And that should in no way ever be controversial, but it seems like it constantly needs to be relearned. Absolutely. Because you bring up Carlyle, and he was writing defensively. That's what I didn't really realize until I looked more at that stuff. I sort of assumed everybody in the Victorian era was swanning around going, "Of course the thing is that just a couple of men changed the world." But no—he was writing to defend that idea against what he saw as the kind of forces of egalitarianism. There's a fantastic book called How the Dismal Science Got Its Name by David Levy, which is a study mostly of how Carlyle and other people like him treated the Irish in popular culture and academic discourse basically in the long 19th century. And they were mad that people were saying, "No, actually the Irish are pretty much like the rest of us. They follow incentives. They're not all gorillas or chimpanzees." And that's why Carlyle named the dismal science "the dismal science," because he said that was its main truth—that all humans respond similarly to incentives. What a dismal science that we're not somehow more elevated than the lower order. That's great—to accidentally coin a really great phrase like that when you're trying to be rude. Yes, right. But the point I try to make in the book is that we always end up coming back to Great Man Theory—even people on the left—because we want stories. And stories demand protagonists. Frankly, your biography of Napoleon is going to sell a lot better than your book about agrarian upheaval in France in the 18th and 19th centuries. It's just more interesting to have… You know, when you write a screenplay, the first thing anyone will ever tell you is you have to have a protagonist and they have to be active—they have to make decisions. That's how our minds want history to kind of work. But there's a brilliant paper that I reference in the book from 1922, about "Are Inventions Inevitable?" And the list that they have of the number of things that got invented simultaneously—the most obvious one is the telephone, right? Two people came up with the telephone, and only one of them gets the credit. I write about Edison—Thomas Edison—later in the book. And everybody had the idea for the light bulb. Every man and his dog had that idea because it's quite a simple conceptual idea. What they couldn't do for 100 years was manufacture it and reliably make it work. And the real genius of Edison, if he had it, was, I think, the New York City power grid. But again, that's just not as compelling a story as "Man invents light bulb" that you can see and hold in your hand. And Edison, then—and you point out that he ended up in a fight that he lost. I mean, he lost a lot of his invention battles overall. He was a proponent of direct current, and alternating current won out and ultimately kind of swallowed a lot of his activity. And with Edison, I mean, there's always the fascinating concept of Edison versus Tesla. So you have Edison as one kind of genius, and then Tesla as another—crazy, more romantic genius, because he ended in failure. Do you know, my favorite anecdote is the fact that Tesla walked out of Edison's lab—where he worked for a while—because they had a bet, which Tesla won, and then Edison got really grumpy about him. And I just think this is fascinating because—I don't know if you know this—a couple of months ago, the podcaster Sam Harris told the story. He had a bet about deaths during the coronavirus pandemic with Elon Musk, and Sam Harris won. And then he said, "So, where's my—pay up, son?" And then Elon Musk kind of just got weird—kind of grumpy—and ended their friendship. I like that. That is a great way for Sam Harris to call himself a genius. —is to call himself Tesla. But it is also interesting that, in the book, I had already made this comparison between Edison and Elon Musk—both in the sense of the style of invention they do, their talent for publicity, but also the ego, frankly, that has made them want to play the public role of an inventor. And I think that's where the bet story really comes from. Neither of them likes to be beaten or humiliated. They were both schemers—not ivory tower scientists happy to do their own thing and let the chips fall where they may. They both want to be out there in the world selling themselves. And so that echo was very pleasing. Yeah. And we'll talk more about Musk at the end, I think—or toward the end of this conversation. But Edison also was—he really did work long hours, but he also did what Benjamin Franklin called "visible industry." Like, he made sure you knew. How did you know Edison worked 24 hours a day? Because he told you every time he saw you, or he had people in the press who were either sycophants or on his payroll or whatever, who were telling people. It's not clear that he ever said that creativity or genius is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration, but that captured the image that he was pushing. Oh yeah. I mean, I've got actually—I think more respect for Edison as a businessman and as a marketer than I had when I came in. But you're right, because everyone wanted the myth to be that they were kind of—you know, the easiest mark is somebody who wants to believe what you're selling them. And everybody wanted to believe that he was this American Prometheus. You know, he was stealing fire from the gods. And this is what I mean—to come back to nationalism again. This was a time in which America was the future. Europe was kind of classy, but it was old and hidebound and dying. And America was the new continent of steel and electricity and the railroad and these big barons. And Edison fit that image that America had of itself at that time. So he slotted himself in very neatly. There was a pre-made genius myth for him as an American genius. Right. And if I'm remembering, there was a fantastic series of kids books called Childhood of Famous Americans. All right. And it was the same story told over and over again, but they would change the names and places. And there was one of Edison, and part of his myth is that at some point he was working as a baggage boy on a railroad or something, and he was missing his train, and he gets pulled in by his ears—which caused hearing loss. So he became a great telegraph operator, and his kids were nicknamed Dot and Dash. But a lot of it came from: he was a small kid from nowhere who had bad hearing because of this industrial accident, and then he becomes the greatest inventor of all time. And he gets rewritten as well as "Tom" Edison—young Tom Edison, like Tom Sawyer—rather than his actual first name, which was Alva. And that again just speaks to the kind of— The country hasn't been invented yet that's going to promote an "Alva" as their great inventor. Yeah. And there's a famous movie called Young Tom Edison with, like, Jimmy Stewart or somebody playing him. So this gets done again and again. But now let's bring it back to the evil effects of the British on public discourse, and let's talk about Francis Galton. Because what is interesting—you have the geniuses themselves who become public either because somebody writes about them or they're creating their own myth. But then you have somebody like Francis Galton, who helped kind of quantify—or tried to quantify—what genius meant, and also why it's hereditary and why it persists in certain types of people but not others. Explain who Francis Galton is. He was a really brilliant dilettante—from the time when you could just skip around and come up with lots of different things. He tried to create a beauty map of the British Isles and work out where the women were hottest. I mean, very much actually the precursor of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook in that respect. But was he a lifelong bachelor? He definitely was childless, right? He married, yes, but I can't detect any real enthusiasm for women—or, indeed, any other people at all. Did he marry—did he fight? Like, he was like, "The Orkney Islands have the hottest babes, so I'm going there," or something? No, I think it was—I think it was an arranged marriage. There's a bit in his memoir of his essentially like gap year, where he goes to Africa. One of the chieftains offers him a woman as a "temporary wife," and he declines because she's covered in— that orange pigment, and he doesn't want to get it on his white linen suit. And it's just the sort of most Englishman-abroad kind of colonial power. That's pretty amazing.You have a lot to be ashamed of. OK, thank you. I'll take that one actually. He was also the half-cousin of Charles Darwin. He came from this very storied family in the 19th century, and he therefore was familiar with the idea of evolution by natural selection. You know, this was the idea that survival of the fittest—that people passed down something that now we think of in terms of genes. They didn't have that kind of biological basis to it initially. But he was very interested to think, well, hang on a minute—you can breed dogs in all these different ways. You can breed cattle. Maybe we could breed humans. And this is what I mean about him not showing really any kind of… It just doesn't make sense… Right. Him not showing any kind of fellow feeling for other humans. It was like, "Where could this possibly go wrong? I'm sure this won't have any bad consequences whatsoever." And of course, it did, right? Because he coined the term eugenics, which is from "good birth," essentially, and then dysgenics—which you hear a bit about today. He wrote this book called Hereditary Genius, in which he tried to work out how frequently genius and high achievement occurred in the population and how it was passed down. And people were kind of slagging it off from the very beginning. There's a great dunk of it from a Victorian writer at the time—because he works out that there's a whole family of judges, and he essentially posits the existence of a kind of hereditary judginess. And someone else calls them a "snug little galaxy of jobbers," which I think is right. Just the idea that actually, if you're a judge and your nephew wants to be a judge, then there may be other ways by which that happens rather than pure genetic inheritance. But that's a very influential book among a whole generation of statisticians, because he was a brilliant statistician. And they were also heavily influenced by eugenics. Can I ask was he actually a brilliant statistician, or was he just really novel in what he applied statistics to? Like, he measured a lot of stuff and then said, "OK, well, it means this," but. I mean, the question is— —have concepts like standard deviation, correlation, things like that—they come from his thinking and his work. So he's there right at the birth of this discipline as an academic one. So I think you can say that he was brilliant. And to go back to the idea of, like, do individuals create inventions or do larger forces produce them—is he, as England is moving out—or as the modern world, certainly Europe, is moving out—of kind of inherited aristocracy, he provides a rationale for why the ruling class deserves to be. And this is more of a Marxist kind of interpretation, but it's that Victorian England had to produce Francis Galton, because otherwise people would be like, "Why am I listening to these people simply because they, when I was born, had more money than me?" Yeah, I think that's very true. And also, he provides an excellent justification for imperialism, which was also a great enthusiasm of England at the end of the 19th— He didn't create it. But then provides a justification for what's happening anyway. Which, yeah, in a lot of social theory—that probably, well, now that I'm thinking about it, might be a better interpretation of a lot of social theory—that it's not leading where society goes, but it's rather kind of explaining why we're doing what we're already doing. Yeah, I think you can say there was a kind of Francis Galton–shaped hole in the discourse, and he popped into it quite neatly to say, "Europeans are of better racial stock than Africans," right? And that was obviously something that white Europeans were very keen to hear at the end of the 19th century. Well, some of them, right? Because it really took a couple more generations to figure out, "OK, well, which…who are the Europeans who are actually European, as opposed to Africa due north?" I mean, by the end of the 19th century, you had people who were like, "Well, the Nordics and the Alpines are OK, but these Mediterraneans, like, nah—they're not really…" Well, that's where we have to flick it over to the Americans really taking up the mantle on that. Because they just went, "Hang on a minute. Polish people aren't quite European. Italian people aren't quite European. Irish people aren't quite European. We mean the Nordics, right?" And that's how our racial laws are going to say that the true descendants of the ancient Greeks, bizarrely. I don't know why the ancient Greeks got away scot-free, despite being from Southern Europe, as being very intelligent. If they were so good, they wouldn't have gone away. I mean, this is what I just—I don't understand. But yeah, you're right. He just becomes a very influential figure in what then develops into eugenics and race science. His name has recently been taken off a lot of buildings at University College London. And it's one of those ones where I think I'm ok with it. You know, I think there are lots of cases for whether—- went too far… Am I remembering correctly—part of his research method was measuring the column inches or the number of mentions in encyclopedias of famous people to kind of— He did obituaries, yeah. And then Havelock Ellis, who was a sexologist, does another book in which he basically gets out a ruler. And this is the problem that always happens with these people—they get completely stuffed by Shakespeare, about whom we know very little, and Jane Austen, who lived a very quiet, boring, blameless life in a parsonage. So the biographical idea that you just—you have a lot of biographical detail and you get written about a lot—completely falters. And then they just end up fudging these supposedly scientific lists. Which is the methodology that Charles Murray used in his book Human Accomplishment, where he looked at reference works and measured column inches. Which I think probably calls more for a Freudian interpretation rather than a mathematical interpretation of what's going on. Right. I think you can say it's all interesting data, but it's not objective scientific data. Because you can measure how someone's reputation has changed over time, but you can't say there's a kind of version of just desserts where the most intelligent people get the most column inches. I think our own media at the moment would heavily debunk that idea. Talk about eugenics briefly, because we're also—and this is in the Muskosphere and Peter Thielosphere and stuff like that—where people are talking about eugenics. It's one thing if you're saying the state is running things and saying, "You can mate with these people but not those people," and things like that. You know, when you are going to Burning Man or you're at the Bohemian Grove and it's a voluntary association, we all are eugenicists. We all practice some form of "good birth," where we choose these people rather than those people. Is there a way to disentangle eugenics from its kind of history? Is there a eugenics which does not immediately—or quickly—devolve into racial sorting and some kind of horrific cataclysm of human suffering? In practice, I think, no. I think in theory, you're right—it doesn't have to go in those directions. And I think actually—again, I think you're kind of alluding to this—most people, when you drill down to it, are softly eugenicists themselves. Most people: A, they choose their partner because they think their partner is attractive and smart and would be a good father or mother—which is itself kind of eugenics. The second thing is that most people are broadly supportive of women having abortions of babies with severe and life-limiting illnesses—even those like Down syndrome that aren't necessarily fatal. So, lots of people think that looking after a disabled kid would be really hard, and people should have the choice to opt out of that. I have this argument with one of my friends, who has written brilliant books about eugenics. And I said, "But that is eugenic." And you just don't want to call it eugenics because, to you, eugenicism is bad. But you support this. And I think that's what I mean about in practice, I think there are things that people do agree with that you could describe as eugenic. But in any kind of organized movement, it is so unbelievably tainted by what happened in California in the '30s—huge amounts of sterilizations of the quote-unquote "feeble-minded"— by what had happened under the Nazis, that no reputable scientist would touch it with a 10-foot bargepole. And I don't really see the need to rehabilitate it in these individual cases. Do you see any—I realize it's a little bit off topic—but we are now, because there is a demographic collapse happening. It's women's fault. Women are having fewer children now that they have more job opportunities. Right, because they're grasshoppers, and they reproduce by themselves. Yeah, it's women's fault, yeah. But throughout the West—certainly in the U.S., but then especially in those old parts of Europe that maybe really aren't European, places like Hungary—there's a big push for natalism. The state needs to pump up the volume of kids being born. And countries like Singapore spend millions—or billions—of dollars a year trying to do that. Is that a form of eugenics as well? Should we be concerned, from a history-of-eugenics point of view, about what happens when the state starts to say, "You need to be having more kids"? I think the main contradiction to that is that we don't have any evidence that it works. Stalin had a medal that was like—if you had 10 kids, you got a medal. Yeah, I think it was six or something, but yeah. I mean, to me, what I consider to be a lot of children. And there have been regimes through history that have tried to—currently, Viktor Orbán in Hungary said very explicitly, "I don't want more immigrants. I want more Hungarians." And he has put in tax breaks for people who have more than three children, reductions on the people carrier, you know. But with negligible effects, from what I can see. Unless you're running a really brutally directive society like China, where you can dictate to people how many kids they have— And that it was more about having fewer. But now it's like, "Please, please, can you—people—start having children again? We've realized this is a demographic problem." And I think that will be harder to reverse than the previous one-child policy. That's the thing that's interesting. And I think actually—oh, I've forgotten her name, the brilliant researcher Alice—and I've just talked to Ross Douthat about this at The New York Times—that actually it's not even just the West. Quite conservative societies in North Africa are also seeing this reduction in birth rates. No, it tracks perfectly with the proxy that I've seen brooded about a lot is the number of years of education women have on average. As that increases, fertility rates decline—always and everywhere. And it's that the world has become more modern, meaning that women have more opportunity and more equality and more education. I know Mexican women in Mexico have more kids than they do in America. They cross the border, and they have fewer kids. And that's not even that big a difference. But everywhere, yeah—it's a global phenomenon. And I think it contributes as a sign of progress, actually. Because it means more people, I think, are making more choices. I think it's a sign of progress. I think it's very hard to square with our current gerontocracies in terms of our political systems. I mean, that's the problem. In Britain having fewer working-age people to support more older people is a problem, when those older people are on unsustainably high pensions and earlier retirement… You know, I have a political ideology of limited government and a basic social safety welfare net that I would love to sell to you right now. The problem isn't that people are getting older; it's that we have unsustainable entitlement programs that we can thank Bismarck for. Oh, right. OK. Yeah, OK—so we've put, so far, the villains of today's podcast as the English and Otto von Bismarck. OK, good to have the enemies list updated. Come on, surely let's argue about the Beatles now, Nick. You've been holding out on me. Yeah, well, before we get to them, I want to talk about William Shockley, who is somebody that I think a fair number of my audience will remember. He encapsulates something perfect—partly because he is related, he's a kind of semi-direct descendant intellectually of Galton. But he is also fantastic because he brings us closer to Silicon Valley. William Shockley won a Nobel Prize for his role—contested as it may be—in developing the transistor. And then he became a—you know, he took that— He was a massive prick. And everybody left his firm, and they went on to found Silicon Valley. That's the short way. That's right. On the business end, he had this great creation, or he was part of a great invention, and then he was such a terrible manager that everybody who worked for him—who were incredibly talented—were like, "Fuck it, we're going to start our own company." And that became modern Silicon Valley. And then he spent the rest of his life, "electronics, who cares, I want to talk about racial differences that are quantifiable." And he is the genius, in a way, who precedes many other figures that we'll talk about, but where he was great at one thing, and then spent most of his time talking about stuff—that is just crazy pants—and it takes away from his luster as a great inventor. Yeah, I was just rereading the interview that he did with Playboy. It was one of those kind of great heyday-of-Playboy, nine-billion-page interviews. And it's just—it's really sad to see somebody who obviously had a great scientific brain, but they've just picked up a load of goo, basically. Like, for example, he didn't—you know, the interviewer talks to him about his decision to donate to the so-called Genius Sperm Bank, which is a kind of cursed idea from the start. But he has no idea that men's sperm degrades with age and that at 70, the old swimmers might not be in the best condition. And he just completely hasn't looked into that. And it's a kind of sad version of someone who obviously had a great and flexible intellect in their youth, and they've just kind of hardened. And I don't know about you, but when I was reading that, it felt like one of those kind of internet–social media–era midlife crises ahead of its time. I'm sure the obvious example is Naomi Klein's book about Naomi Wolf, a great feminist scholar, gets caught out and then drifts into the kind of QAnon sphere Wolf found out on—was it the BBC? Live on radio. She basically had a book that was about gay men. And she said that there were a number of them who were executed for sodomy. And it turned out that the phrase that had been written was "death recorded." And that didn't mean they'd been executed. That meant that they'd had a death sentence and actually most of them had ended up commuted or whatever. But it was just this very embarrassing thing that dented her credibility in the liberal sphere. So she went over to the other side. And here is—I'm going to make—this is an act of genius that I almost certainly won't pull off, because I'm not a genius. But that moment where she is live talking to the interviewer who points that out to her, and she's like, "Oh… oh." I mean, you just see something change. It's almost like having a stroke. It's very similar to the moment—and I believe you mention this in the book—the Peter Jackson documentary about the Beatles, Get Back, when the song "Get Back" comes into recognizable form. Where the Fab Four are noodling around, and then suddenly you hear this classic song come into being. Yeah, it's a live-action shot of somebody who basically—and I think this is exactly what happened to Shockley. Shockley won his Nobel Prize, the career stalled, he couldn't understand what happened to it. He made, I think, one idle comment about IQ and everyone screamed at him. And he did exactly what happens to lots of people now in that situation, where he felt like that was unfair and unjust, and so he kind of did it harder. And he became a provocateur, and he got into this mindset of, "The more that I'm owning the libs, the righter I must be." And I think you just—you see that. I still think you see that now, and I understand it psychologically. Yeah, like you say, "I'm this thing that you know is horrible, and it's like I'm going to be your worst nightmare version." And in the point about Shockley—and this is, I mean, a credit to the book and to your work—is that Shockley was not— here was an ongoing study of IQ and super-smart kids in California that he did not make the cut for. So you have a guy who becomes obsessed with IQ as this thing that is free-floating and independent from all sorts of influences. And you have to—I mean, anybody reading that in the contemporary world would say, "Oh, he became obsessed with IQ because he was a genius, but he was not ratified as a genius in this grammar school or high school study going on in California." I found that very telling. Yeah, that's Lewis Terman's Genetic Studies of the Gifted, and the cutoff point was either 140 or 135 on this particular IQ score. And he claims that his mother got an IQ score of 150, but he was below it. And actually, there was one other Nobel Prize winner, Luis Alvarez, who also didn't make the cut. And the really sad thing is, in that Playboy interview, he says, "Well, you know, I think probably my IQ has gone up a bit since then," which isn't really how it works between being a school kid and being 70, right? But obviously—you can—yeah, I think you're exactly right. When I read that, I thought, oh, there's the chip on the shoulder. That actually, he's had all the success—what more success could you want than having a Nobel Prize if you're in the sciences? But somehow, there's some little bit of him that still feels he's not enough. And actually, if he clings to this idea of superiority through IQ—racial superiority through IQ—that rubs a little bit of salve on that chip. What goes into people who—and I want to get to the Beatles, because I can talk about The Beatles endlessly. And I met Paul McCartney once— Oh, wow! Yeah, as a college kid. So it was quite exciting, and it led to one of the reasons that I no longer like The Beatles so much. Oh, ok? So that's a good tease, right? But to focus on Shockley a little bit—what goes on where you are a genius in this field or this set of fields—manufacturing, science, invention, electricity—and then you say, "Well, fuck it. What I really want to talk about is race and IQ"? You mentioned, like, his career seemed to stall because nobody—literally nobody—wanted to work with him. They were like, "I'm leaving. You cannot lock me in this factory anymore. I'm just going." But how does that happen? Because this is part of what the book is about. We're in a golden age now where if you are really good at making money on Wall Street, or if you are really good at inventing an electric car, if you are really good at making pop music, we really want to hear your thoughts about all of these other fields that you know absolutely nothing fucking about. I know. It's strange, isn't it? I think, yeah, that does seem to me the Shockley story. There is a heavy suggestion that he kind of piggybacked on the precise version of the transistor that won the Nobel Prize—it was really other people's work—and that people in the lab got tired of him being a kind of credit hog. And then he started getting into applying psychometric testing to his employees, which is always a red flag, I would say. If I may—I've never had to take a psychometric job test, or one that presented itself as such, but my father worked for a shipping company and he used to tell this story that I found very funny. It was called Sea-Land, and it kind of popularized containerized shipping in the postwar era. But it was founded by a guy named Malcolm McLean, who was an illiterate son of sharecroppers in North Carolina. And then, at a certain point, when the company got big enough, they were like, "OK, you've got to start taking business seriously." And they had all of the employees take kind of basic IQ tests to see if they were Sea-Land–worthy people. And Malcolm McLean failed it—because he was basically illiterate, and he was not functioning at the higher level. But, you know—so you had this moment in the heyday of scientific management, where a guy who revolutionized shipping would not be hired at his own company because he was kind of retarded. Wow, that's wild. Yeah, so I always— It doesn't surprise me, because I think that, you know, you would always want to have a higher IQ than not. But I think people overrate that—when you're getting way above the average—how important it is versus personality traits like conscientiousness, openness to experience, whatever it might be. So I think I'm entirely unsurprised by that, but your question kind of speaks to one of the things I talk about in the book, which is this idea of galaxy brainlessness. Which is the idea that, "I'm a smart person, all my opinions are smart." And I think it's just demonstrably not true. And the other thing is—I think it's really sad for the geniuses themselves. Because you look at someone like Shockley, and he has his success because his type of intelligence and his breakthroughs interact with a particularly fertile moment in the history of Silicon Valley, right? He had the right brain for the right time. And what often happens to people is that that lasts for a while, and then it goes away. And that is a really traumatic process for them—particularly if they've become kind of high on their own supply, and they believe that they're a superior sort of person. You know, "Why—I'm pressing the gas pedal and the car's not moving forward anymore," and they can't understand it. And that does often, I think, lead people to kind of bitterness and resentment rather than a kind of appreciation of, "Most people don't get one hot streak. Maybe I won't get two, but the one I had was pretty good." So this is a good segue to talk about The Beatles and the music or creativity streaks where either you're hot, and then suddenly you're not. And I guess part of—we have been, I don't know, and I'm assuming broad social trends in Britain are similar to America—but certainly over the past 30 or 40 years, we have been pushing galaxy brain ideas on schoolchildren and things like that. You know, the idea that you have a domain-specific genius or intelligence doesn't seem to be in favor. We talk about general intelligence, and it's kind of like if you're good at one thing, you're going to be good at everything. So—I mean, we're kind of reaping that whirlwind. I'm not even sure I'm using that term properly, but—because people like Elon Musk are told when they're a kid, "Well, you are really smart. You do great on standardized tests, so everything you say—you get an A in every subject." So like, why wouldn't you start talking about fertility or something like that? So let's talk about the Beatles a bit. How did The Beatles—I mean, it's fascinating, you know, Shakespeare and The Beatles are like the two great British exports, right? Yeah, yeah. And I really appreciate your focus on the way that all of this stuff plays into national myth-making and things like that. When you talk to French or German people, they're like, "Yeah, Shakespeare's pretty good, but he's not great." English-speaking people—and Americans, I think, probably love Shakespeare more than English people—because we have spent, you know, a couple hundred years trying to be like, "No, Melville—he's as good, and Walt Whitman." During graduate school, I studied American literature, and it was fascinating—right around the time that the Berlin Wall came down and then the Soviet Union collapsed. And suddenly, Americanists who had been spending 50 years searching for the American Shakespeare were finally like, "Hey, you know what? We don't actually have to worry. Britain is now a minor literature because America is—our literature matters because we're the world power. We don't have anything to apologize for on some level." But roundabout way of getting to the Beatles—like, you particularly talk about how, within the Beatles mythology, John is seen as the kind of genius, and Paul is—you know, he's like the job, right? He's just a hard worker. What goes into that, and why do you pick Paul over John? Well, for a start, I say this slightly incendiary line, which is: I think in terms of their long-term reputation, we're very lucky that it's Paul who's made it to 80, and John is now a hallowed memory. Because I think if John were still around, he'd be an extremely grumpy reactionary—probably doing quite bad tweets. That would be glorious, though. Whereas Paul McCartney has grown into that kind of father-of-the-nation role, and the younger musicians can make pilgrimage to him. Oh, and it's interesting—I'm sorry to interrupt—but I know George Harrison, who's also important in this kind of holy trinity. And you realize, as age goes on, that Ringo is the only Beatle really worth caring about in the long run. But— Ringo is lovely in Get Back, right? One of my friends described him as being like this sort of lovely Labrador. He's actually like a sort of emotional support animal—because he's there, just exuding Ringo energy. He calms everything down because people don't want to have a row in front of Ringo. And they don't want to upset Ringo. And actually, that is an underrated skill in the high crucible of tempestuous creative motion. Well, but George—towards the end of his life, by the '90s—he was grumpy. When Oasis openly paid a compliment to him by talking about "Wonderwall," which is a reference to his first—or near first—solo album, he was like, "Oasis sucks." He hated everybody younger than him. He was grouchy and grumpy. I mean, Oasis's reputation has not stood the test of time, has it, as a… No, I don't think so. They were— They had a lot of concerts. I think that might be an interesting one to see when people have their own music. Well, and they have their own—that's a variation, right, on the genius theme. The brother who writes everything is really the genius. I mean, they're doing the version of The Kinks with Ray Davies and Dave— Right. And two people who hate each other because they've both got something the other hasn't, right? Liam hates Noel for being able to write songs. And Noel hates Liam for being the charismatic frontman. Anyway, but there's a similar version of that with John and Paul, where John is cast in the role of being the rock bad boy. And that's what people kind of want at the time from their singers. Whereas Paul is seen as kind of domestic and managerial and a bit of a boring admin guy. And his songs focus on mundane stuff, whereas John is writing much more surreal and whimsical stuff—and that's seen as more creative. So you see by the end of the breakup that they've been put into those two categories, and that John has got the much more flattering one. But I don't think it would necessarily— —from a kind of romantic demonic—you know, like the Romantics loving Satan. John is that kind of rock creative genius. Yeah, exactly. Untamable, weird, odd. You know, him and Yoko were kind of wandering around filming their bottoms and all that kind of stuff. He's performing a much more obvious genius role. Whereas Paul McCartney has gone to live on a Scottish island, and send his kids to a public school, and wanting to be, quote, "as normal," right? Trying to live as normal a life as a rock star could live. And therefore—one of the things—I was just talking to a playwright last week about the book. And I said, the thing is, people would rate you as more talented if you were just weirder. You're too normal. You should try and cultivate an aura of eccentricity, because people would misread it as brilliance. I want to get to two other points before we stop talking. And I guess the first is: it's called The Genius Myth. Part of it—I can hear people being like, "Oh, you're just putting down anybody who accomplishes things. You are cutting down the tall poppy or whatever." The Canadian band Rush has a great song called "The Trees," which is about how all the maple trees are trying to keep this oak from growing taller than them. And, you know, they were in an Ayn Rand phase when they produced that. The maple leaf must be the regular Canadian, and they just don't want, you know, Rush to become too big. But it's about the myth, you know. How did you become interested in not the things that people do that are interesting, but in the way that it ends up being talked about? I think people in groups are completely fascinating. Because—I don't know about you—but I find it hard enough to understand individual people. The fact that they think in completely different ways to me. And just—things that to me are completely obvious, they just disagree with me on. And it's kind of life's project to be like, "Oh—other people's brains are different." But then you add in the complexity of them being in crowds, and it becomes completely impossible to understand why people do the things that they do. So lots and lots of my writing—about political movements, about social change—focuses on exactly those kinds of weird emergent properties of people in groups. And that's what interested me about this: you don't get to declare yourself a genius. You can try, right? Lots of people have. And quite a lot of them have been cruelly rebuffed. But genius is created by a crowd looking at you and adoring you and hailing you. And therefore, the interesting question is not just to talk about the properties of the people who are being adored, but the properties of the crowd. So I'm always really interested in celebrity—- Yeah, you talk about Elon Musk in the beginning of the book as an argument about what society values, but also what we're willing to tolerate because it's this whole pact. How did we get to a point where we're going to say—and this is an older example—but it's like, "Well, Roman Polanski deserves to fuck any child that he wants because he made Chinatown." I mean, generally, that is the way that people used to talk about it. They used to say that it was— That's how Bernard-Henri Lévy, the great human rights advocate, said it when Polanski was arrested in Switzerland and was going to be deported to the U.S. Yeah, or like, "It's not rape rape," or, you know, all these kind of weaselly things. Or, "It was Philistines"—that's what one French actress said: "You're Philistine," and then this campaign of smearing against him. And you're like, I'm going to stay at this wild position that I don't think it's good to drug and sexually assault teenagers. Just call me a prude, if you will. And to confess to that. He pled guilty and then he fled because he was worried that the plea bargain that was in place might not come through on the terms that he wanted. To talk about the kind of people who helped create the myth—you have a great chapter, and I'm misreading the title because I don't have it, but it's about the widow of the genius. You talk about people like Orwell's wife, but I'm especially interested in talking about Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, who was an artist—plausibly of equal talent, potentially—but she kind of consciously, ultimately played a role of saying, "OK, I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to kind of build up his myth." Can you talk a little bit about that? And also, one of the things that I find fascinating—this is about your work in general—but it's particularly strong in this book— the gender dimension to all of this. Because geniuses—when you think of a genius, you think of a boy genius. You don't think of a girl genius. Oh, the Romantics were quite explicit about this. They thought genius was a male property, but it was a man who had a kind of feminine spirit within him. You know, this was the idea of a poet. But they're not girls. No. It was fae, sort of feminine men—but never butch ladies. No, that was not the same at all. So those roots of the gendering of genius are really, really deep. And I think there's pretty good research that says we're more likely to describe boys as brilliant. That is just an adjective that we apply more readily to men than to women. But is that something relatively recent? And then it becomes hard because in terms of, if we're talking about harder-core patriarchal structures…I had a conversation with Richard Dawkins once where he was talking about various things, and I was just like, "Yeah, it's really weird to me that, like, girls—you look back in human history and girls just couldn't pole vault until about 1985. Is that because of biology?" I grew up in a world, in high school, where girls were not allowed to participate in the pole vault because they couldn't do it. Evolution did not allow them to have the upper body strength to pole vault. How many times do you recognize things that are treated as facts of nature are obviously social constructions and change? And I'm not denying differences between men and women— Oh sure. No, I'm sure women are worse at pole vaulting, right? They do not do as well. It's definitely sex-linked. What I'm getting at is the question of girl and boy geniuses—because we now live in an age where, you know, the equality of sex is certainly under the law. And even in places where testing is used, you know, girls do better in high school, girls get into college more often, they graduate college more often. Are we going to look forward to a future of girl geniuses that are as insufferable as the boy ones? Well, that's the final dream of feminism, isn't it? To be as insufferable as men. Yeah, I don't know—because I think that's a really interesting question. There are undoubtedly women who have really high achievement in ways that they were previously blocked out of. But there's still an open question about whether or not there are sex differences in the kind of selfishness and ambition that's required to be like a William Shockley. Actually—are these traits that we really want to encourage in our children? The kinds of things that make you the Nobel-winning scientist? Or—that's also an interesting question about the fact that science has changed so much. There's very little low-hanging fruit that one person can now do. Most great science projects now are deeply collaborative—often across countries. But it's also about who the crowd wants to hold up as the genius. And I still think that both men and women are more reluctant to idolize women. So I don't think it necessarily will level out, actually. Because again, it's not an objective awarding of a quality—it's not something awarded on merit. It's about why you are celebrating someone—because of what it says about you, or what it says about the qualities you want to stress. So, you know, we definitely do have more women who are celebrated now. And also—the other thing I would say about, to go back to Lee Krasner—my editor made a very good note in that chapter which I incorporated. She has been the benefit of a explicitly feminist genius myth. Which is that feminist historians love the idea of finding overlooked women and lifting them up and celebrating them. You see that with Artemisia Gentileschi, the Renaissance painter. You see it with Krasner. And so there are a new set of genius myths, which are sometimes in themselves quite reductive—the poor, downtrodden woman who never got her flowers during her life, and now we're here, as the historical court of appeal, to make that right. So yeah, there will be some women who benefit from that. But I would doubt that it will level out anytime soon. What kind of pushback do you face when you bring up the social context of the creation of things like genius? Part of what your book is that there's a line or chapter like, "There really is no lightbulb moment." That Edison, tried a million different things, and all these people, etc. But you—for you—you certainly burst into a bigger view when, it was in 2018, when you had that great interview with Jordan Peterson. Yeah, what I like to do is confuse people by getting attacked from a completely different political tendency every couple of years and just switching it up. So, you know, there are people who've spent the last couple of years thinking that I'm this anti-woke conservative. And now I'm going to go through a phase where they think—I think you're right. The people who don't read the book will think this is some misguided egalitarian feminist nonsense that says, "Everybody can be Monet. Everybody can be Einstein. Everybody can be Picasso," or whatever it might be. So yeah, I think that there will be misreadings like that. You can only write the book. You can't force people to read it, tragically. It's a better world where authors cannot force people to read— I was going to say I couldn't read his book, but yeah. Well, he could get you to hold it up, right? And I guess Gaddafi did that too, right? He had his little Green Book—that's all over. I'm sure it's still in the basements of the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi or whatever. But, you know, with that Jordan Peterson interview—what is amazing, like, when it came out, I watched it, and I was like, "OK, this is really—it's just great journalism." I mean, to your credit—what was funny to me, and more clear on a second viewing—is just that you're asking basic questions. And he is a male genius, and he uses ratiocination, he is incredibly learned—but it's like he's about to cry half the time. He is so emotional. Do you think we've entered into a period where men—the kind of male recourse to anger—is now being recognized less as, you know, genius and more as a failure to cope with what's going on in the circumstance? I hope that's true, because I know what you mean—particularly the kind of plethora of those very cruel videos of people having public meltdowns. I think you often see men melting down in public in a way that suggests they've just never learned to process and manage feelings of humiliation or denial, in a way that's quite unhealthy. And I think everybody would probably benefit from working a bit harder on that. But I'm pleased that you picked that up, because I do think it was very funny—because, you know, that was explicitly set up, that interview with Peterson— This was like—if I may make an analogy—this is like when Playboy sent a Black interviewer to General William Shockley. Sending GQ—sending a woman—to interview Jordan Peterson. For their Men of the Year issue. And that's the thing that's very funny, because everybody wanted it to be me—this kind of emotional little lady—and him to be the Great Man of Science loftily delivering his insights. But as you say, I'm there being quite sarcastic, because that's how I brawl. And he's the one who's kind of tearing up. It was actually very gender-nonconforming in that sense. So credit to everyone involved there. He fits into this category. He obviously toiled in the groves in the academy for a long time and had developed a certain kind of expertise and a certain level of reputation. And then when he broke big, now he's giving people tips on how to tie their tie and things like that. Yeah. I was talking to someone who knew him, actually, in Toronto earlier this week. And they said, you know, he was—he was this really great. Like, the research was really good, and the teaching was really good, and his students really liked him. Everybody who knows him from that period in his life is like, "Oh, you were a really great psychology professor, but you are probably not psychologically suited to be an internet commentator." Some people just have hides of inch-thick leather and that sort of thing bounces off of them. But clearly he's somebody who really takes criticism to heart, and it affects him quite deeply. And he's really not cut out for sprawling with people on the internet. Can I ask before—and I promise we'll get to Musk and then I'll let you get on with your day, or tea, or whatever you people are doing in England now—curtsying— —my crumpets —as you drive by… In your previous book Difficult Women, which is excellent—I'm a big fan of kind of second-wave feminism, which now gets read out of context. You read women like Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol, and they're read out of context. Obviously, she shouldn't have shot Andy Warhol. She should have shot Norman Mailer if she understood her own theory. That would've been great. But what I'm saying is, second-wave feminism from the late '60s and early '70s often gets read in a void. So it just seems like these shrieking harpies who are talking about castrating men, etc., and it's always taken out of context. Like, yeah, they were denied entry into universities or jobs, etc. One of the figures you've talked about a fair amount is Germaine Greer. Talking about Norman Mailer—I mean, if you ever watch the live debate, she just rocks. She throws her fox fur stole over her shoulder and starts talking about building cathedrals in this über-academic way. I mean, it's… oh, I love it. Yeah. No—I mean, you could power all the energy needs of the developing world with the sexual tension… It is really quite something. Germaine Greer, does she fall into a problem of—she was hot, she had a moment. Do you think her thought isn't on a hot streak anymore? It's kind of a amazing because she helped define, certainly in England, second-wave feminism, and now she seems to be hated by most feminists. How does genius age? Oh, I don't think that's true in Britain, where she lived most of all—I mean, she's originally Australian. I think because of the transgender revolt of the last 10 years, she became very unfashionable with the people who came of age at that time. She was seen as being insufficiently inclusive of transgender women. But I think in Britain, the scales have tipped back toward—whatever you want to call it—sex realism, gender-critical feminism. People are now also rediscovering their love of Germaine Greer's brutal, radical honesty, I think we might call it. Personally, my favorite Germaine is not "Why I think naked boys are attractive" Germaine—that was a strange Germaine—nor even the Germaine of The Whole Woman or The Female Eunuch. But her writing on art criticism—she wrote a book about female painters called The Obstacle Race, which I read when I was revising this. As a scholar I think she's got another one called something like Kissing the Rod, which is about Restoration poetry. It's a very Germaine Greer title. She was an exceptional close reader of texts and paintings. And I wonder, actually, when the outrage about her comparing trans women to spaniels has all died down—we will remember the quality of her thoughts. In the same way that people now appreciate—you mentioned Valerie Solanas, but I'm thinking more of Andrea Dworkin. Penguin has just reissued all of Andrea Dworkin's work. Because it's now been long enough that people have kind of gotten over themselves about her controversies and remembered the interesting contributions that she made. But this comes exactly to what the whole book is about, which is: all of that depends on a generation of women—my age or below—who want to remember her, who want to keep enshrining her. This idea of history as a process—you know, we want to keep her memory and what she wrote alive. That's ultimately where the historical judgment comes from. It's whether or not the next generation thinks you're important. It seems to me that Britain has more—you know, and I use this term with air quotes—"TERFs" than American feminism. I think America maybe has a lot of… If you want to define it like this—80 percent of America thinks that sex matters and that there is a difference between trans women and women. Right? But those are none of— Yeah—none of that implies a different legal standing or anything like that. I have struggled. There's a tradition of French feminism, which is its own thing, and then Anglo-American feminism. I found it interesting, I guess, that there are very few American feminists who are on a Germaine Greer level—who exist and are talking publicly about this. Do you have a quick gloss on why it seems like second-wave feminism stuck around longer in England than it did in America? I think it's probably because of the trade union movement and the left feminist movement. Whereas in America, things became much more polarized. And also I think that in America, because abortion dominated the conversation for so long—and continues to dominate it—everybody gets sucked into that. There isn't a lot of space for other stuff. Plus, stuff like employment law being so much more federal in America—what are the kind of big…? And again, in America, race has been such a big part of the conversation for so much longer. I mean, Britain is now a much more diverse country than it was. But in the '90s, it was still 95 percent white. These are just much more recent questions about whether or not feminism is, quote, "white." In 1920, that wasn't a question in British feminism because everybody was white. Whereas it was a huge deal in America. So I think all of those social factors might account for it. I was just thinking as you were talking about England being blessedly white even into the 1990s. Whoa, whoa, whoa—I didn't say that! I was going to say—if you're looking for supplementary material for the eventual paperback edition of this, it would be great to look at Eric Clapton as a genius who then went on to a bit of racial… Very Shockley. A very Shockley trajectory. Like, "Oh, so you loved 'Layla'? Would you also like to hear my thoughts on race?" No—just play "Layla" again. That was really great. And he also has a few thoughts on COVID. I'm sure John Lennon would have had his few thoughts on COVID, I'm just saying. Well, yeah. This is where I think John Lydon—or Johnny Rotten—is kind of… he's a very stable genius, because whatever is dominant thinking, he will be on the other side of it at any given moment in time. But let's talk about Musk quickly. He's not the controlling metaphor of your book, but he is the controlling genius of our moment. Do you think his recent foray into politics—does that tarnish him? Because I was thinking: there's a science writer based in Canada named Dan Gardner. He has a fabulous Substack called Past, Present, Future, or something like that. He wrote a lot about Henry Ford. And he was like, "Hey, I want to tell you a story about a carmaker who really kind of blew his reputation by talking about stuff he didn't really know anything about." And it's about Henry Ford, who was a great genius at mass production and all of this kind of stuff. And then he got bored running a car company, and he's like, "OK, I'm going to solve World War I." And didn't he become a massive antisemite? Oh, he was. He is the Bob Dylan of antisemites. I don't know who's the ultimate Jew. He went electric. Yes, absolutely. And then he also ended up suing people who libeled him for describing him accurately, and then losing status in public court hearings. Because he's an idiot about all of this kind of stuff. Where does that story go? Because he is the epitome of galaxy brain. It's like: he's good at these things, so every thought he has is good, and we have to put up with him. You know, he was working for an administration where people want to have more kids and be Christian. We don't know how many children he has—virtually none of them in a marriage setting. He's divorced, and increasingly it's not even clear how many there are or under what circumstances they were born. That's one thing people tolerate—because he's good at making money and making cars. But then this political foray, where he's going back to Texas—is that the type of thing that destroys his geniusness, or does it remain to be seen? I mean, I think it does. How I've always felt about it is: SpaceX, which is the truly innovative business—if it manages to make reusable rockets work in that way that drives down the cost of space travel, that allows us to become an interplanetary species—I would have thought, in 400 years' time, we're not going to be talking about his bad tweets. But at the current rate, I think he deeply risks falling into that Shockley pattern—of somebody whose juice kind of runs out. Because look at the DOGE as we're talking, he's just been giving this round of kind of exit interviews complaining it was a lot harder than he thought it would be. And you know how he could have found out how hard it would have been? He could have asked me—an idiot—to tell him that. The fact is, governments are harder to run than private businesses, because you can't have creative destruction. You can't just let a government fail and someone else move in—people die, people don't get their Social Security checks. These are important things. But instead, he trampled through that undergrowth like a huge rhino, insistent that he knew best. And—shock horror—if he'd gone into that with his undoubted skills, but had learned more first, he would have been more successful at it. Well, from a Reason angle, it was frustrating, because there are people who work at Reason—but also there's a whole Gulag Archipelago of think tanks—of people who have said, "This is how you cut government spending and waste," etc. And, like, there are almost off-the-shelf plans you can bring in as opposed to going in and not succeeding. Ones that are increasingly picking up traction on the left, right? If you look at the whole abundance agenda—a lot of that is really saying, places like California don't work because they overregulate. What's that phrase of Ezra Klein's? "Everything bagel liberalism"—where it's like, "Why don't we make this housing project also solve racism and wild birds?" So there's definitely a libertarian critique that people feel government is slow and sclerotic. And a more humble man might have read those things first. The point with Musk is that—I guess this is part of where geniuses go to destroy themselves—they really don't think that, as your book argues—and I think it's completely persuasive—that breakthrough technologies are never the result of one person. But when you get exalted like that, then you stop looking around for the expertise or the team that will actually help you produce results. Then you're looking for yes men, or people who will… Your circle becomes—you become Kanye West or something, where nobody around you is going to say no. Yeah. And I think the really interesting examples of that—Picasso and Einstein are probably our most obvious examples. Most people's go-to ideas of artistic and scientific genius. But Einstein never really accepts quantum mechanics. So when he dies, he's more a celebrity than the kind of person in the field that young physicists look to. And Picasso similarly doesn't go to pure abstraction—he doesn't end up in the place of Rothko. That's because they had their paradigm shift. They had the moment where they were the perfect brain to meet the moment. And I think you probably see something very similar with Musk. He had a playbook—which, if you read Character Limit, the book about his takeover of Twitter—you know, he brings in his lieutenants, they lock everybody out of the systems, they fire everyone and rehire that they need. He just had this way that had worked for him in the past. And he went, "Bring on big balls, I'm going to do that to the government too." And he didn't realize that it was not the same environment, and that his one thing that had worked before would now not serve him anymore. And that, to me, exactly is what you're saying. It's a classic genius myth: you think, "I've got the answer," not realizing that different questions have different answers. Right. Yeah—and to go back to that idea of domain-specific intelligence or expertise: not everything is like everything else. That was one of the great myths in American capitalism in the mid-20th century that was destroyed—the idea that all businesses, regardless of what you produce, can be managed by a set of professional managers who are trained in management. And it turns out shipbuilding is very different from oil production, which is different from newspapers, and all of that. If I may—are there good examples of geniuses who run into the wall that Musk has driven his Tesla into with Dogecoin and everything—who then come back? Are there Paul McCartneys, whose second truth or last two-thirds of a career are actually as good or as interesting as the first third? That's a really good question. And I'll probably have to give it more thought than I'm able to on the hoof, because— I'll tell you what—I can't think of any examples offhand, but as you're saying that, I can totally see what a great story that is. And how much people would love that story. So there probably are examples of it. I'm thinking of the kid who was the actor in Indiana Jones who then didn't really do anything for ages and then won the Oscar for Everything Everywhere All at Once. People love that idea that this is the ultimate comeback story. So I can see that happening, where someone had been piddling away for a while and then came back with something. But I don't know. The best versions, I think, of people are your McCartneys or your Springsteens—or, you know, I went to see the Pixies last week. People who just carry on doing something because they clearly love it, the fans love it, and they enjoy it. And the Pixies gig was very interesting, because clearly people were there to hear the songs primarily from Surfer Rosa, their 1980s album. And they play those quite happily. Then they play some of their new stuff too. And I just thought: this is quite a good acknowledgment of: this was the moment we were hottest. We're not in that moment now. But we don't hate those people or resent that. We love that it happened. We're not sad that it didn't go on forever. That is fascinating. Yeah, I started my career as a teen magazine and rock music journalist. And there's nothing worse than bands or artists who hate the work that made them famous. It's an awful life. It's sad, isn't it? It's really sad. It is. And there are people—I'm thinking of someone like Nick Cave or Bob Dylan. They're very different, but Dylan refused to go away. He goes through cycles where stuff starts to make sense, even if it seems horrible the first time. And Cave has certainly been growing as an artist. And someone like Madonna—I think she stopped, in a way, but had a fantastic run. Can I just real quickly do a bit of biography? Because you mention at one point—and I thought this was fascinating in the book—that your father, in the '50s, took one of these inscrutable-to-Americans O-levels or A-levels, or whatever. I've read a ton of Beatles biographies, and they're always talking about how "I ruined my A-levels," and I have no idea what they're talking about. It's not easy to understand—like SATs. Yeah, no, of course—which is its own kind of bullshit. But your father did well on a test, and that meant that he got to go to university. What is your background, and how did you get to be where you're at? So the test you're talking about is the Eleven-Plus, which kids took at the age of 11. At the time—this is after… so my parents were both born in 1945—so this is in the aftermath of the Second World War. The idea was, if you came from a working-class family—and any other kind of family—that they were going to try and make higher-level education more accessible to a greater number of people. But the way to do that was by selecting viability. So you took this test at 11, and if you passed it, you went to a grammar school. If you didn't, you went to what was called a secondary modern or a technical school. The idea was that you either had an academic education or a vocational one based around going into trades. Because at 11—come on—the bread is baked, right? Well, that's a big… I mean, we mentioned Lewis Terman a long time ago. He also, earlier than that, thought that you could kind of pick future winners very early. And that's not always possible. The other thing it did was create—you know, you'll hear people today will say, "the Eleven-Plus was amazing because I got chances that I wouldn't otherwise got." But that's a kind of survivorship bias, because you don't hear as much from the people whose lives were ruined by being told at 11 they were not good enough. But in his case, it meant he was the first in his family to go to university. He went to Aston University in Birmingham to study chemistry. He worked first for Worcester Porcelain—where I grew up, which has its own delightful porcelain—and then for a place that made things you melt steel in—crucibles. Sorry, I know you're loving how much of an English stereotype I am, aren't you? Yeah. "It has a delightful bone china—from the Potteries." But you know, he benefited—definitely—he got lifted up like that. And on my mum's side, my granddad, who was Scottish, he was a coal miner. He moved south and took civil service exams as an adult. So he was the engine, he moved from working class to middle class, at that point. My mum then went to the same school I ended up going to, which was a convent school, a Catholic school. So I came from a really nice, normal middle-class high school. This was in the Midlands in England. I didn't know anybody who was a journalist. I didn't know anybody who lived in London. Even Birmingham was quite exciting to me. So I do have to remind myself every so often: if I could go back and talk to 16-year-old me about what I do and who I know, she would be pretty impressed. It is kind of fascinating, isn't it? There's a version of this in the U.S.—and I think throughout the West, and even much of the developing world—where tests, whether they're IQ tests or aptitude tests, they're used in many ways to reinforce the status quo or to naturalize it. But oftentimes, the goal—even when they were implemented—was not necessarily to do that, but to be more egalitarian and more meritocratic. Intelligence needs to be contextualized, and things like that. You know… Well, it's not necessarily a bad impulse, is it? Because actually, the signature event in my academic career was that I went to Oxford University, and that was determined— I said… A little place, yeah, in the Cotswolds. But that wasn't determined by a test for English—that was determined by an interview. And you know what? That obviously privileges eloquent bullshitters. The die was cast in my future in podcasting, because that's exactly what that selects for. Tests are bad in some ways, but they're also sort of… they're the worst thing apart from all the other things. We haven't yet invented a way of designing education that weeds out bias. The Eleven-Plus was notoriously problematic because it was easier for middle-class kids to pass it. They had more knowledge. Often just flat-out their parents hired tutors to get them through it. Now what happens is that there are very few grammar schools left, and the house prices around them are exceptionally high. So you end up with class sorting by who can afford to buy a house in that area. I mean, that's… to talk about the abundance agenda. And I always think when I hear about Ezra Klein, I'm like: If you want to read what Ezra Klein is going to write tomorrow, read what Reason was publishing 20 years ago. But part of it is—when it comes to educational opportunity and whatnot—the idea that, well, there are only 10 universities. So we have to sort to get the right people into that. It's like, maybe you create a world where there are many, many different universities—or more schooling opportunities—rather than funneling people through. In America, there was starting to retreat—not necessarily for good reasons—but there was this birth of gifted and talented programs. And most of the time, it wasn't just like, "If you hit this level of testing, you'll be in the gifted and talented program." It's like, "We only have a certain number of slots." And, well—if the test says you're gifted and talented, why don't you expand the program? But oftentimes, the function of schooling is not to increase opportunity, but to maintain the existing power structure. That's my idea. No, I know. And there's loads of stuff that happens like that. The Ivy Leagues, which excluded or limited Jewish students in the first half of the 20th century, they did that by saying, "We want to look at well-rounded students." Or they moved their recruitment pools out of New York City and into the outer boroughs—or whatever it might be. That's the only way I think T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound got into Ivy League schools—because they were from Missouri and Idaho. So they benefited from the geographical quota. But this is one of the big themes of the book: a level of humility about the systems we have and whether or not they are free from bias. And when the things that look natural and inevitable to us are actually the result of things we can't see—because, yeah, there are a lot of invisible hands. And actually, sometimes, extremely visible hands, if you care to look for them. Yeah, the Ivy Leagues now have a different way of keeping Jews off campus, right? So they—you know, it's more visible. This is not the first time that America's had debates about affirmative action. It just used to be that the affirmative action was in favor of WASPs in the 1920s. Yes, and I'm glad to live in a post-WASP America, for the most part. Just a final question about your method. Have you ever been called a genius? Hm. Why? One of the things that I find remarkable in your work—both the podcasting but then the writing work. I always take this as a sign of an excellent journalist—and I don't really care about "geniuses" is that you find a topic and then report out on it. And that way, you don't have to worry about a hot streak or a cold streak, because the onus isn't on you to be a genius all the time or to come up with new and novel things to say. You go out into the world and see what's happening. That seems to me that's a very rare model for journalism—but it obviously seems like the best way to do it. It's a great relief to just be like, "I am not actually that interesting. What I do is, I go and put myself in interesting places and meet interesting people—and I will tell you about them." And like you say, I'm surprised more people don't do it, because it's a huge burden off you. If you're not trying to be the main character in your drama—if you're content to be the amanuensis at the side—then yeah, it's a huge weight off your shoulders. And I think this is what drives a lot of modern journalists kind of mad: if you're only telling a story in which you're the protagonist, then you need to keep doing stuff. And actually, just go and talk to other people. Other people are mad. They say crazy things. That's Tom Wolfe, in the introduction to his collection The New Journalism, which was about stuff from the '60s and early '70s, published in the early '70s. He said that, "it was amazing. So many weird things were happening in America, and all you had to do was go out and hang out with people." He's seen as someone who's a genius—he has genius insights and is a stylist—but he says in plain sight:" just go and talk to people who are doing things you think are interesting." And you are interesting. It's also just the most fun. I mean, there's nothing that makes me happier than being in some random bit of backstreet America, just talking to people whose life experiences are completely different from mine. And I wish more people got the opportunity to do it, to be honest. The color that you add to, you know, talking about going to—or witnessing—one of the SpaceX launches or recoveries is brilliant. You know, because it's out in the world. It's wonderful. I have kept you overlong—I apologize for that. Where are the best places people should look for your work? You can find most of it through my Substack, which is helenlewis.substack.com. And also my longer, more considered work is at The Atlantic, who are very kind in giving me—the thing that I really like about working for them is that they invest in you as a person. And like you say, reporting is the best and most fun thing to do. And it's not the easiest thing to do in journalism at the moment. So I give them huge credit for letting me—letting me be my best self. God, that sounded like therapy. Sorry—what a hateful note to end on. I'm going to go and have, like, a muffin and a crumpet and be overly British. Yeah, maybe talk about Princess Diana and how sad it is. Are you up on the royals? Do you like the royals? Oh, yeah. I know. There was a time during the Prince Harry saga where I was threatening to become The Atlantic's royal correspondent, just because I enjoy writing about them. And by God, do Americans love reading about them. I don't understand that. And I think Harry was best when he was following in—was it Edward VII or VIII?—when he was doing the Nazi costumes. I was going to say, "being a Nazi." It's all been downhill for him since then. Helen Lewis, thank you so much. It was a real delight talking to you. The Genius Myth is a spectacular book. It's the best thing you've written recently—until the next one. So thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Elon Musk Nick Gillespie | 6.4.2025 11:00 AM HD Video Download Today's guest is Helen Lewis, a British journalist and podcaster who is a staff writer for The Atlantic. Her new book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, and it explores how the definition of what it means to be a genius has changed radically over the centuries, how it became linked to all sorts of weird biological theories, and how Elon Musk has come to personify genius in our time (and whether his failure at the Department of Government Efficiency spells the end of his genius moment). Lewis and Reason's Nick Gillespie also talk about The Beatles; William Shockley, who turned to racial science after winning a Nobel Prize for helping to invent the transistor; and her notorious 2018 interview with Jordan Peterson for British GQ, which has racked up over 70 million views. 0:00— Introduction 1:36— The Genius Myth 7:20— How dead geniuses fueled national myths 11:30— Thomas Carlyle and the Great Man theory 18:18— Are inventions inevitable? 23:22— Francis Galton and eugenics 33:35— Pro-natalism and declining fertility rates 37:14— William Shockley 48:00— Shakespeare and The Beatles 57:22— Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and the gender dimensions of genius 1:03:50— Lewis' Jordan Peterson interview 1:07:18— Germaine Greer and second wave feminism 1:11:05— The gender debate in the UK vs US 1:14:14— Elon Musk's rise and fall? 1:20:57— Do geniuses have second acts?

Helen Lewis: Thank you for having me. Let's start with the obvious question. The book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, which is a great subtitle. But why did you write The Genius Myth? Do you know what, it's one of those things where it's evolved over time, so I may be now lying to myself about why I wrote it. But I did have a conversation with a friend a couple of years ago about the idea that—he has always said that genius is a right-wing concept, which I thought was a really interesting idea because it's about the individual over the collective. It's about people with sublime achievement who are not part of the common throng. And I thought that was interesting. I thought, well, I hear loads and loads of left-wing people use it very casually, and I don't think they're accepting this kind of idea behind it. And then that made me think, well, hang on a minute, what other ideas are kind of being smuggled in in that little word? And that's where the book kind of came from. That's fascinating. And it puts me in mind—the book is fantastic. I mean, it is a great read. It's better than 99 percent of novels I read. And I love—it's a series of stories about kind of crazy people and the people, including all of us, who enable them. But part of what you talk about in The Genius Myth is that being a genius meant radically different things in different eras. Explain in ancient Greece—and I don't know why we care about what ancient Greece thought about anything—but the Greeks talked about having genius, or being a genius meant that you were possessed with a visiting spirit. Can you explain what that means? Yeah, you have a genius—that's the original sense of it. You're visited by this spirit, and you know, it might be the muse of poetry speaks through you, or the muse of history. And they called it furor poeticus, furor divinus—divine fury. And I think that captures something really well. I don't know if you would describe yourself as a genius, Nick, but most of us wouldn't. But you must have had moments when you've sat down— No, very few people have defined me as a genius, so thank you. But you might have had times when you sit down to write a piece or do some piece of work, and it just clicks. Something just feels really good. And I think most writers probably spend most of their life kind of chasing that dragon for the rest of the time. You go, 'when will it come back?' And that's what writing should feel like, and most of the time it's just a kind of grind. So I think they did a very good thing then in capturing something that we've all felt to some extent. There are moments that work. You talk about how, particularly in the context of things like pop music and whatnot—and this is certainly true for writers and novelists in particular—you go on a streak where you are just performing at a higher level. I want to get into an argument about the Beatles for any number of reasons. It's independent of you—I have this argument every morning. But when you look at somebody like Paul McCartney, who you talk about in an interesting way, he's got to understand that whatever he's been doing for the past 40 years is not what he did for that 5- to 10-year period. He was on. So you go from that classical understanding of genius as a visiting spirit or something is speaking through you—which now is almost always the province of serial killers, right? I guess I had the dog talk to me, and it told me to kill me. They're the last classical geniuses in this tattered world. But then in the Renaissance things shift—the Renaissance and the early modern period. How does being a genius change in that period? Maybe even a little bit later than that, because the thing about the Renaissance is always that the word comes from rinascita—rebirth. So the idea was that they were, as they saw it, bringing back the classical tradition. And it was kind of quite imitative—you were trying to learn these things about proportion and form. Well, I don't want to get sidetracked. I'm just going to say yes—they were smuggling what they wanted to do by saying, "What we're really doing is merely bringing back these eras of former greatness." There's the American Renaissance in American literature, which was created in the 1940s about the pre–Civil War period. And I believe there's a racial journal now called American Renaissance, which—they want to rebirth things. So in this early modern period redefinition of genius, what's going on? Then you get this very, very important book that I had to say I didn't really know about, which is Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists. And it is a group biography of—I have to say, all the artists that I would have known growing up because they were also Ninja Turtles, like Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo. But there is a sense that that was a period of a kind of burst of creativity, and he puts them together in this kind of pantheon. And it's one of the first times that you begin to see, in a really systematic way—this is what I mean by the genius myth. These are stories that we tell about people who are innovators or scientists or artists. So you have, for example, the story of Leonardo da Vinci. And the myth that's imposed on him is that he couldn't settle on anything. He had a kind of—an uber level of ADHD. He was designing the helicopter, then he wanted to learn how to paint directly onto a wall using tempura, then he was doing something else. He was kind of a scatterbrain. We have all met that person in our first semester in college as well—who's just so brilliant. Obviously Leonardo accomplished a few things, as well. It's true—not all of the people that you meet in the first semester at college go on to paint the Mona Lisa, or anything like it, sadly. But what I was getting at is that the Mona Lisa wasn't really the Mona Lisa until centuries after it. Until it got stolen. This is one of my favorite things in all of it. It's the same way that Shakespeare died a respectable playwright, but he didn't die the guy that we should enthrone forever as the crowning jewel of English literature. That really a century later. And exactly the same thing with the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa was—and I'm going to be really rude here and say—quite a sludgy gray and green painting, and not seen as the crowning achievement of the Renaissance by any means. It gets stolen in the 1920s and ends up in Italy. And it becomes—actually, as lots of these things do—about national myths, because Leonardo was Italian or proto-Italian, but he was working for most of his life in France. So it becomes a kind of 'Who owns this great genius?' and 'Therefore, who should have the Mona Lisa?' And then it becomes a kind of inter-country fight. It's also great because, in the United States in particular, Italians have always claimed Christopher Columbus. But now many of us Italian Americans are like, "Oh, maybe he was working for Spain, and maybe he is a Jew, so forget it. We don't need Columbus anymore." He's not The Sopranos… But da Vinci is one model of a Renaissance genius. Talk about Michelangelo or some of the others. The person categorizing them said, "OK, well, there are different gradations." He seemed very much like a boy with a bunch of Pokémon dolls or something where he's rank ordering them things like that. Yeah, well, he definitely had a bias. He had a pro-Florentine bias. So he's quite rude about Titian, who was born—I think— Venice or the Alps. But he kind of gets relegated to second status because he's not from the right place. But Michelangelo, he uses as a different example, which is something you find all the time in genius myths: which is someone who had to struggle. So that's turned into a story about how hard it was to paint the Sistine Chapel, and how he had to design all the stuff you'll hear if you go on the tour of the Sistine Chapel. The other thing that you will know from visiting the Sistine Chapel is that it's a lot. It's quite—it is a statement, is it not? Yeah. And I think that's kind of fascinating too—that you have to have a level of ambition. The film critic called it white elephant art. Which he didn't intend as a compliment—these films that kind of announce themselves as a masterpiece. And I think that actually is also quite pertinent to this. The fact that Ulysses by James Joyce is very hard to read—not an enjoyable novel in the conventional sense—is actually taken as being a sign of its genius. The fact that the Sistine Chapel is big…if he'd done that much individual painting and separated it out by canvases, we wouldn't find it quite so impressive as this one—you know, what's that German word? Kunstkammerwerk—you know, the kind of the whole thing is it. You have that word written on your computer, and you use it in every conversation that you ever have. That's true. I do, actually. Yeah, you've rumbled me. But you know what I mean—like that idea of the kind of… You still see it now when you have like, oh, Birdman, it's filmed like it was in a single shot, or The Revenant, oh it only filmed in natural light, or Tom Hanks really lost all the weight for Cast Away, or Charlize Theron made herself ugly for Monster. These are kind of—there's a price to greatness. I like the movies where people gain weight, because anybody can lose weight, right? If we may jump forward a little bit—and I want to skip over him a little bit, both because he deserves to be forgotten, but I want to get to a later figure in Victorian England—but Thomas Carlyle pops up a couple of times in your work. And he is kind of the modern conceptualizer, right, of Great Man Theory, which is related to genius but it's not quite the same thing. Life writing takes form, and then you get the Industrial Revolution and capitalism. And what you then get is genius really as a marketing tool. So, if you're an artist in the 14th century, what you need is a rich aristocratic patron. If you're an artist in the 18th century, 19th century—well, actually, at this point there'd be things like, you know, gallerists start arriving, things like newspapers arrive, mass media arrives, and you might therefore be able to brand, basically. But what's interesting is that most of the time, or at least at that point, it seems to be less the person selling themselves as a genius, and they have a Boswell—or they have somebody around them who is writing them up as, like, "Oh, this is the real guy," like a hype man. A Flavor Flav. Yeah, everybody needs an 18th century Flavor Flav. Yes, it's true. But then you have somebody like Thomas Carlyle, who, you know, very much of a… in the context of his time, it's not like he was a right-winger. And he hated capitalism, certainly. And he hated all of the liberal economists who actually thought that Irish people and Blacks in Jamaica were human in the same way he was. But how does he talk about Great Man Theory, and how does that kind of add to the genius lore before it gets kind of quantified and mathematized later in that century? Yeah, he has this line, which I'm going to mangle, but it's something like, "The history of the world is, at root, only the history of great men." And that was very in keeping with a certain type of patrician Victorian thinking—that you just needed these once-in-a-generation personalities. One of their references would have been someone like Napoleon Bonaparte, the great French general. And I think there's a lot to that argument—that actually, the military decisions that Napoleon made at the times that he made them changed the history of Europe. He was a consequential figure. In the same way that now The Atlantic just ran a cover story on Donald Trump that said he's the most consequential president of the 21st century. I do think it's a reasonable point to say that some people are kind of hinge points in history. I was gonna make a joke about like, what's his competition so far though? You know, it's—zombie Abe or whatever. And you thought—"No, I love Obama and I would never say anything mean about him." Well, I know. I said, unfortunately, from my stupid libertarian point of view, I see an immense continuity between George W. Bush, Obama, Trump I, [Joe] Biden, Trump II. And it's not a good continuity. But, you know, this is part of what you're talking about when you talk about The Genius Myth—you're not saying everybody is exactly the same, and it's just a social construction that Leonardo gets called a great artist, but actually anybody around him was as good. But it is this storytelling and kind of creating this sense that these people are the limit of everything that we're doing. But with Carlyle—so Carlyle—I guess in a way systematic thinking— this is what the Enlightenment was about. And to some degree, the Renaissance—it hadn't quite got there. And you certainly get there with somebody like [Karl] Marx and [Freidrich] Engels, where they kind of say, actually it's the system. It's the base—typically the economic base—that actually determines everything else. So we might forgive Carlyle this one thing of not really understanding. Oh, I totally forgive him because, you know, what's the easiest thing to do is to go, "Actually, it's both," because it obviously is both, right? Some people do make decisions, but also they are products of fundamental forces that are in society. And I guess—now let me, because I outed myself on my libertarian podcast show as a libertarian—maybe it's people like Adam Smith who started to talk about how things don't just happen. There are a lot of kind of occult forces, invisible hands and whatnot, that create order among seeming chaos. And you could extend that to individuals. I feel like this is a big part of your life's work—the meta story that you tell now—which is just that it's a mix of both. It's circumstance and it's individual effort. And that should in no way ever be controversial, but it seems like it constantly needs to be relearned. Absolutely. Because you bring up Carlyle, and he was writing defensively. That's what I didn't really realize until I looked more at that stuff. I sort of assumed everybody in the Victorian era was swanning around going, "Of course the thing is that just a couple of men changed the world." But no—he was writing to defend that idea against what he saw as the kind of forces of egalitarianism. There's a fantastic book called How the Dismal Science Got Its Name by David Levy, which is a study mostly of how Carlyle and other people like him treated the Irish in popular culture and academic discourse basically in the long 19th century. And they were mad that people were saying, "No, actually the Irish are pretty much like the rest of us. They follow incentives. They're not all gorillas or chimpanzees." And that's why Carlyle named the dismal science "the dismal science," because he said that was its main truth—that all humans respond similarly to incentives. What a dismal science that we're not somehow more elevated than the lower order. That's great—to accidentally coin a really great phrase like that when you're trying to be rude. Yes, right. But the point I try to make in the book is that we always end up coming back to Great Man Theory—even people on the left—because we want stories. And stories demand protagonists. Frankly, your biography of Napoleon is going to sell a lot better than your book about agrarian upheaval in France in the 18th and 19th centuries. It's just more interesting to have… You know, when you write a screenplay, the first thing anyone will ever tell you is you have to have a protagonist and they have to be active—they have to make decisions. That's how our minds want history to kind of work. But there's a brilliant paper that I reference in the book from 1922, about "Are Inventions Inevitable?" And the list that they have of the number of things that got invented simultaneously—the most obvious one is the telephone, right? Two people came up with the telephone, and only one of them gets the credit. I write about Edison—Thomas Edison—later in the book. And everybody had the idea for the light bulb. Every man and his dog had that idea because it's quite a simple conceptual idea. What they couldn't do for 100 years was manufacture it and reliably make it work. And the real genius of Edison, if he had it, was, I think, the New York City power grid. But again, that's just not as compelling a story as "Man invents light bulb" that you can see and hold in your hand. And Edison, then—and you point out that he ended up in a fight that he lost. I mean, he lost a lot of his invention battles overall. He was a proponent of direct current, and alternating current won out and ultimately kind of swallowed a lot of his activity. And with Edison, I mean, there's always the fascinating concept of Edison versus Tesla. So you have Edison as one kind of genius, and then Tesla as another—crazy, more romantic genius, because he ended in failure. Do you know, my favorite anecdote is the fact that Tesla walked out of Edison's lab—where he worked for a while—because they had a bet, which Tesla won, and then Edison got really grumpy about him. And I just think this is fascinating because—I don't know if you know this—a couple of months ago, the podcaster Sam Harris told the story. He had a bet about deaths during the coronavirus pandemic with Elon Musk, and Sam Harris won. And then he said, "So, where's my—pay up, son?" And then Elon Musk kind of just got weird—kind of grumpy—and ended their friendship. I like that. That is a great way for Sam Harris to call himself a genius. —is to call himself Tesla. But it is also interesting that, in the book, I had already made this comparison between Edison and Elon Musk—both in the sense of the style of invention they do, their talent for publicity, but also the ego, frankly, that has made them want to play the public role of an inventor. And I think that's where the bet story really comes from. Neither of them likes to be beaten or humiliated. They were both schemers—not ivory tower scientists happy to do their own thing and let the chips fall where they may. They both want to be out there in the world selling themselves. And so that echo was very pleasing. Yeah. And we'll talk more about Musk at the end, I think—or toward the end of this conversation. But Edison also was—he really did work long hours, but he also did what Benjamin Franklin called "visible industry." Like, he made sure you knew. How did you know Edison worked 24 hours a day? Because he told you every time he saw you, or he had people in the press who were either sycophants or on his payroll or whatever, who were telling people. It's not clear that he ever said that creativity or genius is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration, but that captured the image that he was pushing. Oh yeah. I mean, I've got actually—I think more respect for Edison as a businessman and as a marketer than I had when I came in. But you're right, because everyone wanted the myth to be that they were kind of—you know, the easiest mark is somebody who wants to believe what you're selling them. And everybody wanted to believe that he was this American Prometheus. You know, he was stealing fire from the gods. And this is what I mean—to come back to nationalism again. This was a time in which America was the future. Europe was kind of classy, but it was old and hidebound and dying. And America was the new continent of steel and electricity and the railroad and these big barons. And Edison fit that image that America had of itself at that time. So he slotted himself in very neatly. There was a pre-made genius myth for him as an American genius. Right. And if I'm remembering, there was a fantastic series of kids books called Childhood of Famous Americans. All right. And it was the same story told over and over again, but they would change the names and places. And there was one of Edison, and part of his myth is that at some point he was working as a baggage boy on a railroad or something, and he was missing his train, and he gets pulled in by his ears—which caused hearing loss. So he became a great telegraph operator, and his kids were nicknamed Dot and Dash. But a lot of it came from: he was a small kid from nowhere who had bad hearing because of this industrial accident, and then he becomes the greatest inventor of all time. And he gets rewritten as well as "Tom" Edison—young Tom Edison, like Tom Sawyer—rather than his actual first name, which was Alva. And that again just speaks to the kind of— The country hasn't been invented yet that's going to promote an "Alva" as their great inventor. Yeah. And there's a famous movie called Young Tom Edison with, like, Jimmy Stewart or somebody playing him. So this gets done again and again. But now let's bring it back to the evil effects of the British on public discourse, and let's talk about Francis Galton. Because what is interesting—you have the geniuses themselves who become public either because somebody writes about them or they're creating their own myth. But then you have somebody like Francis Galton, who helped kind of quantify—or tried to quantify—what genius meant, and also why it's hereditary and why it persists in certain types of people but not others. Explain who Francis Galton is. He was a really brilliant dilettante—from the time when you could just skip around and come up with lots of different things. He tried to create a beauty map of the British Isles and work out where the women were hottest. I mean, very much actually the precursor of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook in that respect. But was he a lifelong bachelor? He definitely was childless, right? He married, yes, but I can't detect any real enthusiasm for women—or, indeed, any other people at all. Did he marry—did he fight? Like, he was like, "The Orkney Islands have the hottest babes, so I'm going there," or something? No, I think it was—I think it was an arranged marriage. There's a bit in his memoir of his essentially like gap year, where he goes to Africa. One of the chieftains offers him a woman as a "temporary wife," and he declines because she's covered in— that orange pigment, and he doesn't want to get it on his white linen suit. And it's just the sort of most Englishman-abroad kind of colonial power. That's pretty amazing.You have a lot to be ashamed of. OK, thank you. I'll take that one actually. He was also the half-cousin of Charles Darwin. He came from this very storied family in the 19th century, and he therefore was familiar with the idea of evolution by natural selection. You know, this was the idea that survival of the fittest—that people passed down something that now we think of in terms of genes. They didn't have that kind of biological basis to it initially. But he was very interested to think, well, hang on a minute—you can breed dogs in all these different ways. You can breed cattle. Maybe we could breed humans. And this is what I mean about him not showing really any kind of… It just doesn't make sense… Right. Him not showing any kind of fellow feeling for other humans. It was like, "Where could this possibly go wrong? I'm sure this won't have any bad consequences whatsoever." And of course, it did, right? Because he coined the term eugenics, which is from "good birth," essentially, and then dysgenics—which you hear a bit about today. He wrote this book called Hereditary Genius, in which he tried to work out how frequently genius and high achievement occurred in the population and how it was passed down. And people were kind of slagging it off from the very beginning. There's a great dunk of it from a Victorian writer at the time—because he works out that there's a whole family of judges, and he essentially posits the existence of a kind of hereditary judginess. And someone else calls them a "snug little galaxy of jobbers," which I think is right. Just the idea that actually, if you're a judge and your nephew wants to be a judge, then there may be other ways by which that happens rather than pure genetic inheritance. But that's a very influential book among a whole generation of statisticians, because he was a brilliant statistician. And they were also heavily influenced by eugenics. Can I ask was he actually a brilliant statistician, or was he just really novel in what he applied statistics to? Like, he measured a lot of stuff and then said, "OK, well, it means this," but. I mean, the question is— —have concepts like standard deviation, correlation, things like that—they come from his thinking and his work. So he's there right at the birth of this discipline as an academic one. So I think you can say that he was brilliant. And to go back to the idea of, like, do individuals create inventions or do larger forces produce them—is he, as England is moving out—or as the modern world, certainly Europe, is moving out—of kind of inherited aristocracy, he provides a rationale for why the ruling class deserves to be. And this is more of a Marxist kind of interpretation, but it's that Victorian England had to produce Francis Galton, because otherwise people would be like, "Why am I listening to these people simply because they, when I was born, had more money than me?" Yeah, I think that's very true. And also, he provides an excellent justification for imperialism, which was also a great enthusiasm of England at the end of the 19th— He didn't create it. But then provides a justification for what's happening anyway. Which, yeah, in a lot of social theory—that probably, well, now that I'm thinking about it, might be a better interpretation of a lot of social theory—that it's not leading where society goes, but it's rather kind of explaining why we're doing what we're already doing. Yeah, I think you can say there was a kind of Francis Galton–shaped hole in the discourse, and he popped into it quite neatly to say, "Europeans are of better racial stock than Africans," right? And that was obviously something that white Europeans were very keen to hear at the end of the 19th century. Well, some of them, right? Because it really took a couple more generations to figure out, "OK, well, which…who are the Europeans who are actually European, as opposed to Africa due north?" I mean, by the end of the 19th century, you had people who were like, "Well, the Nordics and the Alpines are OK, but these Mediterraneans, like, nah—they're not really…" Well, that's where we have to flick it over to the Americans really taking up the mantle on that. Because they just went, "Hang on a minute. Polish people aren't quite European. Italian people aren't quite European. Irish people aren't quite European. We mean the Nordics, right?" And that's how our racial laws are going to say that the true descendants of the ancient Greeks, bizarrely. I don't know why the ancient Greeks got away scot-free, despite being from Southern Europe, as being very intelligent. If they were so good, they wouldn't have gone away. I mean, this is what I just—I don't understand. But yeah, you're right. He just becomes a very influential figure in what then develops into eugenics and race science. His name has recently been taken off a lot of buildings at University College London. And it's one of those ones where I think I'm ok with it. You know, I think there are lots of cases for whether—- went too far… Am I remembering correctly—part of his research method was measuring the column inches or the number of mentions in encyclopedias of famous people to kind of— He did obituaries, yeah. And then Havelock Ellis, who was a sexologist, does another book in which he basically gets out a ruler. And this is the problem that always happens with these people—they get completely stuffed by Shakespeare, about whom we know very little, and Jane Austen, who lived a very quiet, boring, blameless life in a parsonage. So the biographical idea that you just—you have a lot of biographical detail and you get written about a lot—completely falters. And then they just end up fudging these supposedly scientific lists. Which is the methodology that Charles Murray used in his book Human Accomplishment, where he looked at reference works and measured column inches. Which I think probably calls more for a Freudian interpretation rather than a mathematical interpretation of what's going on. Right. I think you can say it's all interesting data, but it's not objective scientific data. Because you can measure how someone's reputation has changed over time, but you can't say there's a kind of version of just desserts where the most intelligent people get the most column inches. I think our own media at the moment would heavily debunk that idea. Talk about eugenics briefly, because we're also—and this is in the Muskosphere and Peter Thielosphere and stuff like that—where people are talking about eugenics. It's one thing if you're saying the state is running things and saying, "You can mate with these people but not those people," and things like that. You know, when you are going to Burning Man or you're at the Bohemian Grove and it's a voluntary association, we all are eugenicists. We all practice some form of "good birth," where we choose these people rather than those people. Is there a way to disentangle eugenics from its kind of history? Is there a eugenics which does not immediately—or quickly—devolve into racial sorting and some kind of horrific cataclysm of human suffering? In practice, I think, no. I think in theory, you're right—it doesn't have to go in those directions. And I think actually—again, I think you're kind of alluding to this—most people, when you drill down to it, are softly eugenicists themselves. Most people: A, they choose their partner because they think their partner is attractive and smart and would be a good father or mother—which is itself kind of eugenics. The second thing is that most people are broadly supportive of women having abortions of babies with severe and life-limiting illnesses—even those like Down syndrome that aren't necessarily fatal. So, lots of people think that looking after a disabled kid would be really hard, and people should have the choice to opt out of that. I have this argument with one of my friends, who has written brilliant books about eugenics. And I said, "But that is eugenic." And you just don't want to call it eugenics because, to you, eugenicism is bad. But you support this. And I think that's what I mean about in practice, I think there are things that people do agree with that you could describe as eugenic. But in any kind of organized movement, it is so unbelievably tainted by what happened in California in the '30s—huge amounts of sterilizations of the quote-unquote "feeble-minded"— by what had happened under the Nazis, that no reputable scientist would touch it with a 10-foot bargepole. And I don't really see the need to rehabilitate it in these individual cases. Do you see any—I realize it's a little bit off topic—but we are now, because there is a demographic collapse happening. It's women's fault. Women are having fewer children now that they have more job opportunities. Right, because they're grasshoppers, and they reproduce by themselves. Yeah, it's women's fault, yeah. But throughout the West—certainly in the U.S., but then especially in those old parts of Europe that maybe really aren't European, places like Hungary—there's a big push for natalism. The state needs to pump up the volume of kids being born. And countries like Singapore spend millions—or billions—of dollars a year trying to do that. Is that a form of eugenics as well? Should we be concerned, from a history-of-eugenics point of view, about what happens when the state starts to say, "You need to be having more kids"? I think the main contradiction to that is that we don't have any evidence that it works. Stalin had a medal that was like—if you had 10 kids, you got a medal. Yeah, I think it was six or something, but yeah. I mean, to me, what I consider to be a lot of children. And there have been regimes through history that have tried to—currently, Viktor Orbán in Hungary said very explicitly, "I don't want more immigrants. I want more Hungarians." And he has put in tax breaks for people who have more than three children, reductions on the people carrier, you know. But with negligible effects, from what I can see. Unless you're running a really brutally directive society like China, where you can dictate to people how many kids they have— And that it was more about having fewer. But now it's like, "Please, please, can you—people—start having children again? We've realized this is a demographic problem." And I think that will be harder to reverse than the previous one-child policy. That's the thing that's interesting. And I think actually—oh, I've forgotten her name, the brilliant researcher Alice—and I've just talked to Ross Douthat about this at The New York Times—that actually it's not even just the West. Quite conservative societies in North Africa are also seeing this reduction in birth rates. No, it tracks perfectly with the proxy that I've seen brooded about a lot is the number of years of education women have on average. As that increases, fertility rates decline—always and everywhere. And it's that the world has become more modern, meaning that women have more opportunity and more equality and more education. I know Mexican women in Mexico have more kids than they do in America. They cross the border, and they have fewer kids. And that's not even that big a difference. But everywhere, yeah—it's a global phenomenon. And I think it contributes as a sign of progress, actually. Because it means more people, I think, are making more choices. I think it's a sign of progress. I think it's very hard to square with our current gerontocracies in terms of our political systems. I mean, that's the problem. In Britain having fewer working-age people to support more older people is a problem, when those older people are on unsustainably high pensions and earlier retirement… You know, I have a political ideology of limited government and a basic social safety welfare net that I would love to sell to you right now. The problem isn't that people are getting older; it's that we have unsustainable entitlement programs that we can thank Bismarck for. Oh, right. OK. Yeah, OK—so we've put, so far, the villains of today's podcast as the English and Otto von Bismarck. OK, good to have the enemies list updated. Come on, surely let's argue about the Beatles now, Nick. You've been holding out on me. Yeah, well, before we get to them, I want to talk about William Shockley, who is somebody that I think a fair number of my audience will remember. He encapsulates something perfect—partly because he is related, he's a kind of semi-direct descendant intellectually of Galton. But he is also fantastic because he brings us closer to Silicon Valley. William Shockley won a Nobel Prize for his role—contested as it may be—in developing the transistor. And then he became a—you know, he took that— He was a massive prick. And everybody left his firm, and they went on to found Silicon Valley. That's the short way. That's right. On the business end, he had this great creation, or he was part of a great invention, and then he was such a terrible manager that everybody who worked for him—who were incredibly talented—were like, "Fuck it, we're going to start our own company." And that became modern Silicon Valley. And then he spent the rest of his life, "electronics, who cares, I want to talk about racial differences that are quantifiable." And he is the genius, in a way, who precedes many other figures that we'll talk about, but where he was great at one thing, and then spent most of his time talking about stuff—that is just crazy pants—and it takes away from his luster as a great inventor. Yeah, I was just rereading the interview that he did with Playboy. It was one of those kind of great heyday-of-Playboy, nine-billion-page interviews. And it's just—it's really sad to see somebody who obviously had a great scientific brain, but they've just picked up a load of goo, basically. Like, for example, he didn't—you know, the interviewer talks to him about his decision to donate to the so-called Genius Sperm Bank, which is a kind of cursed idea from the start. But he has no idea that men's sperm degrades with age and that at 70, the old swimmers might not be in the best condition. And he just completely hasn't looked into that. And it's a kind of sad version of someone who obviously had a great and flexible intellect in their youth, and they've just kind of hardened. And I don't know about you, but when I was reading that, it felt like one of those kind of internet–social media–era midlife crises ahead of its time. I'm sure the obvious example is Naomi Klein's book about Naomi Wolf, a great feminist scholar, gets caught out and then drifts into the kind of QAnon sphere Wolf found out on—was it the BBC? Live on radio. She basically had a book that was about gay men. And she said that there were a number of them who were executed for sodomy. And it turned out that the phrase that had been written was "death recorded." And that didn't mean they'd been executed. That meant that they'd had a death sentence and actually most of them had ended up commuted or whatever. But it was just this very embarrassing thing that dented her credibility in the liberal sphere. So she went over to the other side. And here is—I'm going to make—this is an act of genius that I almost certainly won't pull off, because I'm not a genius. But that moment where she is live talking to the interviewer who points that out to her, and she's like, "Oh… oh." I mean, you just see something change. It's almost like having a stroke. It's very similar to the moment—and I believe you mention this in the book—the Peter Jackson documentary about the Beatles, Get Back, when the song "Get Back" comes into recognizable form. Where the Fab Four are noodling around, and then suddenly you hear this classic song come into being. Yeah, it's a live-action shot of somebody who basically—and I think this is exactly what happened to Shockley. Shockley won his Nobel Prize, the career stalled, he couldn't understand what happened to it. He made, I think, one idle comment about IQ and everyone screamed at him. And he did exactly what happens to lots of people now in that situation, where he felt like that was unfair and unjust, and so he kind of did it harder. And he became a provocateur, and he got into this mindset of, "The more that I'm owning the libs, the righter I must be." And I think you just—you see that. I still think you see that now, and I understand it psychologically. Yeah, like you say, "I'm this thing that you know is horrible, and it's like I'm going to be your worst nightmare version." And in the point about Shockley—and this is, I mean, a credit to the book and to your work—is that Shockley was not— here was an ongoing study of IQ and super-smart kids in California that he did not make the cut for. So you have a guy who becomes obsessed with IQ as this thing that is free-floating and independent from all sorts of influences. And you have to—I mean, anybody reading that in the contemporary world would say, "Oh, he became obsessed with IQ because he was a genius, but he was not ratified as a genius in this grammar school or high school study going on in California." I found that very telling. Yeah, that's Lewis Terman's Genetic Studies of the Gifted, and the cutoff point was either 140 or 135 on this particular IQ score. And he claims that his mother got an IQ score of 150, but he was below it. And actually, there was one other Nobel Prize winner, Luis Alvarez, who also didn't make the cut. And the really sad thing is, in that Playboy interview, he says, "Well, you know, I think probably my IQ has gone up a bit since then," which isn't really how it works between being a school kid and being 70, right? But obviously—you can—yeah, I think you're exactly right. When I read that, I thought, oh, there's the chip on the shoulder. That actually, he's had all the success—what more success could you want than having a Nobel Prize if you're in the sciences? But somehow, there's some little bit of him that still feels he's not enough. And actually, if he clings to this idea of superiority through IQ—racial superiority through IQ—that rubs a little bit of salve on that chip. What goes into people who—and I want to get to the Beatles, because I can talk about The Beatles endlessly. And I met Paul McCartney once— Oh, wow! Yeah, as a college kid. So it was quite exciting, and it led to one of the reasons that I no longer like The Beatles so much. Oh, ok? So that's a good tease, right? But to focus on Shockley a little bit—what goes on where you are a genius in this field or this set of fields—manufacturing, science, invention, electricity—and then you say, "Well, fuck it. What I really want to talk about is race and IQ"? You mentioned, like, his career seemed to stall because nobody—literally nobody—wanted to work with him. They were like, "I'm leaving. You cannot lock me in this factory anymore. I'm just going." But how does that happen? Because this is part of what the book is about. We're in a golden age now where if you are really good at making money on Wall Street, or if you are really good at inventing an electric car, if you are really good at making pop music, we really want to hear your thoughts about all of these other fields that you know absolutely nothing fucking about. I know. It's strange, isn't it? I think, yeah, that does seem to me the Shockley story. There is a heavy suggestion that he kind of piggybacked on the precise version of the transistor that won the Nobel Prize—it was really other people's work—and that people in the lab got tired of him being a kind of credit hog. And then he started getting into applying psychometric testing to his employees, which is always a red flag, I would say. If I may—I've never had to take a psychometric job test, or one that presented itself as such, but my father worked for a shipping company and he used to tell this story that I found very funny. It was called Sea-Land, and it kind of popularized containerized shipping in the postwar era. But it was founded by a guy named Malcolm McLean, who was an illiterate son of sharecroppers in North Carolina. And then, at a certain point, when the company got big enough, they were like, "OK, you've got to start taking business seriously." And they had all of the employees take kind of basic IQ tests to see if they were Sea-Land–worthy people. And Malcolm McLean failed it—because he was basically illiterate, and he was not functioning at the higher level. But, you know—so you had this moment in the heyday of scientific management, where a guy who revolutionized shipping would not be hired at his own company because he was kind of retarded. Wow, that's wild. Yeah, so I always— It doesn't surprise me, because I think that, you know, you would always want to have a higher IQ than not. But I think people overrate that—when you're getting way above the average—how important it is versus personality traits like conscientiousness, openness to experience, whatever it might be. So I think I'm entirely unsurprised by that, but your question kind of speaks to one of the things I talk about in the book, which is this idea of galaxy brainlessness. Which is the idea that, "I'm a smart person, all my opinions are smart." And I think it's just demonstrably not true. And the other thing is—I think it's really sad for the geniuses themselves. Because you look at someone like Shockley, and he has his success because his type of intelligence and his breakthroughs interact with a particularly fertile moment in the history of Silicon Valley, right? He had the right brain for the right time. And what often happens to people is that that lasts for a while, and then it goes away. And that is a really traumatic process for them—particularly if they've become kind of high on their own supply, and they believe that they're a superior sort of person. You know, "Why—I'm pressing the gas pedal and the car's not moving forward anymore," and they can't understand it. And that does often, I think, lead people to kind of bitterness and resentment rather than a kind of appreciation of, "Most people don't get one hot streak. Maybe I won't get two, but the one I had was pretty good." So this is a good segue to talk about The Beatles and the music or creativity streaks where either you're hot, and then suddenly you're not. And I guess part of—we have been, I don't know, and I'm assuming broad social trends in Britain are similar to America—but certainly over the past 30 or 40 years, we have been pushing galaxy brain ideas on schoolchildren and things like that. You know, the idea that you have a domain-specific genius or intelligence doesn't seem to be in favor. We talk about general intelligence, and it's kind of like if you're good at one thing, you're going to be good at everything. So—I mean, we're kind of reaping that whirlwind. I'm not even sure I'm using that term properly, but—because people like Elon Musk are told when they're a kid, "Well, you are really smart. You do great on standardized tests, so everything you say—you get an A in every subject." So like, why wouldn't you start talking about fertility or something like that? So let's talk about the Beatles a bit. How did The Beatles—I mean, it's fascinating, you know, Shakespeare and The Beatles are like the two great British exports, right? Yeah, yeah. And I really appreciate your focus on the way that all of this stuff plays into national myth-making and things like that. When you talk to French or German people, they're like, "Yeah, Shakespeare's pretty good, but he's not great." English-speaking people—and Americans, I think, probably love Shakespeare more than English people—because we have spent, you know, a couple hundred years trying to be like, "No, Melville—he's as good, and Walt Whitman." During graduate school, I studied American literature, and it was fascinating—right around the time that the Berlin Wall came down and then the Soviet Union collapsed. And suddenly, Americanists who had been spending 50 years searching for the American Shakespeare were finally like, "Hey, you know what? We don't actually have to worry. Britain is now a minor literature because America is—our literature matters because we're the world power. We don't have anything to apologize for on some level." But roundabout way of getting to the Beatles—like, you particularly talk about how, within the Beatles mythology, John is seen as the kind of genius, and Paul is—you know, he's like the job, right? He's just a hard worker. What goes into that, and why do you pick Paul over John? Well, for a start, I say this slightly incendiary line, which is: I think in terms of their long-term reputation, we're very lucky that it's Paul who's made it to 80, and John is now a hallowed memory. Because I think if John were still around, he'd be an extremely grumpy reactionary—probably doing quite bad tweets. That would be glorious, though. Whereas Paul McCartney has grown into that kind of father-of-the-nation role, and the younger musicians can make pilgrimage to him. Oh, and it's interesting—I'm sorry to interrupt—but I know George Harrison, who's also important in this kind of holy trinity. And you realize, as age goes on, that Ringo is the only Beatle really worth caring about in the long run. But— Ringo is lovely in Get Back, right? One of my friends described him as being like this sort of lovely Labrador. He's actually like a sort of emotional support animal—because he's there, just exuding Ringo energy. He calms everything down because people don't want to have a row in front of Ringo. And they don't want to upset Ringo. And actually, that is an underrated skill in the high crucible of tempestuous creative motion. Well, but George—towards the end of his life, by the '90s—he was grumpy. When Oasis openly paid a compliment to him by talking about "Wonderwall," which is a reference to his first—or near first—solo album, he was like, "Oasis sucks." He hated everybody younger than him. He was grouchy and grumpy. I mean, Oasis's reputation has not stood the test of time, has it, as a… No, I don't think so. They were— They had a lot of concerts. I think that might be an interesting one to see when people have their own music. Well, and they have their own—that's a variation, right, on the genius theme. The brother who writes everything is really the genius. I mean, they're doing the version of The Kinks with Ray Davies and Dave— Right. And two people who hate each other because they've both got something the other hasn't, right? Liam hates Noel for being able to write songs. And Noel hates Liam for being the charismatic frontman. Anyway, but there's a similar version of that with John and Paul, where John is cast in the role of being the rock bad boy. And that's what people kind of want at the time from their singers. Whereas Paul is seen as kind of domestic and managerial and a bit of a boring admin guy. And his songs focus on mundane stuff, whereas John is writing much more surreal and whimsical stuff—and that's seen as more creative. So you see by the end of the breakup that they've been put into those two categories, and that John has got the much more flattering one. But I don't think it would necessarily— —from a kind of romantic demonic—you know, like the Romantics loving Satan. John is that kind of rock creative genius. Yeah, exactly. Untamable, weird, odd. You know, him and Yoko were kind of wandering around filming their bottoms and all that kind of stuff. He's performing a much more obvious genius role. Whereas Paul McCartney has gone to live on a Scottish island, and send his kids to a public school, and wanting to be, quote, "as normal," right? Trying to live as normal a life as a rock star could live. And therefore—one of the things—I was just talking to a playwright last week about the book. And I said, the thing is, people would rate you as more talented if you were just weirder. You're too normal. You should try and cultivate an aura of eccentricity, because people would misread it as brilliance. I want to get to two other points before we stop talking. And I guess the first is: it's called The Genius Myth. Part of it—I can hear people being like, "Oh, you're just putting down anybody who accomplishes things. You are cutting down the tall poppy or whatever." The Canadian band Rush has a great song called "The Trees," which is about how all the maple trees are trying to keep this oak from growing taller than them. And, you know, they were in an Ayn Rand phase when they produced that. The maple leaf must be the regular Canadian, and they just don't want, you know, Rush to become too big. But it's about the myth, you know. How did you become interested in not the things that people do that are interesting, but in the way that it ends up being talked about? I think people in groups are completely fascinating. Because—I don't know about you—but I find it hard enough to understand individual people. The fact that they think in completely different ways to me. And just—things that to me are completely obvious, they just disagree with me on. And it's kind of life's project to be like, "Oh—other people's brains are different." But then you add in the complexity of them being in crowds, and it becomes completely impossible to understand why people do the things that they do. So lots and lots of my writing—about political movements, about social change—focuses on exactly those kinds of weird emergent properties of people in groups. And that's what interested me about this: you don't get to declare yourself a genius. You can try, right? Lots of people have. And quite a lot of them have been cruelly rebuffed. But genius is created by a crowd looking at you and adoring you and hailing you. And therefore, the interesting question is not just to talk about the properties of the people who are being adored, but the properties of the crowd. So I'm always really interested in celebrity—- Yeah, you talk about Elon Musk in the beginning of the book as an argument about what society values, but also what we're willing to tolerate because it's this whole pact. How did we get to a point where we're going to say—and this is an older example—but it's like, "Well, Roman Polanski deserves to fuck any child that he wants because he made Chinatown." I mean, generally, that is the way that people used to talk about it. They used to say that it was— That's how Bernard-Henri Lévy, the great human rights advocate, said it when Polanski was arrested in Switzerland and was going to be deported to the U.S. Yeah, or like, "It's not rape rape," or, you know, all these kind of weaselly things. Or, "It was Philistines"—that's what one French actress said: "You're Philistine," and then this campaign of smearing against him. And you're like, I'm going to stay at this wild position that I don't think it's good to drug and sexually assault teenagers. Just call me a prude, if you will. And to confess to that. He pled guilty and then he fled because he was worried that the plea bargain that was in place might not come through on the terms that he wanted. To talk about the kind of people who helped create the myth—you have a great chapter, and I'm misreading the title because I don't have it, but it's about the widow of the genius. You talk about people like Orwell's wife, but I'm especially interested in talking about Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, who was an artist—plausibly of equal talent, potentially—but she kind of consciously, ultimately played a role of saying, "OK, I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to kind of build up his myth." Can you talk a little bit about that? And also, one of the things that I find fascinating—this is about your work in general—but it's particularly strong in this book— the gender dimension to all of this. Because geniuses—when you think of a genius, you think of a boy genius. You don't think of a girl genius. Oh, the Romantics were quite explicit about this. They thought genius was a male property, but it was a man who had a kind of feminine spirit within him. You know, this was the idea of a poet. But they're not girls. No. It was fae, sort of feminine men—but never butch ladies. No, that was not the same at all. So those roots of the gendering of genius are really, really deep. And I think there's pretty good research that says we're more likely to describe boys as brilliant. That is just an adjective that we apply more readily to men than to women. But is that something relatively recent? And then it becomes hard because in terms of, if we're talking about harder-core patriarchal structures…I had a conversation with Richard Dawkins once where he was talking about various things, and I was just like, "Yeah, it's really weird to me that, like, girls—you look back in human history and girls just couldn't pole vault until about 1985. Is that because of biology?" I grew up in a world, in high school, where girls were not allowed to participate in the pole vault because they couldn't do it. Evolution did not allow them to have the upper body strength to pole vault. How many times do you recognize things that are treated as facts of nature are obviously social constructions and change? And I'm not denying differences between men and women— Oh sure. No, I'm sure women are worse at pole vaulting, right? They do not do as well. It's definitely sex-linked. What I'm getting at is the question of girl and boy geniuses—because we now live in an age where, you know, the equality of sex is certainly under the law. And even in places where testing is used, you know, girls do better in high school, girls get into college more often, they graduate college more often. Are we going to look forward to a future of girl geniuses that are as insufferable as the boy ones? Well, that's the final dream of feminism, isn't it? To be as insufferable as men. Yeah, I don't know—because I think that's a really interesting question. There are undoubtedly women who have really high achievement in ways that they were previously blocked out of. But there's still an open question about whether or not there are sex differences in the kind of selfishness and ambition that's required to be like a William Shockley. Actually—are these traits that we really want to encourage in our children? The kinds of things that make you the Nobel-winning scientist? Or—that's also an interesting question about the fact that science has changed so much. There's very little low-hanging fruit that one person can now do. Most great science projects now are deeply collaborative—often across countries. But it's also about who the crowd wants to hold up as the genius. And I still think that both men and women are more reluctant to idolize women. So I don't think it necessarily will level out, actually. Because again, it's not an objective awarding of a quality—it's not something awarded on merit. It's about why you are celebrating someone—because of what it says about you, or what it says about the qualities you want to stress. So, you know, we definitely do have more women who are celebrated now. And also—the other thing I would say about, to go back to Lee Krasner—my editor made a very good note in that chapter which I incorporated. She has been the benefit of a explicitly feminist genius myth. Which is that feminist historians love the idea of finding overlooked women and lifting them up and celebrating them. You see that with Artemisia Gentileschi, the Renaissance painter. You see it with Krasner. And so there are a new set of genius myths, which are sometimes in themselves quite reductive—the poor, downtrodden woman who never got her flowers during her life, and now we're here, as the historical court of appeal, to make that right. So yeah, there will be some women who benefit from that. But I would doubt that it will level out anytime soon. What kind of pushback do you face when you bring up the social context of the creation of things like genius? Part of what your book is that there's a line or chapter like, "There really is no lightbulb moment." That Edison, tried a million different things, and all these people, etc. But you—for you—you certainly burst into a bigger view when, it was in 2018, when you had that great interview with Jordan Peterson. Yeah, what I like to do is confuse people by getting attacked from a completely different political tendency every couple of years and just switching it up. So, you know, there are people who've spent the last couple of years thinking that I'm this anti-woke conservative. And now I'm going to go through a phase where they think—I think you're right. The people who don't read the book will think this is some misguided egalitarian feminist nonsense that says, "Everybody can be Monet. Everybody can be Einstein. Everybody can be Picasso," or whatever it might be. So yeah, I think that there will be misreadings like that. You can only write the book. You can't force people to read it, tragically. It's a better world where authors cannot force people to read— I was going to say I couldn't read his book, but yeah. Well, he could get you to hold it up, right? And I guess Gaddafi did that too, right? He had his little Green Book—that's all over. I'm sure it's still in the basements of the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi or whatever. But, you know, with that Jordan Peterson interview—what is amazing, like, when it came out, I watched it, and I was like, "OK, this is really—it's just great journalism." I mean, to your credit—what was funny to me, and more clear on a second viewing—is just that you're asking basic questions. And he is a male genius, and he uses ratiocination, he is incredibly learned—but it's like he's about to cry half the time. He is so emotional. Do you think we've entered into a period where men—the kind of male recourse to anger—is now being recognized less as, you know, genius and more as a failure to cope with what's going on in the circumstance? I hope that's true, because I know what you mean—particularly the kind of plethora of those very cruel videos of people having public meltdowns. I think you often see men melting down in public in a way that suggests they've just never learned to process and manage feelings of humiliation or denial, in a way that's quite unhealthy. And I think everybody would probably benefit from working a bit harder on that. But I'm pleased that you picked that up, because I do think it was very funny—because, you know, that was explicitly set up, that interview with Peterson— This was like—if I may make an analogy—this is like when Playboy sent a Black interviewer to General William Shockley. Sending GQ—sending a woman—to interview Jordan Peterson. For their Men of the Year issue. And that's the thing that's very funny, because everybody wanted it to be me—this kind of emotional little lady—and him to be the Great Man of Science loftily delivering his insights. But as you say, I'm there being quite sarcastic, because that's how I brawl. And he's the one who's kind of tearing up. It was actually very gender-nonconforming in that sense. So credit to everyone involved there. He fits into this category. He obviously toiled in the groves in the academy for a long time and had developed a certain kind of expertise and a certain level of reputation. And then when he broke big, now he's giving people tips on how to tie their tie and things like that. Yeah. I was talking to someone who knew him, actually, in Toronto earlier this week. And they said, you know, he was—he was this really great. Like, the research was really good, and the teaching was really good, and his students really liked him. Everybody who knows him from that period in his life is like, "Oh, you were a really great psychology professor, but you are probably not psychologically suited to be an internet commentator." Some people just have hides of inch-thick leather and that sort of thing bounces off of them. But clearly he's somebody who really takes criticism to heart, and it affects him quite deeply. And he's really not cut out for sprawling with people on the internet. Can I ask before—and I promise we'll get to Musk and then I'll let you get on with your day, or tea, or whatever you people are doing in England now—curtsying— —my crumpets —as you drive by… In your previous book Difficult Women, which is excellent—I'm a big fan of kind of second-wave feminism, which now gets read out of context. You read women like Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol, and they're read out of context. Obviously, she shouldn't have shot Andy Warhol. She should have shot Norman Mailer if she understood her own theory. That would've been great. But what I'm saying is, second-wave feminism from the late '60s and early '70s often gets read in a void. So it just seems like these shrieking harpies who are talking about castrating men, etc., and it's always taken out of context. Like, yeah, they were denied entry into universities or jobs, etc. One of the figures you've talked about a fair amount is Germaine Greer. Talking about Norman Mailer—I mean, if you ever watch the live debate, she just rocks. She throws her fox fur stole over her shoulder and starts talking about building cathedrals in this über-academic way. I mean, it's… oh, I love it. Yeah. No—I mean, you could power all the energy needs of the developing world with the sexual tension… It is really quite something. Germaine Greer, does she fall into a problem of—she was hot, she had a moment. Do you think her thought isn't on a hot streak anymore? It's kind of a amazing because she helped define, certainly in England, second-wave feminism, and now she seems to be hated by most feminists. How does genius age? Oh, I don't think that's true in Britain, where she lived most of all—I mean, she's originally Australian. I think because of the transgender revolt of the last 10 years, she became very unfashionable with the people who came of age at that time. She was seen as being insufficiently inclusive of transgender women. But I think in Britain, the scales have tipped back toward—whatever you want to call it—sex realism, gender-critical feminism. People are now also rediscovering their love of Germaine Greer's brutal, radical honesty, I think we might call it. Personally, my favorite Germaine is not "Why I think naked boys are attractive" Germaine—that was a strange Germaine—nor even the Germaine of The Whole Woman or The Female Eunuch. But her writing on art criticism—she wrote a book about female painters called The Obstacle Race, which I read when I was revising this. As a scholar I think she's got another one called something like Kissing the Rod, which is about Restoration poetry. It's a very Germaine Greer title. She was an exceptional close reader of texts and paintings. And I wonder, actually, when the outrage about her comparing trans women to spaniels has all died down—we will remember the quality of her thoughts. In the same way that people now appreciate—you mentioned Valerie Solanas, but I'm thinking more of Andrea Dworkin. Penguin has just reissued all of Andrea Dworkin's work. Because it's now been long enough that people have kind of gotten over themselves about her controversies and remembered the interesting contributions that she made. But this comes exactly to what the whole book is about, which is: all of that depends on a generation of women—my age or below—who want to remember her, who want to keep enshrining her. This idea of history as a process—you know, we want to keep her memory and what she wrote alive. That's ultimately where the historical judgment comes from. It's whether or not the next generation thinks you're important. It seems to me that Britain has more—you know, and I use this term with air quotes—"TERFs" than American feminism. I think America maybe has a lot of… If you want to define it like this—80 percent of America thinks that sex matters and that there is a difference between trans women and women. Right? But those are none of— Yeah—none of that implies a different legal standing or anything like that. I have struggled. There's a tradition of French feminism, which is its own thing, and then Anglo-American feminism. I found it interesting, I guess, that there are very few American feminists who are on a Germaine Greer level—who exist and are talking publicly about this. Do you have a quick gloss on why it seems like second-wave feminism stuck around longer in England than it did in America? I think it's probably because of the trade union movement and the left feminist movement. Whereas in America, things became much more polarized. And also I think that in America, because abortion dominated the conversation for so long—and continues to dominate it—everybody gets sucked into that. There isn't a lot of space for other stuff. Plus, stuff like employment law being so much more federal in America—what are the kind of big…? And again, in America, race has been such a big part of the conversation for so much longer. I mean, Britain is now a much more diverse country than it was. But in the '90s, it was still 95 percent white. These are just much more recent questions about whether or not feminism is, quote, "white." In 1920, that wasn't a question in British feminism because everybody was white. Whereas it was a huge deal in America. So I think all of those social factors might account for it. I was just thinking as you were talking about England being blessedly white even into the 1990s. Whoa, whoa, whoa—I didn't say that! I was going to say—if you're looking for supplementary material for the eventual paperback edition of this, it would be great to look at Eric Clapton as a genius who then went on to a bit of racial… Very Shockley. A very Shockley trajectory. Like, "Oh, so you loved 'Layla'? Would you also like to hear my thoughts on race?" No—just play "Layla" again. That was really great. And he also has a few thoughts on COVID. I'm sure John Lennon would have had his few thoughts on COVID, I'm just saying. Well, yeah. This is where I think John Lydon—or Johnny Rotten—is kind of… he's a very stable genius, because whatever is dominant thinking, he will be on the other side of it at any given moment in time. But let's talk about Musk quickly. He's not the controlling metaphor of your book, but he is the controlling genius of our moment. Do you think his recent foray into politics—does that tarnish him? Because I was thinking: there's a science writer based in Canada named Dan Gardner. He has a fabulous Substack called Past, Present, Future, or something like that. He wrote a lot about Henry Ford. And he was like, "Hey, I want to tell you a story about a carmaker who really kind of blew his reputation by talking about stuff he didn't really know anything about." And it's about Henry Ford, who was a great genius at mass production and all of this kind of stuff. And then he got bored running a car company, and he's like, "OK, I'm going to solve World War I." And didn't he become a massive antisemite? Oh, he was. He is the Bob Dylan of antisemites. I don't know who's the ultimate Jew. He went electric. Yes, absolutely. And then he also ended up suing people who libeled him for describing him accurately, and then losing status in public court hearings. Because he's an idiot about all of this kind of stuff. Where does that story go? Because he is the epitome of galaxy brain. It's like: he's good at these things, so every thought he has is good, and we have to put up with him. You know, he was working for an administration where people want to have more kids and be Christian. We don't know how many children he has—virtually none of them in a marriage setting. He's divorced, and increasingly it's not even clear how many there are or under what circumstances they were born. That's one thing people tolerate—because he's good at making money and making cars. But then this political foray, where he's going back to Texas—is that the type of thing that destroys his geniusness, or does it remain to be seen? I mean, I think it does. How I've always felt about it is: SpaceX, which is the truly innovative business—if it manages to make reusable rockets work in that way that drives down the cost of space travel, that allows us to become an interplanetary species—I would have thought, in 400 years' time, we're not going to be talking about his bad tweets. But at the current rate, I think he deeply risks falling into that Shockley pattern—of somebody whose juice kind of runs out. Because look at the DOGE as we're talking, he's just been giving this round of kind of exit interviews complaining it was a lot harder than he thought it would be. And you know how he could have found out how hard it would have been? He could have asked me—an idiot—to tell him that. The fact is, governments are harder to run than private businesses, because you can't have creative destruction. You can't just let a government fail and someone else move in—people die, people don't get their Social Security checks. These are important things. But instead, he trampled through that undergrowth like a huge rhino, insistent that he knew best. And—shock horror—if he'd gone into that with his undoubted skills, but had learned more first, he would have been more successful at it. Well, from a Reason angle, it was frustrating, because there are people who work at Reason—but also there's a whole Gulag Archipelago of think tanks—of people who have said, "This is how you cut government spending and waste," etc. And, like, there are almost off-the-shelf plans you can bring in as opposed to going in and not succeeding. Ones that are increasingly picking up traction on the left, right? If you look at the whole abundance agenda—a lot of that is really saying, places like California don't work because they overregulate. What's that phrase of Ezra Klein's? "Everything bagel liberalism"—where it's like, "Why don't we make this housing project also solve racism and wild birds?" So there's definitely a libertarian critique that people feel government is slow and sclerotic. And a more humble man might have read those things first. The point with Musk is that—I guess this is part of where geniuses go to destroy themselves—they really don't think that, as your book argues—and I think it's completely persuasive—that breakthrough technologies are never the result of one person. But when you get exalted like that, then you stop looking around for the expertise or the team that will actually help you produce results. Then you're looking for yes men, or people who will… Your circle becomes—you become Kanye West or something, where nobody around you is going to say no. Yeah. And I think the really interesting examples of that—Picasso and Einstein are probably our most obvious examples. Most people's go-to ideas of artistic and scientific genius. But Einstein never really accepts quantum mechanics. So when he dies, he's more a celebrity than the kind of person in the field that young physicists look to. And Picasso similarly doesn't go to pure abstraction—he doesn't end up in the place of Rothko. That's because they had their paradigm shift. They had the moment where they were the perfect brain to meet the moment. And I think you probably see something very similar with Musk. He had a playbook—which, if you read Character Limit, the book about his takeover of Twitter—you know, he brings in his lieutenants, they lock everybody out of the systems, they fire everyone and rehire that they need. He just had this way that had worked for him in the past. And he went, "Bring on big balls, I'm going to do that to the government too." And he didn't realize that it was not the same environment, and that his one thing that had worked before would now not serve him anymore. And that, to me, exactly is what you're saying. It's a classic genius myth: you think, "I've got the answer," not realizing that different questions have different answers. Right. Yeah—and to go back to that idea of domain-specific intelligence or expertise: not everything is like everything else. That was one of the great myths in American capitalism in the mid-20th century that was destroyed—the idea that all businesses, regardless of what you produce, can be managed by a set of professional managers who are trained in management. And it turns out shipbuilding is very different from oil production, which is different from newspapers, and all of that. If I may—are there good examples of geniuses who run into the wall that Musk has driven his Tesla into with Dogecoin and everything—who then come back? Are there Paul McCartneys, whose second truth or last two-thirds of a career are actually as good or as interesting as the first third? That's a really good question. And I'll probably have to give it more thought than I'm able to on the hoof, because— I'll tell you what—I can't think of any examples offhand, but as you're saying that, I can totally see what a great story that is. And how much people would love that story. So there probably are examples of it. I'm thinking of the kid who was the actor in Indiana Jones who then didn't really do anything for ages and then won the Oscar for Everything Everywhere All at Once. People love that idea that this is the ultimate comeback story. So I can see that happening, where someone had been piddling away for a while and then came back with something. But I don't know. The best versions, I think, of people are your McCartneys or your Springsteens—or, you know, I went to see the Pixies last week. People who just carry on doing something because they clearly love it, the fans love it, and they enjoy it. And the Pixies gig was very interesting, because clearly people were there to hear the songs primarily from Surfer Rosa, their 1980s album. And they play those quite happily. Then they play some of their new stuff too. And I just thought: this is quite a good acknowledgment of: this was the moment we were hottest. We're not in that moment now. But we don't hate those people or resent that. We love that it happened. We're not sad that it didn't go on forever. That is fascinating. Yeah, I started my career as a teen magazine and rock music journalist. And there's nothing worse than bands or artists who hate the work that made them famous. It's an awful life. It's sad, isn't it? It's really sad. It is. And there are people—I'm thinking of someone like Nick Cave or Bob Dylan. They're very different, but Dylan refused to go away. He goes through cycles where stuff starts to make sense, even if it seems horrible the first time. And Cave has certainly been growing as an artist. And someone like Madonna—I think she stopped, in a way, but had a fantastic run. Can I just real quickly do a bit of biography? Because you mention at one point—and I thought this was fascinating in the book—that your father, in the '50s, took one of these inscrutable-to-Americans O-levels or A-levels, or whatever. I've read a ton of Beatles biographies, and they're always talking about how "I ruined my A-levels," and I have no idea what they're talking about. It's not easy to understand—like SATs. Yeah, no, of course—which is its own kind of bullshit. But your father did well on a test, and that meant that he got to go to university. What is your background, and how did you get to be where you're at? So the test you're talking about is the Eleven-Plus, which kids took at the age of 11. At the time—this is after… so my parents were both born in 1945—so this is in the aftermath of the Second World War. The idea was, if you came from a working-class family—and any other kind of family—that they were going to try and make higher-level education more accessible to a greater number of people. But the way to do that was by selecting viability. So you took this test at 11, and if you passed it, you went to a grammar school. If you didn't, you went to what was called a secondary modern or a technical school. The idea was that you either had an academic education or a vocational one based around going into trades. Because at 11—come on—the bread is baked, right? Well, that's a big… I mean, we mentioned Lewis Terman a long time ago. He also, earlier than that, thought that you could kind of pick future winners very early. And that's not always possible. The other thing it did was create—you know, you'll hear people today will say, "the Eleven-Plus was amazing because I got chances that I wouldn't otherwise got." But that's a kind of survivorship bias, because you don't hear as much from the people whose lives were ruined by being told at 11 they were not good enough. But in his case, it meant he was the first in his family to go to university. He went to Aston University in Birmingham to study chemistry. He worked first for Worcester Porcelain—where I grew up, which has its own delightful porcelain—and then for a place that made things you melt steel in—crucibles. Sorry, I know you're loving how much of an English stereotype I am, aren't you? Yeah. "It has a delightful bone china—from the Potteries." But you know, he benefited—definitely—he got lifted up like that. And on my mum's side, my granddad, who was Scottish, he was a coal miner. He moved south and took civil service exams as an adult. So he was the engine, he moved from working class to middle class, at that point. My mum then went to the same school I ended up going to, which was a convent school, a Catholic school. So I came from a really nice, normal middle-class high school. This was in the Midlands in England. I didn't know anybody who was a journalist. I didn't know anybody who lived in London. Even Birmingham was quite exciting to me. So I do have to remind myself every so often: if I could go back and talk to 16-year-old me about what I do and who I know, she would be pretty impressed. It is kind of fascinating, isn't it? There's a version of this in the U.S.—and I think throughout the West, and even much of the developing world—where tests, whether they're IQ tests or aptitude tests, they're used in many ways to reinforce the status quo or to naturalize it. But oftentimes, the goal—even when they were implemented—was not necessarily to do that, but to be more egalitarian and more meritocratic. Intelligence needs to be contextualized, and things like that. You know… Well, it's not necessarily a bad impulse, is it? Because actually, the signature event in my academic career was that I went to Oxford University, and that was determined— I said… A little place, yeah, in the Cotswolds. But that wasn't determined by a test for English—that was determined by an interview. And you know what? That obviously privileges eloquent bullshitters. The die was cast in my future in podcasting, because that's exactly what that selects for. Tests are bad in some ways, but they're also sort of… they're the worst thing apart from all the other things. We haven't yet invented a way of designing education that weeds out bias. The Eleven-Plus was notoriously problematic because it was easier for middle-class kids to pass it. They had more knowledge. Often just flat-out their parents hired tutors to get them through it. Now what happens is that there are very few grammar schools left, and the house prices around them are exceptionally high. So you end up with class sorting by who can afford to buy a house in that area. I mean, that's… to talk about the abundance agenda. And I always think when I hear about Ezra Klein, I'm like: If you want to read what Ezra Klein is going to write tomorrow, read what Reason was publishing 20 years ago. But part of it is—when it comes to educational opportunity and whatnot—the idea that, well, there are only 10 universities. So we have to sort to get the right people into that. It's like, maybe you create a world where there are many, many different universities—or more schooling opportunities—rather than funneling people through. In America, there was starting to retreat—not necessarily for good reasons—but there was this birth of gifted and talented programs. And most of the time, it wasn't just like, "If you hit this level of testing, you'll be in the gifted and talented program." It's like, "We only have a certain number of slots." And, well—if the test says you're gifted and talented, why don't you expand the program? But oftentimes, the function of schooling is not to increase opportunity, but to maintain the existing power structure. That's my idea. No, I know. And there's loads of stuff that happens like that. The Ivy Leagues, which excluded or limited Jewish students in the first half of the 20th century, they did that by saying, "We want to look at well-rounded students." Or they moved their recruitment pools out of New York City and into the outer boroughs—or whatever it might be. That's the only way I think T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound got into Ivy League schools—because they were from Missouri and Idaho. So they benefited from the geographical quota. But this is one of the big themes of the book: a level of humility about the systems we have and whether or not they are free from bias. And when the things that look natural and inevitable to us are actually the result of things we can't see—because, yeah, there are a lot of invisible hands. And actually, sometimes, extremely visible hands, if you care to look for them. Yeah, the Ivy Leagues now have a different way of keeping Jews off campus, right? So they—you know, it's more visible. This is not the first time that America's had debates about affirmative action. It just used to be that the affirmative action was in favor of WASPs in the 1920s. Yes, and I'm glad to live in a post-WASP America, for the most part. Just a final question about your method. Have you ever been called a genius? Hm. Why? One of the things that I find remarkable in your work—both the podcasting but then the writing work. I always take this as a sign of an excellent journalist—and I don't really care about "geniuses" is that you find a topic and then report out on it. And that way, you don't have to worry about a hot streak or a cold streak, because the onus isn't on you to be a genius all the time or to come up with new and novel things to say. You go out into the world and see what's happening. That seems to me that's a very rare model for journalism—but it obviously seems like the best way to do it. It's a great relief to just be like, "I am not actually that interesting. What I do is, I go and put myself in interesting places and meet interesting people—and I will tell you about them." And like you say, I'm surprised more people don't do it, because it's a huge burden off you. If you're not trying to be the main character in your drama—if you're content to be the amanuensis at the side—then yeah, it's a huge weight off your shoulders. And I think this is what drives a lot of modern journalists kind of mad: if you're only telling a story in which you're the protagonist, then you need to keep doing stuff. And actually, just go and talk to other people. Other people are mad. They say crazy things. That's Tom Wolfe, in the introduction to his collection The New Journalism, which was about stuff from the '60s and early '70s, published in the early '70s. He said that, "it was amazing. So many weird things were happening in America, and all you had to do was go out and hang out with people." He's seen as someone who's a genius—he has genius insights and is a stylist—but he says in plain sight:" just go and talk to people who are doing things you think are interesting." And you are interesting. It's also just the most fun. I mean, there's nothing that makes me happier than being in some random bit of backstreet America, just talking to people whose life experiences are completely different from mine. And I wish more people got the opportunity to do it, to be honest. The color that you add to, you know, talking about going to—or witnessing—one of the SpaceX launches or recoveries is brilliant. You know, because it's out in the world. It's wonderful. I have kept you overlong—I apologize for that. Where are the best places people should look for your work? You can find most of it through my Substack, which is helenlewis.substack.com. And also my longer, more considered work is at The Atlantic, who are very kind in giving me—the thing that I really like about working for them is that they invest in you as a person. And like you say, reporting is the best and most fun thing to do. And it's not the easiest thing to do in journalism at the moment. So I give them huge credit for letting me—letting me be my best self. God, that sounded like therapy. Sorry—what a hateful note to end on. I'm going to go and have, like, a muffin and a crumpet and be overly British. Yeah, maybe talk about Princess Diana and how sad it is. Are you up on the royals? Do you like the royals? Oh, yeah. I know. There was a time during the Prince Harry saga where I was threatening to become The Atlantic's royal correspondent, just because I enjoy writing about them. And by God, do Americans love reading about them. I don't understand that. And I think Harry was best when he was following in—was it Edward VII or VIII?—when he was doing the Nazi costumes. I was going to say, "being a Nazi." It's all been downhill for him since then. Helen Lewis, thank you so much. It was a real delight talking to you. The Genius Myth is a spectacular book. It's the best thing you've written recently—until the next one. So thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Title: NYSE: ELV DEADLINE REMINDER: Berger Montague Reminds Elevance Health (NYSE: ELV) Investors of Important Class Action Lawsuit Deadline

June 04, 2025 10:52 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, June 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the “redetermination” process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the cost profiles. Defendants acknowledged rising Medicaid expenses, yet assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. In truth, however, the redeterminations were causing the utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was not adequately reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024. To learn your rights or for more information, CLICK HERE or please contact Berger Montague: Andrew Abramowitz at aabramowitz@bm.net or (215) 875-3015, or Peter Hamner at phamner@bm.net. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member. Berger Montague, with offices in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Delaware, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago, has been a pioneer in securities class action litigation since its founding in 1970.

Title: Cuts to USAID severed longstanding American support for Indigenous people around the world

The effort to protect the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade was long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development NEW YORK -- Miguel Guimaraes Vasquez fought for years to protect his homeland in the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade, even laboring under death threats from drug traffickers. A leader in an Indigenous rights group, Vasquez said such efforts were long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which spent billions of dollars starting in the 1980s to help farmers in Peru shift from growing coca for cocaine production to legal crops such as coffee and cacao for chocolate. The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets. But the Trump administration's recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights. “We don’t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,” said Vásquez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. "We think the situation is going to get worse.” Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. “We really needed those resources,” he said. When Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world. USAID’s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change. That included Vásquez's organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. Vásquez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration. In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs. “Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in March. “Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.” Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation. Former USAID employees said political pressure from the U.S. often kept foreign governments from violating some Indigenous rights. In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It's now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government. The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country's agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. “The impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,” Vásquez said. The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE’s cuts to USAID a “mindless” setback to years of work. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. USAID’s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger. One of the most recent additions to USAID’s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy. Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank. “That provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,” Rieser said. “That has now been silenced.” That adviser position remains unfilled. Vy Lam, USAID's adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden's administration. He said concepts such as “free, prior and informed consent” — the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights — were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy. One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments. For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation. “We had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,” Lam said. U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area. In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses. Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N. At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy. In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant. In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings "are actual victims of human rights violations,” Flores said. “For someone who’s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it’s really just an injustice.” ___ This story was published in partnership with Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

June 04, 2025 09:17 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after it overtook Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world’s most valuable company again. Nvidia shares are rising nearly 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, after it edged out Microsoft in market cap on Tuesday, closing up nearly 3% to $141.22 and putting the AI chipmaker’s value at $3.444 trillion. Microsoft’s market cap was $3.441 trillion at its close Tuesday. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple (AAPL) have been jostling to occupy the spot as the world’s most valuable company for nearly a year. They are the only companies to have ever achieved a market value of more than $3 trillion. Despite their gains, Nvidia’s market cap is still below its record of $3.66 trillion from earlier January when shares set their all-time high. Shares of Nvidia as well as others linked to the AI boom tumbled then when China's DeepSeek released a low-cost model that raised investor concerns about the future dominance of American AI firms. On Tuesday, Jefferies added Nvidia to its roster of “Franchise Picks,” touting the company as the “dominant supplier of AI accelerators” to data centers, facilities that house the advanced computers used to develop and train AI models.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Nearly a year after CrowdStrike's botched cybersecurity update crippled airlines, banks and hospitals for hours, the company is still reeling from the fallout. The company said on Wednesday U.S. regulators have asked it about certain transactions as well as the July 19 outage. It earlier forecast second-quarter revenue below estimates, partly due to an incentive program meant to retain customers after the outage. Its shares fell more than 5 per cent in afternoon trading. The program ended in the fourth quarter but continues to weigh on subscription growth, as it let customers pick more products or extend usage. The incentives reduced first-quarter revenue by about $11 million and will have a $10 million to $15 million impact each quarter for the rest of the fiscal year.

That has given it a lofty valuation, with shares trading at 123.69 times forward earnings estimates, compared with Palo Alto Networks' 54.01. The steep valuation left little room for any "unexpected slip-ups", said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

Title: Flock’s AI Cameras Are Watching Cars All Over America. They’re About To Get A Lot More Powerful.

ByThomas Brewster ByThomas Brewster, Forbes Staff. Flock has tens of thousands of cameras operating across almost all American states. It's now giving those devices live streaming capability, making them significantly more powerful. Flock Safety, the $7.5 billion car surveillance company, has already built a sizable AI-powered camera network, with tens of thousands of smart license plate readers monitoring roads in 49 American states. Soon its cameras are going to capture a lot more. In the fall this year, cops will be able to turn their Flock license plate readers into something more akin to traditional surveillance cameras. While Flock cameras today take photos of vehicles, flagging any car that’s on a hotlist of suspected vehicles to cops or private industry customers like FedEx or mall provider Simon Property, those same customers will soon be able to request either live feeds or 15 second clips from around the time a vehicle passed through a camera’s field of vision. Garrett Langley, Flock CEO, told Forbes that the update should give cops more “situational awareness.” Police will be able to pull up feeds from Flock cameras when a 911 call comes in, for instance, Langley said. “We will just open up the five nearest cameras in real time and say, here's what's happening right now,” he said. There will also be the option to upgrade to a camera where the angle can be adjusted, for a wider purview. “If it helps us get to our North Star of solving every single crime that happens in America, then it's a cost worth bearing.” For years, civil liberties experts have worried about Flock’s expansion. Last week, 404 Media reported that a Texas agency had used it to locate a woman who’d had a self-administered abortion across state lines. Jay Stanley, technology director at the ACLU, fretted that Flock “is trying to build a nationwide authoritarian surveillance system.” Langley, in response to those privacy concerns, said that Flock’s tech was auditable and transparent. It was down to democratically-elected individuals and groups to decide if Flock was right for them and what they do with the data the cameras collect, he said. Flock’s expansion comes on the heels of Axon Enterprise announcing a rival product to Flock’s license plate readers in April. Flock and Axon, a $59 billion market cap publicly traded cop contractor best known for making the Taser, had previously been partners, but in February, the two companies had a very public break up. Axon CEO Rick Smith said at the time that Flock was trying to lock customers into its products by making its software restrictive enough that it didn’t work as effectively with other vendors’ tools. Langley in response claimed it was Axon that had decided to be less collaborative, as evidenced by its decision to stop working with or recommending Flock. Langley told Forbes in an interview last week that he was hoping to challenge Axon’s “monopoly” by building a competitor that the market had been lacking. He claimed agencies he spoke with had become “frustrated with the monopolistic behavior that Axon has exhibited over the years and continues to exhibit, and I think that the beauty of capitalism is that it enables competition when properly enforced.” In response, Axon spokesperson Alex Engel said that Axon was a collaborative business with over 60 technology partners and integrations, which “underscores our commitment to customer choice, interoperability, and transparency.” “Axon's ecosystem is built on the belief that customers should always own and control their data,” Engel added, without mentioning Flock. Flock has been broadening its product offering for police to include drones, gunshot detection and a new software suite called Nova, which draws in information from police databases to make connections between suspects, properties or any other notable aspect of an investigation. That latter tool was built on technology Flock Safety quietly acquired in a previously unreported deal with Lucidus Tech last year. Lucidus was cofounded by former senior staff at Peregrine Technologies, a $2.5 billion startup that offers similar tech to Nova. Langley said that cops can now take information they find from Flock license plate readers and feed it into Nova to ask, for instance, if a car owner has a criminal history or any mental health conditions. For Flock, which raised $275 million earlier this year in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz, expansion also means far higher overheads. The latest update to add surveillance camera functionality could increase costs substantially when it comes to storing the video on its Amazon Web Services servers. “If it's heavily, heavily used, it will be quite expensive for us,” Langley said. “But we feel like if it helps us get to our North Star of solving every single crime that happens in America, then it's a cost worth bearing.”

Title: The FDA Launches Its Generative-AI Tool, Elsa, Ahead Of Schedule

Generative artificial intelligence has found another home in the federal government. On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the early launch of its very own generative AI that it hopes will improve efficiency. The FDA’s toolânicknamed Elsaâis designed to assist employees with everything from scientific reviews to basic operations. Originally, the FDA planned to launch by June 30, so Elsa is well ahead of schedule and under budget, according to an FDA statement. It’s not clear what exact information Elsa was trained on, but the FDA says that it didn’t use any “data submitted by regulated industry” in order to protect sensitive research and information. Currently, Elsa houses its information in GovCloud, an Amazon Web Services product specifically intended for classified information. As a language model, Elsa can help employees with reading, writing, and summarizing. In addition, the FDA said that it can summarize adverse events, generate code for nonclinical applications, and more. Per the agency, Elsa is already being used to “accelerate clinical protocol reviews, shorten the time needed for scientific evaluations, and identify high-priority inspection targets.” In a May press release announcing the completion of the FDA’s first AI-assisted scientific review, Makary said he was “blown away” by Elsa’s capabilities, which “[hold] tremendous promise in accelerating the review time for new therapies”. He added, “We need to value our scientists’ time and reduce the amount of non-productive busywork that has historically consumed much of the review process.” According to one scientist, Jinzhong Liu, the FDA’s generative AI completed tasks in minutes that would otherwise take several days. In Tuesday’s announcement, FDA Chief AI Officer Jeremy Walsh said, “Today marks the dawn of the AI era at the FDA with the release of Elsa, AI is no longer a distant promise but a dynamic force enhancing and optimizing the performance and potential of every employee.” Generative AI can certainly be a useful tool, but every tool has its drawbacks. With AI specifically, there has been an uptick in stories about Â hallucinations which are outright false or misleading claims and statements. Although commonly associated with chatbots like ChatGPT, hallucinations can still pop up in federal AI models, where they can unleash even more chaos. Per IT Veterans, AI hallucinations typically stem from factors like biases in training data or a lack of fact-checking safeguards built into the model itself. Even with those in place, though, IT Veterans cautions that human oversight is “essential to mitigate the risks and ensure the reliability of AI-integrated federal data streams”. Ideally, the FDA has thoroughly considered and taken measures to prevent any mishaps with Elsa’s use. But the expansion of technology that really needs human oversight is always concerning when federal agencies are amidst mass layoffs. At the beginning of April, the FDA laid off 3,500 employees, including scientists and inspection staff (although some layoffs were later reversed). Time will reveal how Elsa ultimately performs. But eventually, the FDA plans to expand its use throughout the agency as it matures. This includes data processing and generative-AI functions to “further support the FDA’s mission.” Artificial intelligenceFDA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: More or less
URL: https://longform.asmartbear.com/more-or-less/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T11:16:48Z

There are three viable strategies in the interplay between value and price: You see this pattern across all industries, in both consumer and business markets. More for more Cardigan by Miu Miu for â¬2,150 In clothing, for example, a cashmere sweater embodies More for moreâexpensive, but deliciously soft (enjoyment) and warm (functional). A high-end brand has a function beyond high-quality materials: Status is bestowed upon the owner, due to it being overpriced beyond its quality. Buyers are not budget-constrained, which enables high prices and correspondingly high profit margins, but customers also have their pick of options, where every other product on the planet is a competitor. The customer is in control. Hence the importance of being âthe bestâ according to some subset of the market. More for less Sweater by L.L. Bean for â¬92 More for less describes the practical decision-making that governs most purchases: Highly functional articles that will last for years, at one-fifth or even one-tenth the price of the same luxury item. Most people have a budget and therefore are seeking âThe best that I can afford.â Thus price is the primary constraint, inside which they prioritize features according to personal preference; they canât have everything, but they can prioritize everything. The productâs goal is not to be the best along every dimension, but rather to offer a set of trade-offs that enough customers prefer over other sets. Less for Less Hoodie by Tamu for â¬7 Fast-fashion vendors provide Less for less, where youâll find the article disintegrated in the washing machine by the end of the season, but hey, it was cheaper than lunch. Consumers arenât choosing between trade-offs, but rather between having a sweater, or having no sweater at all. All negatives are accepted, as there is no alternative. The vendor enjoys a massive market, but rock-bottom prices mandate extreme cost-efficiency, requiring almost non-existent marketing and sales costs, and even in the best case yields barely any profit even at scale. A competitor with a better cost structure can decimate the business. Donât worry about it. All three approaches are valid and, like all strategies, each drags along a set of consequences, some of which you despise, others you love. You must pick one approach, and accept its batch of consequences. If you donât incorporate those consequences into the rest of your strategy, youâll have a confusing market message, a Frankenstein product, and the wrong pricing model. Building âthe bestâ is wonderful for both profit and enjoyment of life. It feels good to have pride in your craft, to have customers who love what you do and agree with your superlative self-assessment. âThe bestâ commands a high price, which makes profit easier, even while self-funding further investment. This is a beautiful place to be, but it comes with consequences. âThe bestâ is not the average of a subset of things that already exist. The best is an outlier. The best is special. The best is different. Your ideas need to be substantially different from whatâs already available, or itâs definitionally not true that youâre the best. So, the first question is: The best at what? It could be anything, but it has to be specific, and customers have to agree itâs worth the higher price tag. It could be the best designâthe simplest, the most pleasant to use, the most beautiful. It could be qualityâthe peace of mind and enjoyment of a product always âjust worksâ. It could be a superior workflow, could be that it integrates with all the tools the customer uses, it could be personal tech support, and more. This article on âWillingness to payâ lists more ways of being âthe bestâ. Coupled with âbest at whatâ is âbest for whom?â There are billions of people on the planet who absolutely do not agree what âbestâ means in clothes, software, food, or articles about pricing strategy. This is where founders get fouled up; they think that just because they love it, and they âbuilt it for myselfâ and therefore âI am the customer,â and therefore other people will also to pay to solve that problem, in that way. They rarely do. The fallacies with that assumption (and some truths), are detailed here. Instead, use your initial spark of insight as the starting point, your motivation, knowing that half of it is indeed correct but half isnât, and so you go find potential customers to interview, and use a structured process to fix your hypotheses to morph your definition of âbestâ into alignment with what some specific ideal customer. Customers in this category care about something even more than they care about price. What kinds of things are like that? In business, an example is so-called âmission-criticalâ things, i.e. a failure or low quality causes outsized damage in internal cost, or far worse, damage to their reputation, in the worst case causing customers to leave.1 Something that is an urgent, top priority for them right now, whether due to emergency or strategic mandate.2 In the consumer world, it could be what Google calls a âtoothbrush productââsomething vital that is used at least twice a day, or ideally all day,3 or tied to personal identity.4 1 Our company WP Engine is an example, because we run websites like eCommerce (all of the customersâ revenue) or media (merely being slow means they lose traffic, which means they lose ad revenue) or corporate home pages (downtime costs lost leads and lower reputation). This can also be CYA, i.e. âno one ever got fired for buying ______â. 2 See this article for many examples of how this arises, and how to define your target customer and product to match. 3 Examples: to-do apps for busy people, email for people who spend more than an hour per day there, calendar apps for people whose calendars look like they only barely lost a game of Tetris, note-taking apps for people with 1000s of notes 4 Like luxury brands, where being âfar too expensiveâ is the point, like a ram with ridiculous horns. Being âthe bestâ isnât just about the product or the customer-fit; all other decisions must also be aligned with that positioning. Your marketing will focus on excellence and exclusivity rather than affordability. Your team will likely be smaller with higher-caliber individualsâpassionate artisans who take pride in creating excellence and celebrate perfectionism. When hiring, youâll focus on finding the top 1% of talent, often paying premium salaries. Your customer support isnât measured in hours but minutes, often with white-glove, personalized service and dedicated account representatives. Your product development cycles may be slower, emphasizing perfection before launch, developing features without cutting corners regardless of cost. Because the number of customers in the market is small and limited, market-share matters, and upgrading existing customers is vital for growth at scale.5 5 Many public enterprise software companies get the majority of their revenue growth from up-selling existing customers, rather than adding new ones. Fortunately, the high price tag means you can invest in these things. And if you pull it off, itâs the best for yourself because youâre fulfilled when youâre exercising your best qualities and youâre validated when others agree on Twitter and say it to your face. You can recruit great employees, because who doesnât want to work at a company whose customers actually love them? Most products are not âthe bestâ. But for those who can deliver it, it creates a virtuous cycle of excellence, satisfaction, and profitability thatâs hard to beat. Efficiency is beautiful. âMore for lessâ means receiving outsized value for a given cost. It is the right value proposition for most things in life, especially in business where you need to get a job done as cheaply as possible, but not cheaper. The global apparel industry exemplifies the claim that this is the most popular category. The âmore for lessâ category generates $1,200B of the industryâs total $1,600B annual revenue, with luxury at $250B and fast-fashion at $150B. With profit margins of 5%-15%,6 they are unsurprisingly more profitable than fast-fashion (under 5%)7 and less than luxury (20%-30%).8 âMore for lessâ software companies can have much better profit margins than apparel; coupled with reasonable prices and addressing the largest market segment, this is a great business model. 6 L.L. Bean, makers of the sweater above, is private and doesnât report profit, so this range is based on their 10% annual spend on bonuses and give-back activity and data from other retailers. 7 The outlier-most-profitable fast-fashion brand stands at 9%, but almost all are under 5%. 8 For example Prada, which makes the Miu Miu sweater above, generates 23% net profit. Which types of product benefit from high-efficiency, but doesnât require âthe best?â Perhaps almost anything. Back-end systems that operate the company but are invisible to customer are a good start, because no competitive advantage is conveyed to the company for getting âthe best.â Even more ideally, areas where downtime isnât terribly disruptive to their real-time operations; a reporting system can be down for an hour without hurting their business, but a customer support tool cannot. Or an area where itâs OK if not every desired feature is present, again like reporting software where the lack of exactly the right chart-type is not a deal-breaker, and wonât prevent them from seeing the data. Even better when the product just needs to âtick a boxâ to âsay that we have it,â because then requirements wonât be stringent. It might sound negative that your product isnât âcritical to their successâ, but being non-real-time, non-essential, also means you have far more leniency in quality or lack of features. This leniency in requirements is also why you will make 100x more sales than you expect, even though you still target the âperfectâ ideal customer with marketing and product features. For your ideal customer, you are in fact âthe best,â and they cannot believe theyâre getting the âMore for moreâ product for the âMore for lessâ price. That attitude defines them as the ideal customer; if you canât win them over from your home page, youâre not doing your job. But, for every one of those, thereâs a hundred others where youâre the right choice. You have most of what they want, you donât have any deal-breakers, and the price is right, so youâve made the sale. So, you gain the power of specificity, clarity, and emotional connection from talking to your ideal customer, while winning all the âMore for lessâ customers anyway. This article on ICPs explains this dynamic in detail, with examples. Although the main value here is economy, âsave moneyâ is weak positioning. Position by showing how much value youâre generating rather than how much money youâre saving as described in this article on positioning for value. Because, even if this is your pricing strategy, that doesnât mean itâs your marketing material. Your marketing position still needs to be as strong as possible, emphasizing that it really is more for less. As with the other pricing strategies, the rest of your decisions must be aligned. Marketing will make the customer feel like this is the âsmart choice,â neither wasting money on useless branding nor falling prey to the mistake of âIf you think this is expensive, wait until you see how expensive âcheapâ is.â Marketing must make the trade-offs clear, not try to claim itâs the best for everyone, which quietly alienates everyone; comparison charts shouldnât be a solid column of green checkmarks, but rather elucidate where you are strong, and where you are not the right solution. Product features must not be too difficult to maintain, as the price tag doesnât allow for special exceptions or for brittle integrations that only 5% of the customers use. Rather, build only those features used by at least 50% of customers, or where at least 15% of customers buy you specifically for that reason. Hire team members who excel at identifying and eliminating waste without sacrificing core value. Your whole business must reflect the âMore for lessâ mentality; your internal costs and decisions match your external promises. Pundits have long eschewed the âMore for lessâ strategy as a poor compromise between being either âthe bestâ or âthe cheapest.â As Michael Porter famously wrote in Competitive Strategy (1980), there are only three strategies: (a) Differentiated Best; (b) Low-Cost Leader; (c) Niche Leader. Later thinkers pointed out that (a) and (c) are the same, differing only in market-scope. This leaves the Porter model with what I am calling âMore for moreâ and âLess for less.â However, the customers have spoken, and in most consumer and business industries, it is in fact the âMore for lessâ category that wins most of the customers and most of the revenue and most of the profits. We must not fall prey to the incorrect attitude that this is âa balanceâ between value and cost; we should instead recognize that âMore for lessâ is a third, independent strategy, and leverage its strengths to the fullest. They say ânever compete on priceâ, but as the linked article demonstrates, that statement is incorrect. There are many wildly successful companies, from solo bootstrappers to some of the largest and most-profitable companies in the world,9 who became successful due to absolute rock-bottom prices, even though those products come with severe trade-offs that many consumers would not accept. Sometimes, âcheapestâ is âbestâ. It may seem like âless for lessâ couldnât be a good strategy, because neither employees nor consumers ought to be happy with âless,â and low prices means low revenue, which in turns means little money for marketing, sales, development, support, product, design, or fun company-culture stuff around the office.10 All that is true, and are among the consequences we accept when we adopt this strategy, but the hundreds of billions of dollars of profit (to say nothing of revenue) generated by the many âless for lessâ successes prove that these trade-offs are sometimes the right ones. 9 Examples: Amazon, Walmart, Vanguard, Costco, Dollar General, IKEA, Southwest Airlines, H&M, Zara, Xiaomi, ALDI 10 Or whatever virtual-office-substitute weâre pretending has the same effect as human beings being beings together. When something is surprisingly cheap, customers are not surprised that they have to compromise on most dimensions, such as quality, design, convenience, features, service, appearance, or longevity. Sure, itâs missing some obvious features. Sure, it doesnât integrate with Enterprise systems. Sure, customer service is going to be a set of knowledge-based articles. Sure, it sometimes crashes. What did you expect for $5 per month? There are billions of people who will buy $5 clothes that barely survive the season. If I pay $2/month for web hosting and I get email and a website, itâs okay if the email gets some spam and the website is not always fast or even always working. And I donât expect the clothing retailer to have customer service or accept returns, and I donât expect tech support from that web host to know anything beyond helping me reset my password. The fundamental reason a customer will accept a wide range of trade-offs is that the alternative is to not have the product at all. That is, the choice is between having any hoodie versus having no hoodie. The product is âbinaryâ in this senseâhaving versus not-havingâthanks to an accessible price tag. One does not quibble over âfeaturesâ or âqualityâ or âserviceâ when the alternative is ânothingâ. This is at once empoweringâsupplying goods to people who otherwise had no accessâand depressingâthat so many people cannot afford the comforts invented through modern ingenuity. And so we generate the worst versions of those items for most of the world to âenjoy.â Which viewpoint is correct? The answer can often be found in the mission and purpose behind the companyâthe real one, not the one written by the marketing department on the âAbout Usâ pageâwhere the fundamental driver of the company is either one of empowerment and impact, or one that exploits desperation. Regardless, the company should extol the positive aspects in branding and positioning: Emphasizing democratization, participation, simplicity, affordability, and accessibility. The hardest part of executing this strategy is being profitable, since thereâs so little revenue to be profitable with. The costs have to be extraordinarily, unconventionally low. Some of that can come with scale, either directly (e.g. bulk-purchases from suppliers) or structurally (e.g. tech support per customer is lower at 100,000 customers than at 100, simply because most of them donât have a question in any given month). Still, it takes a lot of $2/mo customers before you can afford to hire even a single tech support person. Or if winning a customer means winning $2/mo and maybe $50 across the entire lifetime of that customer, you canât afford to pay very much to acquire that customer, whether thatâs in direct advertising spend, or sharing revenue with an influencer,11 or indirect so-called âorganicâ marketing,12 and you certainly canât have a sales team. You must rely on word-of-mouth and reviews from customers; youâll need to encourage it. 11 Affiliates are paid only after you are paid, which means this is an affordable form of marketing from the start. 12 While harder to get customers at first, when pages arenât ranked in Google and social media accounts arenât followed by anyone, those assets do scale over time. Given that revenue will significantly lag costs, is it mandatory that such a company raise money? The company will certainly consume cash for a while, whether thatâs in the form of someoneâs savings, friends-and-family, a loan, or indeed raising money. Annual billing can help quite a bit. This is why pundits (including me) are always telling bootstrappers to âraise their pricesâ or, since you now know that prices are coupled with every other strategic decision in the company: âswitch from a âless for lessâ strategy to either âmore for lessâ or âmore for more.ââ If you donât want to raise money, donât build a business that burns money on purpose. However, itâs not true that such business need to raise an exorbitant amount of money. In fact, in the same article above, every one of the four case studies (which each grew to multiple-billion dollars in revenue) raised only a small amount of money. Those stories are detailed in the article. When the strategic decisions are fully aligned to a low-cost operation, you only need enough starter cash to get going. This is where VC-funded companies often get it wrong; they assume âwe can work the costs out later,â but when âlaterâ comes, they realize their processes, technology, and culture has solidified around whatever worked for acquiring customers, and change is either impossible or dramatically painful, like layoffs, rewriting the code that works, and trying to force unnatural marketing and sales motions. There are also examples of bootstrapped companies using this strategy who never raised money; they typically have some extreme cost advantage, such as being located in a country with extremely low costs, yet selling to the United States and Europe. Being physically located in a low-cost zone is a competitive advantage that companies in The West cannot match. As usual, what doesnât work is having a low price without the rest of the strategic decisions. This constantly happens with inexperienced founders who think: âMy product sucks, so Iâm not comfortable charging a lot.â Thatâs not a good reason, and you shouldnât just build crappy product. Instead, the question should be: How do I build a simple yet lovable product that some specific ideal customer would pay 10x more than Iâm currently charging, even though it doesnât have a lot of features, and sometimes doesnât even work? Thatâs exactly what I did with WP Engine. While the hardest intrinsic challenge is to be profitable, the hardest external challenge is that a competitor can beat you with lower prices alone. And this is all too easy, because thereâs so many reasons why a competitor might win: The antidote is to constantly increase your cost-efficiency, and possibly proactively lower prices. This is what Amazon did in retail and later did in the cloud.14 13 A particularly ironic example: Microsoft killed Netscape by putting over a thousand developers on Internet Explorer and releasing it for free; more than a decade later, Google killed Explorer by putting over a thousand developers on Chrome and releasing it for free. 14 Amazon knew from their âyour margin is my opportunityâ strategy in retail, they should proactively reduce prices as their cloud operations scaled, to prevent people from looking for alternatives. Later, when Microsoft and Google were established as the only two serious competitors, they all stopped lowering prices simultaneously. Surely a coincidence? âLess for lessâ is brutal, because of relentless competition and having no extra money to work with. But, it means accessing the largest number of potential customers, and in the best case, you are truly enriching the world by bringing goods and services to people who otherwise could not afford to enjoy them. All three pricing strategies are validâeach boasts wildly successful companies of all sizes, in every country. Ideally, one of these strategies jumps out at you as the smartest one, or at least the one youâd be the most excited and proud to implement. Another might jump out as being dumb, or at least too difficult, not worth the consequences, not where you want to spend your precious, irreplaceable time on this Earth. Listen to your gut. Because all are, in fact, smart strategies, you should pick the one that best matches your personal strengths and proclivities, because thatâs the one you will execute the best while being most fulfilled. This is another choice that increases your chance of success. The only wrong choice is to not choose at all, and thus be confusing to customers and misaligned with the rest of your strategy. Then you will make internally-inconsistent choices, working against yourself, and your customers wonât know how to think about your product, which means they wonât be comfortable buying it. And then your product is the right choice for no one. â

The best-paid CEO last year was not running a technology giant or a Wall Street firm — but the company that makes Tasers. Rick Smith, the CEO and cofounder of Axon Enterprise, which makes stun guns used by many police forces, took home almost $165 million last year. Although Smith's annual salary was $31,201, he was awarded stock options worth just over $164 million after meeting a series of targets over several years. He told The Wall Street Journal that the stock award came from a scheme open to all Axon employees that lets them convert salary into stock options, whose value depends on the share price performance. "It creates that startup kind of vibe," said Smith, who has been CEO of Axon since 1993. Axon stock is up more than a fifth over the past month after posting strong first-quarter results. The price has soared more than 700% over the past five years, leaving the company worth almost $60 billion. Smith's compensation exceeded the total for better-known S&P 500 businesses such as Starbucks or Apple, per data compiled by public company intelligence platform MyLogIQ. Second on its list was new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, who collected a $5 million bonus and stock awards worth about $90 million. Larry Culp, CEO of GE Aerospace, was third on $89 million, followed by Blackstone boss Steve Schwarzman on $84 million. Apple CEO Tim Cook collected nearly $75 million last year, including a salary of $3 million and a stock award worth $58 million, putting him in fifth place. Other names on MyLogIQ's top 20 include KKR co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall ($73 million and $64 million respectively); Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters (almost $62 million and $60 million); and Salesforce's Marc Benioff on $55 million. A study by Equilar and The Associated Press found that in 2023, the pay of CEOs in the S&P 500 rose by 12.6% year-on-year. Axon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: How Did CrowdStrike Fare In Q1?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - JUNE 01: In this photo illustration, the logo of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart visible in the background, reflecting recent trading activity and investor sentiment, on June 01, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) saw its stock fall about 7% in extended trading on Tuesday, June 3, despite reporting better-than-expected Q1 earnings. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.73 on sales of $1.10 billion, surpassing consensus estimates of $0.65 earnings per share on the same sales figure. CrowdStrike’s positive Q1 performance was overshadowed by a weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. CrowdStrike anticipates Q2 earnings of $0.82 per share on revenue of around $1.14 billion. This forecast fell short of street expectations, which projected $0.81 in earnings per share but $1.16 billion in revenue. Additionally, while Q1 revenue increased nearly 20%, the company’s adjusted operating margin plunged 500 basis points year-over-year to 18%, amid increased costs for its professional services business and higher R&D spending. On a more positive note, CrowdStrike raised its full-year earnings guidance, now expecting $3.44 to $3.56 in adjusted earnings per share, which is above the consensus of $3.43. However, it maintained its sales outlook of $4.74 billion to $4.81 billion, aligning with the consensus of $4.77 billion. The company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program. Given the upbeat Q1 results, raised full-year earnings guidance, and the share buyback program, the stock’s decline might seem puzzling. However, investors appear to be reacting to more than just the minor Q2 revenue forecast miss. CrowdStrike’s stock has surged a remarkable 40% this year, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 index's 2% rise. Trading at lofty valuations, even a slight miss on the revenue forecast was enough to unsettle investors. Now, the critical question is if CRWD stock is a buy at levels of $460. We answer this question here – Is CRWD Stock Overvalued At $460? – based on a comparison of CRWD’s current valuation with its recent operating performance and current and historical financial condition. Remember, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single stock or even a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/04/23: In this photo illustration, the CrowdStrike Holdings logo is seen displayed on ... More a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Yes, we think so. Trading at a whopping 122 times its adjusted trailing earnings, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a security software company, looks expensive. Sure, the company’s growth has remained impressive lately. But the important question is whether this valuation is justified. And we don’t think it is. Our conclusion is based on a comparison of CRWD’s current valuation with its recent operating performance and current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of CrowdStrike, across key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, reveals a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Now, to reduce stock specific risk, consider taking a look at the Trefis High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Also, see – How Did CrowdStrike Fare In Q1? CrowdStrike’s valuation appears significantly higher than the broader market, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio standing at 28.1 - well above the S&P 500’s 3.2. Our dashboard on CrowdStrike’s valuation ratios has more details. This high valuation comes despite the company demonstrating extremely strong top-line growth in recent years. Over the last three years, CrowdStrike’s revenue has expanded at an average rate of 40%, far exceeding the S&P 500’s 6.3%. Also, revenues grew 20% to $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, outperforming the S&P 500’s growth rate. Regarding profitability, CrowdStrike’s reported operating income over the last twelve months was -$252 million, resulting in a negative operating margin of -6.1%, which is worse than most companies. However, on an adjusted basis, its operating margin was a healthy 20.3% for the same period. Adjusted operating income excludes stock-based compensation and certain one-time items such as acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring costs. The company also shows strong cash generation, with an operating cash flow of $1.4 billion, leading to a high operating cash flow-to-sales ratio of 33.4%, significantly better than the S&P 500's 15.7%. CrowdStrike’s financial stability is very strong. With a debt of $785 million against a market capitalization of $122 billion, its debt-to-equity ratio is a very low 0.6%, indicating minimal reliance on debt compared to the S&P 500’s 19.0%. Furthermore, cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 billion make up 53% of its total assets, highlighting a robust cash-to-assets ratio compared to the S&P 500's 14.8%. Despite its strong growth and financial health, CRWD stock has shown weakness during market downturns. During the 2022 Inflation Shock, the stock fell 58.3%, a steeper decline than the S&P 500’s 25.4%. Similarly, during the 2020 Covid pandemic, it dropped 50.0% compared to the S&P 500’s 33.9%. While the stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peaks in both instances, its greater volatility suggests weaker resilience during market crashes. In summary, CrowdStrike shows strong performance across key financial metrics, and its profitability is good on an adjusted basis. We believe this positive performance is already reflected in the current stock price of $460, given its very high valuation. The stock trades at 28 times its trailing revenues and a significant 122 times its trailing adjusted earnings of $3.73 per share, which is much higher than its three-year average price-to-earnings ratio of about 80x. Furthermore, there’s a risk of a broader market downturn, which historically has impacted CrowdStrike’s stock more severely than the general market. Also, the growth is slowing. The consensus estimates project average sales growth of 21% over the next couple of years, compared to 40% average growth seen in the last three years. Considering these factors, we do not think now is a good time to buy CRWD stock. Investors would likely benefit from waiting for a further price dip. Surely, we could be wrong. There’s a chance investors might continue to value CRWD highly if sales grow faster than expected. But, the risk at the current valuation appears high. In fact, the risk assessment framework is something we focus on while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What's Happening With JPMorgan Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. MANHATTAN, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2025/05/15: Sign at the entrance to the JP Morgan Wealth ... More Management building in Midtown Manhattan. (Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) JPMorgan stock (NYSE: JPM) has seen an increase of approximately 11% year-to-date, in comparison to the 1% rise in the S&P 500 index during the same timeframe. In contrast, JPMorgan's competitor Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) has risen by 6% over the same duration. So, what has contributed to the strong performance of JPMorgan stock? The banking giant exceeded Wall Street expectations in the first quarter of FY 2025. Revenue for the quarter climbed 8% to $46.01 billion, driven by stronger asset management and investment banking fees, along with solid trading outcomes. Trading revenue was especially remarkable, increasing 48% to $3.8 billion. Net income rose by 9% to $14.6 billion, or $5.07 a share. The bank's asset management division has also performed well because of heightened asset prices. Assets under management jumped 15% year-over-year to $4.1 trillion. Furthermore, if you're looking for upside with a steadier experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved >91% returns since its inception. That being said, the bank has adopted a cautious stance regarding its outlook due to geopolitical factors, the U.S. imposition of tariffs on trading partners, and worries about inflation. These inflation concerns have led to an increase in treasury yields, with the 10-year yield standing at over 4.40%, up from 4.01% in early April, while the yield on the 30-year bond is just beneath 5%. This situation could have a mixed impact on JPMorgan. Increased rates and market volatility might negatively affect the investment banking sector, as they typically cause delays in IPO listings, mergers, and acquisition activities. However, from a lending perspective, higher yields expand the margin between what banks earn on loans and what they pay on deposits, which generally enhances net interest income and profitability, although there could be some effect on credit quality. Additionally, market volatility could partially be mitigated by the company’s strength in its trading operations. Currently, JPM stock is trading at approximately $265 per share, or about 2.6 times its tangible book value. Although this makes the bank appear expensive relative to its peers, this could be partially justified by its strong capital position, superior credit quality, and proactive risk management strategies, which may enable it to perform better in the current environment. JPM has also been intensifying its capital returns program. Over the last quarter, the bank repurchased $7 billion in common stock and announced a 12% increase in the common dividend. We estimate the value of JPM stock at around $240 per share, slightly beneath the current market price.

Title: The hidden time bomb in the tax code that's fueling mass tech layoffs

Time Published: 2025-06-04T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
For the past two years, it’s been a ghost in the machine of American tech. Between 2022 and today, a little-noticed tweak to the U.S. tax code has quietly rewired the financial logic of how American companies invest in research and development. Outside of CFO and accounting circles, almost no one knew it existed. “I work on these tax write-offs and still hadn’t heard about this,” a chief operating officer at a private-equity-backed tech company told Quartz. “It’s just been so weirdly silent.” Still, the delayed change to a decades-old tax provision — buried deep in the 2017 tax law — has contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-paying, white-collar jobs. That’s the picture that emerges from a review of corporate filings, public financial data, analysis of timelines, and interviews with industry insiders. One accountant, working in-house at a tech company, described it as a “niche issue with broad impact,” echoing sentiments from venture capital investors also interviewed for this article. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters. Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off, according to industry tallies. Headlines have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic and, more recently, AI. But beneath the surface was a hidden accelerant: a change to what’s known as Section 174 that helped gut in-house software and product development teams everywhere from tech giants such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) to much smaller, private, direct-to-consumer and other internet-first companies. Now, as a bipartisan effort to repeal the Section 174 change moves through Congress, bigger questions are surfacing: How did a single line in the tax code help trigger a tsunami of mass layoffs? And why did no one see it coming? For almost 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of qualified research and development spending in the year they incurred the costs. Salaries, software, contractor payments — if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it came off the top of a firm’s taxable income. The deduction was guaranteed by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. Microsoft was founded in 1975. Apple (AAPL) launched its first computer in 1976. Google (GOOGL) incorporated in 1998. Facebook opened to the general public in 2006. All these companies, now among the most valuable in the world, developed their earliest products — programming tools, hardware, search engines — under a tax system that rewarded building now, not later. The subsequent rise of smartphones, cloud computing, and mobile apps also happened in an America where companies could immediately write off their investments in engineering, infrastructure, and experimentation. It was a baseline assumption — innovation and risk-taking subsidized by the tax code — that shaped how founders operated and how investors made decisions. In turn, tech companies largely built their products in the U.S. Microsoft’s operating systems were coded in Washington state. Apple’s early hardware and software teams were in California. Google’s search engine was born at Stanford and scaled from Mountain View. Facebook’s entire social architecture was developed in Menlo Park. The deduction directly incentivized keeping R&D close to home, rewarding companies for investing in American workers, engineers, and infrastructure. That’s what makes the politics of Section 174 so revealing. For all the rhetoric about bringing jobs back and making things in America, the first Trump administration’s major tax bill arguably helped accomplish the opposite. When Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% — a massive revenue loss on paper for the federal government. To make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers needed to offset the cost. So they added future tax hikes that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174 — from immediate expensing of R&D to mandatory amortization, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods — was that kind of provision. It didn’t start affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative scoring. The delay wasn’t a technical necessity. It was a political tactic. Such moves are common in tax legislation. Phase-ins and delayed provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) — Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits — scores legislation, pushing costs or revenue losses outside official forecasting windows. And so, on schedule in 2022, the change to Section 174 went into effect. Companies filed their 2022 tax returns under the new rules in early 2023. And suddenly, R&D wasn’t a full, immediate write-off anymore. The tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product and project managers, data scientists, and even some user experience and marketing staff — all of which had previously reduced taxable income in year one — now had to be spread out over five- or 15-year periods. To understand the impact, imagine a personal tax code change that allowed you to deduct 100% of your biggest source of expenses, and that becoming a 20% deduction. For cash-strapped companies, especially those not yet profitable, the result was a painful tax bill just as venture funding dried up and interest rates soared. It’s no coincidence that Meta announced its “Year of Efficiency” immediately after the Section 174 change took effect. Ditto Microsoft laying off 10,000 employees in January 2023 despite strong earnings, or Google parent Alphabet cutting 12,000 jobs around the same time. Amazon (AMZN) also laid off almost 30,000 people, with cuts focused not just on logistics but on Alexa and internal cloud tools — precisely the kinds of projects that would have once qualified as immediately deductible R&D. Salesforce (CRM) eliminated 10% of its staff, or 8,000 people, including entire product teams. In public, companies blamed bloat and AI. But inside boardrooms, spreadsheets were telling a quieter story. And MD&A notes — management’s notes on the numbers — buried deep in 10-K filings recorded the change, too. R&D had become more expensive to carry. Headcount, the leading R&D expense across the tech industry, was the easiest thing to cut. In its 2023 annual report, Meta described salaries as its single biggest R&D expense. Between the first and second years that the Section 174 change began affecting tax returns, Meta cut its total workforce by almost 25%. Over the same period, Microsoft reduced its global headcount by about 7%, with cuts concentrated in product-facing, engineering-heavy roles. Smaller companies without the fortress-like balance sheets of Big Tech have arguably been hit even harder. Twilio (TWLO) slashed 22% of its workforce in 2023 alone. Shopify (SHOP) (headquartered in Canada but with much of its R&D teams in the U.S.) cut almost 30% of staff in 2022 and 2023. Coinbase (COIN) reduced headcount by 36% across a pair of brutal restructuring waves. Since going into effect, the provision has hit at the very heart of America’s economic growth engine: the tech sector. By market cap, tech giants dominate the S&P 500, with the “Magnificent 7” alone accounting for more than a third of the index’s total value. Workforce numbers tell a similar story, with tech employing millions of Americans directly and supporting the employment of tens of millions more. As measured by GDP, capital-T tech contributes about 10% of national output. It’s not just that tech layoffs were large, it’s that they were massively disproportionate. Across the broader U.S. economy, job cuts hovered around in low single digits across most sectors. But in tech, entire divisions vanished, with a whopping 60% jump in layoffs between 2022 and 2023. Some cuts reflected real inefficiencies — a response to over-hiring during the zero-interest rate boom. At the same time, many of the roles eliminated were in R&D, product, and engineering, precisely the kind of functions that had once benefitted from generous tax treatment under Section 174. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms — basically every company you recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads — built their growth models around a kind of engineered break-even. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what’s known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. But the Section 174 change broke that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, the tax shield vanished. Companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first growth collapsed overnight. So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave like tech companies. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside the capital-T tech sector. This lines up with OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies ran with that logic. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Add that to core tech’s contribution, and the Section 174 shift has likely touched at least 20% of the U.S. economy. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue effectively hid a time bomb inside the growth engines of thousands of companies. And when it detonated, it kneecapped the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America look irrational on a spreadsheet. A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to repeal the Section 174 change, with business groups, CFOs, crypto executives, and venture capitalists lobbying hard for retroactive relief. But the politics are messy. Fixing 174 would mean handing a tax break to the same companies many voters in both parties see as symbols of corporate excess. Any repeal would also come too late for the hundreds of thousands of workers already laid off. And of course, the losses don’t stop at Meta’s or Google’s campus gates. They ripple out. When high-paid tech workers disappear, so do the lunch orders. The house tours. The contract gigs. The spending habits that sustain entire urban economies and thousands of other jobs. Sandwich artists. Rideshare drivers. Realtors. Personal trainers. House cleaners. In tech-heavy cities, the fallout runs deep — and it’s still unfolding. Washington is now poised to pass a second Trump tax bill — one packed with more obscure provisions, more delayed impacts, more quiet redistribution. And it comes as analysts are only just beginning to understand the real-world effects of the last round. The Section 174 change “significantly increased the tax burden on companies investing in innovation, potentially stifling economic growth and reducing the United States’ competitiveness on the global stage,” according to the tax consulting firm KBKG. Whether the U.S. will reverse course — or simply adapt to a new normal — remains to be seen. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Steve Jones, 2025-06-04 I've been reading an interesting book that looks at some of the ways that we can better build software in enterprises. One of the side notes in the book is that the tech companies have the funding and the ability to disrupt many other types of businesses, not just technology. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have delved into other types of industries, potentially pushing others out. We see Amazon becoming as much a shipping and logistics company as they are a retailer. There was a unionization vote, which passed in 2022. Recently, another one failed. Amazon continues to fight these efforts, trying to prevent workers from collectively negotiating the terms of their employment. I've wondered in the past if tech workers would ever unionize. In general, we are paid well and have lots of options for work. There has often been no shortage of opportunities for talented workers, though this year is proving tough for our industry. There are lots of people out of work and struggling to find new jobs. While I'm sure some would prefer a union that might better protect them from layoffs, many tech workers are against the idea. There is a growing number of tech workers looking to unionize. Inside Google, there is a union for some workers, but not all. That's unusual, as often all workers in a category are part of a union at a company. To gain employment, you need to join the union. I don't know if I'd want to join a union. I've had lots of success and haven't seen the need, but I do know that I've also seen lots of other tech workers pressured and pushed to work long hours, to skip vacations, and other practices that are good for the employer, but not so good for the employee. I've seen many people not know how to negotiate with employers, and perhaps a union would benefit most people. Would you want to be part of a data professionals' union? It might give some security and more benefits for many, though not quite as much pay as you might otherwise receive. Maybe more than you get now, as it depends on where you sit in the salary scale at your company. Let me know what you think about unions today.
