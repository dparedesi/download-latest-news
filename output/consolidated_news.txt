Nvidia made history by becoming the world’s first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization. The milestone was reached as Nvidia’s stock price surged to $164.42 during intraday trading on July 9. The company’s stock has soared by approximately 1,460% over the past five years, with a near 18% gain registered year-to-date. Nvidia’s ascent is driven by its near-monopoly on AI chip manufacturing, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) forming the backbone of machine learning, data centers, and large language models. The Silicon Valley giant’s chips are now essential for tech giants including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet. Nvidia’s historic rally has had a dramatic impact on the personal fortune of its co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. As of July 2025, Huang’s net worth is estimated by Bloomberg at $140 billion, up $25 billion this year alone. Huang owns about 3.5% of Nvidia, making him the largest individual shareholder. This surge places Huang among the world’s 10 richest individuals, with his fortune closely tracking Nvidia’s stock performance. Nvidia now holds the heaviest weighting on the S&P 500 index, surpassing tech giants Apple and Microsoft. The milestone has fueled optimism for further growth, with some analysts projecting Nvidia’s market cap to keep rising. Loop Capital’s Ananda Baruah sees Nvidia at the “front-end” of the next “Golden Wave” for generative AI pushing it past $6 trillion in coming years.

Title: Microsoft Isn't in the '$4 Trillion Club'—Yet

Microsoft won't be the first company to see its market cap touch $4 trillion—but its shares still have plenty of room to rise, one analyst said. Oppenheimer cited growth in Microsoft's (MSFT) AI revenue among its reasons on Wednesday to upgrade the software giant's shares to a bullish "outperform" rating. It set a $600 price target that is well above Visible Alpha's average of just over $548 and one of a few that is $5 below the highest one out there. The target represents about a 20% premium to Tuesday's close; the shares were recently up nearly 1% to nearly $501, perhaps on track for their first close above $500 apiece. (You can read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) The company's market cap is around $3.7 trillion today, according to Visible Alpha data. Growing AI revenue offers "not only valuation support ... but also upside potential as this revenue stream continues scaling fast and investors embrace Microsoft as one of the long-term AI winners in software," Oppenheimer wrote. The analysts also said Microsoft was one of "only a few vendors in the software industry" capable of a so-called "Rule of 60" profile, a reference to the concept of a company having a combined annual revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin above 60. That, they said, "lends good support to premium multiples" for Microsoft's stock. Microsoft is one of only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion. Nvidia (NVDA) this morning became the first to top $4 trillion; Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note earlier today said he figures Microsoft will get there "this summer." Apple (AAPL) has a market cap of about $3.1 trillion.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were up. Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company ever to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization as demand for its artificial intelligence chips keeps growing. AES (AES) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 on a report the renewable energy provider is exploring a possible sale.

Title: France not fit to replace BlackRock in Ukraine – party leader to RT

Time Published: 2025-07-09T16:01:36Z
Full Content:
The reported plans by the French government to replace US investment holding BlackRock in Ukraine are “unacceptable” for the EU nation’s people, the leader of France’s Patriots party, Florian Philippot, told RT in an exclusive interview on Tuesday. BlackRock had been actively involved in developing a multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund aimed at financing post-war reconstruction projects, with plans to attract $15 billion from public and private investors, including commitments from Germany, Italy, and Poland. The fund, which was set to be unveiled at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 10-11, is now on hold, and France is reportedly working on an alternative plan. Last week, Bloomberg claimed, citing informed sources, that BlackRock halted the search for investors for its fund earlier this year due to US President Donald Trump’s rocky relations with the authorities in Kiev. The sources also claimed that France has been trying to set up an alternative structure that could take the spot freed by the US company in the country. However, they questioned if the reported French initiative could succeed without the American money. Philippot told RT that the report by Bloomberg came as a “complete surprise” for him. He reminded that France is €3.4 trillion (around $4 trillion) in debt and is about to face “extreme austerity,” blaming the situation on the policies of President Emmanuel Macron. ”We are no longer properly funding hospitals, farmers, security and many other expenditure items. How are we going to replace a behemoth like BlackRock in Ukraine under conditions of total military, diplomatic, financial and economic uncertainty?” the politician wondered. The general public will be against the alleged plans by the government in Paris once more people learn about them, Philippot insisted. “This is obviously unacceptable for the French,” he added. The Patriots party leader said that Macron’s moves regarding Kiev “make no sense,” urging France’s immediate and “total military and financial disengagement from Ukraine.” He also suggested that BlackRock withdrew from Ukraine because it realized that it is inevitably going to suffer a defeat at the hands of Russia. “You do not invest in a country that is going to lose,” Philippot explained. BlackRock, which controls roughly $11.6 trillion in assets, owns substantial shares in military-industrial giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, among many others. Armaments produced by these firms, which are supplied to Kiev by its Western backers, have seen extensive use in the conflict. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation in Q3 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 90% of liver transplants. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com. Important Safety Information: For important safety information regarding the alfapump® system, see https://www.sequanamedical.com/wp-content/uploads/ISI.pdf.

Title: Kraken expands xStocks to BNB Chain enabling global access to tokenized equities

The expansion opens doors for global investors to trade tokenized US equities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Kraken has announced the expansion of its xStocks product to Binance-backed BNB Chain, marking a significant step toward making tokenized US equities more accessible globally. According to a July 9 statement, Kraken’s users outside the United States will soon be able to deposit and withdraw tokenized stocks, such as AAPLx, TSLAx, SPYx, and NVDAx, via BNB Chain. These assets, issued by Backed, will be deployed as BEP-20 tokens, providing seamless integration with DeFi platforms like PancakeSwap. Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s co-CEO, said the expansion is part of the firm’s goal of building a “chain-neutral” and “always-on” capital market. He described tokenized equities as “programmable settlement primitives” that allow instant global transfers and atomic settlement. They also enable composability with on-chain financial products like derivatives and lending protocols. According to him: “In a world that will inevitably be multichain, it is critical that assets like equities can move fluidly across ecosystems, protocols, and liquidity layers without being gated by jurisdiction or legacy custodial rails.” Kraken’s move is part of a broader industry trend. Over the past months, several crypto-native platforms like Robinhood and Wall Street giants such as BlackRock have increasingly focused on tokenization. According to the Security Token Market, this trend is a result of a growing demand for tokenized assets, which are projected to soar to $30 trillion by 2030. Considering this, Galaxy Digital pointed out that the rapid growth of tokenization presents significant opportunities and challenges. The firm stated that the round-the-clock trading model gives users constant market access. However, it also exposes them to increased volatility during off-hours. Galaxy Digital warned that this shift could be more disruptive for traditional financial institutions. Traditional exchanges like the NYSE may face increased pressure as more brokerages move toward blockchain-based settlement and trading. Their dominance, built on centralized liquidity and structured hours, risks being eroded by platforms offering real-time trading and decentralized asset ownership. As a result, legacy exchanges must adapt or risk losing market activity. They also face the threat of losing core revenue sources, such as trading fees and data sales, to the newly emerging platforms. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Despite export restrictions and challenges from Chinese rivals, Nvidia has rallied 74% since April. CEO Jensen Huang sees global AI expansion just beginning.

Title: Why Coca-Cola’s CIO prioritizes big-impact AI pilot projects
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/09/why-coca-colas-cio-prioritizes-big-impact-ai-pilot-projects/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T15:15:32Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Neeraj Tolmare, the chief information officer at Coca-Cola, says the artificial intelligence pilots that he invests in only get authorized if the beverage giant can envision revenue generation or big efficiency gains once fully in production. This strategy reflects a mandate from Coke’s CEO James Quincey and the broader leadership team that demands that AI experimentation “has to be tied to a real outcome that moves the needle for us,” says Tolmare. “We are all about scale.” That scale is massive for Coca-Cola, which is ranked 97th on the Fortune 500. Each AI bet by Tolmare has to weigh cost of implementation, as well as how the technology may be used internally across various functions ranging from software development to sales. On top of that, he must weigh how new technology advancements like agentic AI will change workflows and how data is shared within Coke and close key external partners, including the 200 bottlers and 950 production facilities that make up the entire system that Coke relies on to serve 2.2 billion beverages each day. One pilot that Tolmare is particularly excited about is the development of an algorithm that Coke developed to help retail outlets better predict demand, using AI to ensure that their shelves are always appropriately stocked. In the past, sales agents would visit stores every few weeks and at times, find themselves facing half-empty coolers. Coke had to rely on historical retail scan data to try to anticipate future demand. But with AI, the company was able to create an algorithm that triangulates historical data with weather patterns, which is an important consideration for beverage purchases, and geolocation data from Google to more precisely predict future sales. Those AI insights inform the messages Coca-Cola sends via WhatsApp to managers, advising them on when to stock more Sprite or Diet Coke before they run out. The pilot was tested in three countries and saw sales increase by 7% to 8% versus outlets that weren’t using the AI algorithm, according to Tolmare, who intends to broaden the application of this AI tool to more markets globally. Another investment with big reach is Coke’s usage of AI for content creation. The beverage giant sells in more than 180 countries and creates marketing assets in over 130 languages. It’s a process that’s both time consuming and costly, because Coke has to adjust the materials to reflect not only language, but also cultural sensibilities. Coke recently created 20 AI-generated assets, all based on the company’s own proprietary intellectual property, and then created 10,000 variations to be used across many different languages and geographies. Tolmare asserts that consumers are 20% more likely to engage with this content than prior iterations that weren’t crafted by AI, and that the AI-produced content was three times faster to generate. In both cases, he stresses the importance of keeping humans in the loop. “AI has proven that it can unlock value that a human being would not be able to unlock because the computation needed to mine through all this data and bring something meaningful is so complex,” says Tolmare, in regards to the algorithm to support retail sales. With marketing, AI’s application is a bit trickier and Coke is still figuring out the right approach. An AI-generated Christmas spot generated some backlash last year and in April, a different campaign made a mistake featuring a quote from a book that novelist J.G. Ballard never wrote. Tolmare says Coke has strict guidelines in place to ensure that AI-generated content avoids social biases that would be harmful to consumers and is keenly aware of hallucinations or deepfakes that can occur when generating creative content with AI tools. “That’s not to say that we won’t ever fall into it,” admits Tolmare. “But we have a mechanism in place that allows us to react in a responsible way if and when that happens.” Most of Tolmare’s career has been in the technology industry, including working for gadget manufacturer Palm, which ultimately lost out on an effort to compete with Apple in the smartphone market. He also previously served as a director at networking-equipment company Cisco Systems and as a VP at HP during the years in which it split up the personal-computer and printer businesses from the corporate hardware and services arm. “I’ve spent more than two decades working for companies that develop and manufacture technology that the rest of the world uses,” says Tolmare. He joined Coca-Cola in 2018 to work at a company that consumes technology, rather than developing it, to grow their business. Tolmare spearheaded the company’s all-in bet on cloud computing, retiring or selling all of Coke’s physical data centers. Roughly 80% of the company’s footprint is in Microsoft Azure with the rest split between Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. “We continuously monitor which one is going to give us better efficiency by moving a workload from one cloud to another,” says Tolmare. His hybrid cloud playbook is also applicable to how Coke thinks about generative AI experimentation. Coke works closely with Microsoft and its strategic partner OpenAI, but also taps other AI hyperscalers including Google, Meta, and Anthropic. “We don’t want to paint ourselves into a corner too soon,” he says. “The market itself is not consolidating.” What’s next on deck is further exploration with agentic AI, systems that are designed to perform tasks autonomously or with little human intervention. The company is considering offerings from vendors including Microsoft, SAP, and Adobe, while developing its own AI agents trained on Coke’s data. All of these AI agents remain in the pilot phase, because Tolmare still wants to determine if these systems can be built at a cost effective price, while achieving the optimal business outcomes. “We haven’t launched agentic in production yet, but we are very close,” says Tolmare. “I’m fascinated by what this can do for our business.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech giants offer more discounts to the federal government. The Wall Street Journal reports that Oracle is cutting the cost of the company’s database software and cloud-computing service for the federal government. The discount on cloud infrastructure is the first of its kind for the entire government and could be replicated with other cloud providers in negotiations that are currently underway. Other recent price discounts that the General Services Administration were able to extract from vendors include a deal cut with Salesforce to trim the price of messaging app Slack by 90% through the end of November and lower costs from Google and Adobe. The GSA has opted to negotiate these savings through direct engagement with the tech giants, rather than discussing pricing with third parties. “Through procurement consolidation, we’re aiming to bring the leverage of the whole, commanding purchasing power of the federal wallet to these [technology providers] to get the best discounts for the taxpayers,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum told WSJ. Ford CEO predicts AI will replace half of U.S. white-collar workers. CEOs have increasingly shared their dour prognostication of AI’s impact on the future of work and the latest diagnosis came from Jim Farley, the CEO of automaker Ford. Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley was making the case that the education system is too focused on pushing students toward a four-year college degree, which may be counterintuitive, given his view that “AI is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Farley makes a pitch for more investment in trade workers, those who may take a job on an auto factory floor or in construction, where there is a shortage of workers. He may have a point, as tech giants continue to slice jobs, with Microsoft earlier this month cutting another 9,000 jobs, bringing the grand total of jobs eliminated by the tech giant to 15,000 this year. But, IT unemployment dropped to its lowest level this year in June. Much of the consternation about AI's impact on work has been focused on tech jobs, especially as big employers like Microsoft and TikTok continue to generate national headlines when announcing layoffs. That said, across all sectors, businesses are on the hunt for talent and have been hiring for software developers and engineers, systems engineers and architects, and cybersecurity professionals, according to CIO Dive, which reported on insights from CompTIA. The IT trade organization reported that IT unemployment fell to 2.8% in June, as companies across all sectors added 90,000 net new tech jobs. Active employer job listings for tech positions reached 455,341 in June, with 47% of that total newly added in June. But the tech industry itself continues to be a weak point, as that sector reduced staffing by a net 7,256 positions in June. Google parent company’s AI-powered drug firm gearing up for clinical trials. Alphabet’s drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is getting close to testing AI-designed drugs in humans, Fortune reports, as company president Colin Murdoch says “the next big milestone is actually going to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings. We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close.” Isomorphic Labs, which was spun out of Google’s AI research lab DeepMind in 2021, raised $600 million in April to help propel its goal of combining the expertise of machine learning researchers and pharma veterans to design new treatments at a faster pace, more cheaply, and with a higher rate of success. Isomorphic supports existing pharma drug discovery programs, having already inked research collaborations with Novartis and Eli Lilly, and also develops its own internal drug candidates in areas such as oncology and immunology. Why CIOs need to focus on both data quality and permission. A new survey found that while 52% of companies are “highly reliant” on the consented data that’s used to craft personalized marketing materials and product development, there are still roadblocks as it pertains to how enterprises use this data. That’s important to get right if enterprises want to retain trust with the consumers that authorize the use of their data, while also adhering to state laws in places like California, which has given individuals greater control over their personal information. Some big issues that CIOs face related to consent requirements include a lack of visibility into data flows (61%), followed closely by difficulty tracking user preferences across channels (59%). They’ll need to solve these problems quickly as 100% of the 265 survey respondents say that consented consumer data is foundational to their ability to succeed when it comes to pursuing AI initiatives. Kate Parker, President of Transcend, the data privacy management software provider that funded the study, tells Fortune that the findings highlight a shift in thinking that’s less focused on data quality and more about permission to use the consumer data in the first place. “If CIOs and digital leaders are in agreement that the consent of the data is the fundamental component of AI and personalization, but they also admit very openly that they do not have the infrastructure to solve that in scale, that’s going to be one of the biggest growth blockers,” says Parker.

Title: Nvidia Rides the AI Wave to Become the World’s First $4 Trillion Company

Full Content:
When the stock markets opened this morning, Nvidia (NVDA) became the world’s first publicly traded company to reach a market value of $4 trillion, surpassing tech industry giants Apple and Microsoft in reaching the record-setting benchmark. While Nvidia’s market cap has since dipped to $3.99 trillion as of writing, it is nonetheless an incredible achievement to be the first company to cross the $4 trillion mark. Nvidia’s extraordinary financial success is due in significant part to the company’s commitment to making chips for the AI arms race, a move that helped it reach a $2 trillion valuation — the highest-ever at the time for a chipmaker — not even a year and a half ago. In the past five years, Nvidia’s stock price has gone from less than $11 per share to over $163 today. Save for a sizable tumble in April this year, which the company has obviously since recovered from, it has been nearly exclusively good news for the American multinational corporation during the AI era. Nvidia’s revenue eclipsed $130.5 billion in fiscal year 2025, a 114% increase year-over-year, and way above the company’s $26.97 billion revenue in 2023. Nvidia’s rise has been meteoric. Meanwhile, Microsoft, which boasts an impressive $3.75 trillion market cap, has experienced tremendous growth of its own over the past five years. Microsoft’s stock price has risen 290 points, or 136%, in five years. In contrast to many of its peers, Microsoft has also had an excellent 2025 so far, with stock prices rising 20.5% since January 1. However, Microsoft recently laid off about 15,000 employees as part of its AI-focused restructuring in the past two months, so while investors may be loving Microsoft, all is not well at the Redmond-based company. Another company that was a strong contender to hit the $4 trillion market cap mark first, Apple, has experienced a very different 2025 than Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple’s stock price has dropped 35 points (14.3%) so far this year and is about 50 points off its peak from last December. On December 27, 2024, Apple came close to $4 trillion — hitting $3.86 trillion. From hitting $1 trillion market cap in May 2023 to topping $4 trillion, if only briefly, on July 9, 2025, Nvidia has benefited from the AI hype more than any other company on Earth. “This is a historical moment for Nvidia, the tech space flexing its muscles, and speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of growth led by the one chip fueling AI… Nvidia,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNN over email today. Ives also told CNN that he expects Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion mark sometime this summer. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, believes the company is still in the early stages of AI’s financial and technological potential. He said on an earnings call in May that every country and industry on Earth will need AI. Huang may be right, as the financial markets love AI, even if society at large doesn’t.

And the most valuable company ever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia on Wednesday became the world's first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company ever. The company's stock price is driven by the AI frenzy as well as its unique position in the AI ecosystem as the key supplier of hardware and software stack for training and inference. By reaching the $4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia not only left behind such tech giants as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft, but also the vast majority of semiconductor companies. Only Broadcom ($1.298 trillion) and TSMC ($1.2 trillion) are in the Top 10 of the world's most valuable companies and are among the three semiconductor firms to reach a trillion-dollar capitalization mark. Other semiconductor companies, such as ASML ($313.22 billion), AMD ($226.76 billion), Texas Instruments ($197.61 billion), Arm Holdings ($161.3 billion), and Qualcomm ($175.67 billion) are far from touching a $1 trillion market capitalization. Intel, once an investors' darling, is now valued at $101.26 billion. Such a huge difference between the market capitalization of Nvidia and its industry peers underscores the unique position that Nvidia holds in today's high-tech ecosystem. The company supplies AI GPUs to virtually all of the AI leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, and xAI, just to name a few. So far, only Microsoft Azure has warned that it would slow down the expansion of its data centers. Other companies are well on track to expand their AI clusters to hundreds of thousands or even millions of Nvidia GPUs in the coming years, so the sky is blue for Nvidia. Observers believe that investors' optimism about Nvidia stems from three factors. Firstly, they expect the AI sector to continue growing in the coming years, which will ensure growing sales of AI hardware. Secondly, Nvidia is expected to sustain its leading position on the market as so far, no company has unveiled hardware that can match the performance and scalability of Nvidia's GPUs for AI training and inference. Thirdly, investors now expect the U.S. to reach trade deals with the most important partners, which will ensure the company's ability to supply its products to growing markets, including the Middle East and Europe, which will offset the company's current inability to supply high-performance AI GPUs to China.

Title: Ambani's Reliance Jio delays India IPO beyond this year: Report
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ambanis-reliance-jio-delays-india-ipo-beyond-this-year-report-11752071301806.html

NEW DELHI/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Indian telecoms and digital giant Reliance Jio Platforms, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has decided not to launch its planned IPO this year, delaying one of the country's most anticipated stock offerings, two people familiar with the matter said. Valued by analysts at more than $100 billion, Jio wants to achieve higher revenue and a bigger subscriber base for its telecoms business while expanding its other digital offerings to boost its valuation before an initial public offering, one of the sources said. Shares of parent conglomerate Reliance Industries fell sharply in Mumbai after the Reuters report, losing as much as 1.8%, or $6 billion in market value. Reliance closed 1.2% down, with its significant weighting in other indexes dragging the broader Indian market into negative territory. Nearly 80% of Jio Platforms' latest annual revenue of $17.6 billion came from its telecoms business -- Reliance Jio Infocomm, India's biggest player. But Ambani is also accelerating expansion of his other niche digital businesses focused on developing apps, connected devices and AI business solutions. Reliance Jio is also set to lock horns with Elon Musk, who is expected to launch the Starlink internet service in India in the coming months. Jio, which counts Google and Meta among investors, has also partnered Nvidia to develop AI infrastructure. Ambani said in 2019 that Jio and Reliance Retail will move towards listings within five years. And last year Reuters reported that Reliance was targeting a 2025 Mumbai listing for Jio Platforms, aiming for it to be India's biggest IPO. "Jio (IPO) is not going to happen this year, it's just not possible. The company wants the business to be more mature," the first source said. Both the sources, who declined to be identified because the strategy is confidential, said Reliance had yet to appoint bankers to discuss a potential stock market offering. Reliance did not respond to Reuters queries on the matter. Jio Infocomm has faced some churn in its subscriber base after price increases but has returned to growth this year and has more than 488 million subscribers. Indian brokerage IIFL Capital said in April that it was cutting its 2025-26 core profit estimate for Jio by 3%, citing higher costs and the expected increase in prices, probably in late 2025. It also cut its valuation estimate from $117 billion to $111 billion, though Jefferies values the business at $136 billion. The first source declined to share the valuation that Jio had been targeting for the proposed IPO but said it was "easily above $100 billion". India's IPO market had its best year in 2024, with $20.5 billion raised, second only to the United States. Trade wars and Middle East tension have turned market sentiment jittery, but it is recovering. India is the world's second-biggest IPO market with $5.86 billion raised by June this year, accounting for the 12% of total proceeds globally, LSEG data shows. Reuters has previously reported that the Reliance Retail IPO was being delayed for the company to address operational challenges at the company that runs India's biggest grocery store network of 3,000 supermarkets. The Reliance Retail IPO is unlikely before 2027 or 2028, the first source added without elaborating. Reliance Retail and Jio have powered the parent's earnings in the six months to March while its energy segment has been hit by lower margins and weaker demand. Ambani, Asia's richest man, has raised $25 billion collectively for digital, telecoms and retail businesses from the likes of KKR, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, General Atlantic and Silver Lake in recent years. "The investors are not upset (about IPO delays). They know the money is sitting in front of them," the first source said.

Title: NVIDIA’s AI Chips Are “The New Gold And Oil,” Says Investment Bank As Firm Briefly Crosses $4 Trillion Market Value

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. AI GPU designer NVIDIA Corporation made history today by becoming the first company in history to cross a $4 trillion market capitalization before slightly dipping below it. NVIDIA's achievement follows a surge in its shares in June after a massive crash in January that saw the firm bleed $600 billion in market capitalization after investors fed the shares, worrying that China's DeepSeek had demonstrated cost-effective GPU use that could cull the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs. June was a strong month for NVIDIA's shares as they benefited from bullish analyst estimates for medium-term AI demand. NVIDIA continues to enjoy a dominant role in the AI ecosystem courtesy of its GPUs, which lead the market in terms of performance and are among the most highly sought products in the world. The criticality of NVIIDA's GPUs was evident in a fresh note from Wedbush, which came just as the firm crossed the $4 trillion market capitalization milestone. Calling NVIDIA's AI chips "the new gold and oil," the investment bank posits that $4 trillion is just the start and investor attention will focus on $5 trillion over the next 18 months. Wedbush adds that NVIDIA might not be the only $4 trillion company, as it might be joined by software giant Microsoft. NVIDIA's shares have stayed resilient despite US sanctions on China, which have hurt the firm's revenue. The robust performance is partly due to CEO Jensen Huang pivoting to sovereign AI after the Chinese restrictions to assure investors that NVIDIA can sell its chips to other countries as well. Like NVIDIA, Microsoft's shares were also laggards at the year's start. The stock had struggled since mid-2024 after investors were left wondering whether the software company could adequately monetize its AI cloud computing offerings. However, Microsoft's latest earnings report shifted the narrative, as 33% Azure growth during its fiscal third quarter ended up allaying investor concerns. "We believe Microsoft will also hit the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5 trillion club," said Wedbush as it believes that the AI-led stock market growth is still in its nascent stages. Going all-in on AI, the investment bank shares that "it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years" and adds "that for every $1 spent on Nvidia, there is an $8-$10 multiplier across the rest of the tech ecosystem." While Wedbush's note focuses primarily on enterprise AI, the bank briefly mentions that Alphabet, Amazon and Meta are its favorite players in consumer AI. Notably missing is Apple, whose 13% year-to-date share price drop is partly due to investor belief that the firm has fallen behind big tech when it comes to AI. The bank concludes its note by sharing that it is seeing "many IT departments focused on foundational hyper scale deployments for AI around Microsoft, Amazon, and Google with a laser focused on the software driven use cases currently underway as high priority AI use cases have been identified and now being driven/accelerated across a myriad of verticals."

Title: An isotopic perspective on equid selection in cult at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath, Israel

Archaeological excavations of an Early Bronze Age III (c. 2900–2600/2550 BCE) domestic neighborhood at the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath, Israel, uncovered four complete skeletons of young female donkeys that were buried immediately below house floors as ritual foundation deposits. Multi-isotope analyses (carbon, oxygen and strontium) of their teeth document that each of the donkeys was born and raised in Egypt before being brought to Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath where they were slaughtered and buried beneath house floors in a non-elite domestic neighborhood. In contrast, isotopic analysis of teeth from a single isolated donkey mandible and additional sheep and goat teeth that displayed evidence of being used for food consumption and not associated with a complete burial, identify the donkey as born and raised among local livestock in the vicinity of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. The intentionally buried of specifically imported and highly valued young jennies reveal what appears to be a ritually charged characteristic when constructing domestic residences at the site.

Archaeological excavations in an Early Bronze Age III (c. 2900–2600/2550 BCE) domestic neighborhood at the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath uncovered four complete young female donkey skeletons (EQ1-EQ4) buried immediately below house floors. The first excavated donkey (EQ1 – also known as a sacrificial ass) is a clear sacrificial foundation deposit [1]. Isotopic analyses indicated that it was born and raised in Egypt before being brought to the site where it was slaughtered [2]. The isotopic study has been completed on the three additional complete donkey burials excavated at the site in 2016 (EQ2 and EQ3) and 2017 (EQ4). For comparative purposes, isotopic analyses were also conducted on a loose equid mandible that was recovered in 2017 (EQ21), as well as on livestock (sheep and goat) specimens from the same deposits at the site. In addition, bioavailable strontium from the surroundings of the site were also analyzed. The results presented here confirm exchange connections between Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath and Old Kingdom Egypt as proposed by the isotopic data from EQ1. They further reveal a decision to sacrifice young and healthy female animals, those exclusively imported from Egypt. The archaeological site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath (modern Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi; ancient Gath) is in central Israel about 20 km from the Mediterranean coast on the southern bank of the Elah Valley. It is located on top of a natural limestone outcrop at the westernmost edge of the Judean Foothills (Shephelah in Hebrew) and overlooks the modern southern Coastal Plain of Israel [3] (Fig 1). This location allowed access to fresh water and exploitation of a rich variety and abundance of natural food resources from both the rolling foothills and coastal plain [4–7]. The site is positioned along or near several major transportation routes that transect the locality to regions to the north, south, east and west. These include the north-south “Trough Valley” along the base of the Judean Mountains to the east of the site; the north-south road along the coastal plain to the west of the site; and the east-west route that extends from the coast to the Judean highlands through the Elah Valley) [8,9]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g001 During the Early Bronze Age III (c. 2900–2600/2550 BCE), the site reaches urban proportions typical for this region (c. 24 ha in size) (Fig 2) and becomes one of the largest and most important of Early Bronze urban centers in the southern Levant [10–15]. It is surrounded by a thick and tall stone-based fortification system [16–24]. As a result of systematic surface collection and excavation, there is now evidence for an extensive Early Bronze (EB) occupation across the entire tell (or mound) [12,15]. Excavation areas are labeled by letters and Area E is in bold. Excavation areas are labeled by letters and Area E is in bold. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g002 Excavations conducted over the course of several seasons (2004–2017) at the eastern end of the site (Area E), uncovered part of an EB III urban residential (domestic) neighborhood [12,14]. The urban character of the site on whole during the EB III is seen through the extensive fortifications, evidence of social hierarchy and bureaucracy [25], and finds indicating economic connectivity [6,26–28] with broad regions in the Levant and beyond. In the excavation of Area E of the site, parts of several non-elite domestic residential buildings and an alleyway were intensively excavated and the remains studied (Fig 3). Three major strata of urban renewal occurred toward the end of the EB III period. In the earliest Stratum E5c (dated to the later EB III, c. 2700−2600 BCE), the buildings established in earlier strata (Strata E6-E7) are demolished and built anew. In the two subsequent strata (E5b and E5a), the buildings undergo further renovations where rooms are subdivided. After Stratum E5a, the site is abandoned/destroyed and there is no occupation in this area for more than a thousand years [29–31]. In the earliest E5c stratum, just before the walls were built, at least four donkeys were sacrificed and buried beneath the beaten earth floors of each building room. A thick (10−20 cm) layer of grey ashy soil accumulated above the floors during the occupation before the next strata of renewal occurred (E5b and a) [1,32–34]. Two radiocarbon contexts from Stratum E5c were measured from Building 134307, in which EQ1 was buried. The modeled 68.3% results range between 2870−2670 BCE for layer E5c, with three to four more likely ranges of years within those 200 years of probability distributions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g003 Four of the donkey specimens (EQ1–4) are from Stratum E5c and are completely articulated skeletons found buried beneath the earthen floor of the courtyards, at the layers of the floor infrastructure, in two large buildings on either side of the alleyway (Fig 3 and Fig 4a, b, c, d; Supplementary S1 Table). Each of the donkeys is buried in shallow pits about 20–30 cm beneath the floors in the time just before the floors were laid down as the neighborhood is being renewed. There is no evidence that they are later intrusions since they are sealed by the Stratum E5c dirt floor. All the burial pits were found without any other finds, only the equid skeletons. This contrasts with the rest of the infrastructure layers, where non-indicative pottery was found. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g004 One skeleton lies below the floor of Building 134307 (EQ1), while three lie below the floor of Building 17E82D08 across the alley (EQ2–4). In EQ1, the front and hind legs were tied together (trussed) below the abdomen, and the upper neck (cervical) vertebra and cranium were dismembered. It is evident that the animal was sacrificed as the head is fully cut off and carefully placed on the abdomen facing in the opposite direction [1]. The head rests on its left side. The three other complete skeletons are found across the alleyway buried beneath Courtyard 17E82D08 of Building 17E82D08. They also lie on their left sides, but without any clear evidence of dismemberment. Their legs also appear to have been trussed, as the feet are brought close together or overlap beneath their abdomens. While there are no artefacts associated with these interments, the deposits are ritual interments [1,9], with each of the skeletons carefully laid out in the same manner. Each is placed in a separate pit with the head facing east (possibly toward the rising sun) [33]. Further, all are either old subadults or young adults and healthy females who were killed in the prime of their lives. Fragments of donkey figurine and zoomorphic vessel carrying loads were also found in Stratum E5a. That the skulls of all four donkeys face eastwards, as well as their similar age and sex, suggests a cultic/ritual choice. Such an eastern orientation of skeletal remains is similar to preferences seen in Anatolia [35] and elsewhere in the southern Levant [36]. In contrast, EQ21 (Stratum E7) is the only incomplete skeleton discussed here (L20E93A12; B20E93A139). It is represented by an isolated mandible with teeth (LPM2–4 and M1-3, but M3 is only visible in the crypt). It was found in the collapse of a Stratum E7 building amidst a concentration of stones (L20E93A11) likely representing a floor in Stratum E7. It was selected for comparison with the four donkey burials as it was an example of an equid consumed, and its remains discarded afterwards. In addition, isotopic analysis for several sheep and goat specimens from the same horizons and bioavailable strontium specimens from surroundings of the site were also included to form a regional isoscape and baseline for comparison with the donkey remains. Each of these are discussed below to interpret the four donkeys ritually buried beneath the floors of buildings as the neighborhood is being renewed. Isotope signatures are incorporated into animal tissues and are stored for variable periods of time, depending on the turnover rate of the different tissues. As tooth enamel does not turnover once formed, [37] isotopic analysis provides a picture of the animal’s diet, seasonality and/or mobility at the time of formation. Hoppe et al. [38] utilized radiographic and optical analyses to determine the timing of tooth enamel biomineralization in horses. Their results indicate that the Molar 1 (M1) begins to mineralize around two weeks of age and continues to mineralize for approximately one year after eruption (occurring between 8 months and one year). As such, the first molar records isotopic signatures of diet and mobility up to approximately two years of age. The second molar (LM2) begins to mineralize before eruption at approximately six months of age, the tooth erupts between 20–26 months and will continue to mineralize for an additional 30 months. Mineralization of molar 3 (M3) starts when M1 and M2 erupt (~6–8 months), while M3 erupts between 3.5 and 4 years. The intra-tooth sampling of teeth utilized here will reveal information on shifts in diet (carbon), water (oxygen) and mobility (strontium) from birth to approximately five years of age. As each equid is aged through tooth eruption and wear and epiphyseal fusion at approximately five years of age1 this sampling strategy documents their entire lifespan. The use of stable carbon isotopes to reconstruct diet is well-established in archaeology. Terrestrial plants in the southern Levant can be divided into two groups (C3, C4) based on their differential means of fixing atmospheric CO2. These differential mechanisms result in distinct δ13C values. These differences in the δ13C values of the plants consumed are reflected in the tissues of the animals that consume them [39–41]. While C3 vegetation is dominant in Mediterranean climate zones [42], C4 grasses are also part of the flora of Mediterranean regions [43] and their abundance increases in steppe and desert environments [44]. Oxygen isotope composition in the tooth enamel in mammals is linked to the isotopic composition of environmental water they consume [45,46]. As the isotopic composition of the water is correlated with temperature and evapotranspiration, it will vary seasonally. In mid- to high- latitudes the lowest δ18O values are seen in the coldest months and the highest δ18O values during the summer months [47]. Strontium isotopes are useful as biogeochemical tracers in the study of mobility as they are characteristic of the local geology [48]. Strontium 87Sr/86Sr ratios vary locally with changes in local bedrock geology, bedrock weathering, and the contribution of atmospheric dust [49]. Soil and plants are in isotopic equilibrium with local soils and share similar isotopic ratios for bioavailable strontium. Animals consuming these plants incorporate strontium in the mineral structure of bones and teeth as calcium substitutes during tissue formation. Measurement of the strontium ratio will provide a measure of the relative importance of foods from areas of variable lithologies [50]. As a result, migration studies should utilize biologically available strontium rather than only substrate geology. Plants, soil, rodents and/or invertebrates may be collected for this purpose. Isotope results are presented in Fig 5 and 6 and in Supplementary S2 and S3 Tables. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g006 EQ2, EQ3, and EQ4 (n = 9 molars; 82 samples) have mean carbon isotope values of −2.7‰ and ranges from −7.5‰ to 0.7‰ (S2 Table, Fig 5) while EQ21 (n = 3 molars; 37 samples) has a = −10.5‰ and a range between −11.2‰ to −9.8‰ (Fig 6). These values suggest that EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 were eating vegetation from a mixed C3/C4 environment with a high proportion of C4 vegetation as was seen with EQ1 [2]. EQ21’s carbon values show a diet of >90% C3 from all molar samples, which indicates the dominance of C3 vegetation in the diet, matching the diet of previously sampled caprines (abbreviated OC for Ovis/Capra including both sheep and goat) [51]. EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 (n = 9 teeth, 81 samples) have average strontium ratios of 0.70824, and ranges of 0.70813 to 0.70833 (S3 Table, Fig 5). There are obvious similarities to the strontium ratios of the first and second molars of EQ1. EQ21 (n = 3 teeth; 40 samples) has an average of 0.70839, and ranges between 0.70836 to 0.70844 (Fig 6). The mean δ18O values for EQ2, EQ3, and EQ4 (n = 9 teeth; 82 samples) = 0.96‰ and values range between −1.6 -to 2.6‰ (S2 Table, Fig 5). Modern oxygen isotope values for the Nile River before the construction of Aswan Dam provide an average δ18O (VSMOW) of 0.74‰ and measured in shallow groundwater reservoirs [52]. These values align with the mean oxygen isotope values for Egyptian archaeological human tooth and bone carbonate values analyzed at different locations along the Nile valley (1.05 ± 1.02‰) [53]. The seasonal fluctuation in the δ18O values of sacrificial donkeys EQ2, EQ3, and EQ4, record short negative spikes (~−1‰ relative to adjacent samples and marked by green shaded areas in Fig 5). These correspond to summer season incorporation of Blue Nile water from the Ethiopian highland with measured [55]. Calculating the mean δ18O values of all the molar teeth of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 excluding the negative pulses highlights the significance of these shifts. The average of EQ2 molars minus the two negative samples at 6.4 mm and 34 mm (n = 30) is 0.8 ± 0.56‰ (1 std. dev.) vs. 0.95‰, the mean of the two negative pulses, a difference more than two standard deviations lower than the average. This pattern is repeated in EQ3 (n = 22; 1.2 + 0.8‰ vs. −0.5‰) and EQ4 (n = 22; 0.7 + 0.4‰ vs. −0.4‰). The oxygen isotope values for EQ21 are more negative = −2.3‰ than those of the donkeys (2 tail t-test assuming equal variance p > 0.00001) and range between −0.1 to −3.5‰ (Fig 6). EQ21 values agree with oxygen isotope values measured in caprines from Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [51] and correspond to mean modern δ18O values of rainfall of the southern Levant in proximity to the site between −3.5– (−5)‰ (VSMOW) [54]. The statistical procedure PROC DISTANCE in SAS was used to assess all of the isotope data (carbon, oxygen and strontium) currently available from Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath (EQ1 [2]; all caprines [51]) and the three additional equids (EQ2, EQ3, EQ4 and EQ21) discussed here. The DISTANCE procedure computes measures of dissimilarity or similarity between the observations. The output data set was then used as input to the MDS procedures. The MDS PROC performed multidimensional scaling to create Dimensions 1–4 (see Supplementary S4 Table). Dimensions 3 and 4 are all near zero and are redundant. As such, only Dimensions 1 and 2 are graphed (Fig 7). The unique pattern of OC#3 is highlighted. Arrows indicate the final three samples of the third molar of EQ1. The unique pattern of OC#3 is highlighted. Arrows indicate the final three samples of the third molar of EQ1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g007 Previous isotopic analyses of EQ1 utilized carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopic proxies as evidence that this individual was born and lived in the Nile Valley prior to travel and eventual sacrifice at the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [2]. EQ1 completed its early tooth development in the Nile Valley and later migrated to Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath where it completed the formation of its third molar. The three samples closest to the root/enamel junction (REJ) are the last to mineralize and reflect the shift in diet, water source and local geology (highlighted with arrows in Fig 7). This corroborates textual and other archaeological information that already pointed toward the existence of long-distance trade of donkey caravans between Egypt and Canaan during this early urban period. The analyses of four additional equids (from 3 burials and a single loose mandible) presented here provides additional direct evidence for the import of equids from Egypt to the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. While all four burials point to an Egyptian origin, the single loose mandible isotopic signature suggests a local origin from around the site. This is mirrored by the results of the other domestic livestock and bioavailable strontium analyses. While a single caprine was also identified as having an Egyptian origin, all the other caprines sampled (n = 16) reflect discrete values that indicate their life history was focused locally at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [2,51]. The primary indicator for Nile Valley origins of EQ1–4 is the dominance of C4 vegetation (>50%) in their diet, as indicated by the δ13C carbonate values measured in the early tooth formation of the EQ1 (M1 + M2) and in all three molar teeth of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 (Fig 5). As has been previously asserted [1] the Nile Valley is the nearest geographic location where C4 vegetation can serve as primary fodder for herbivores [55,56]. Seasonal shifts in carbon isotope values can be associated with agricultural cycles in the Nile Valley. C4 plants are not the sole forage or fodder source in Egypt but serve as a good food source for livestock. It is evident that on a seasonal basis donkeys might eat more C3 plants (by-products of agricultural production). The expected pattern of change in carbon isotopes for an animal moving from the Nile River Valley to the interior of the southern Levant would be a shift from a C4 plant dominant diet to a predominant C3 diet (Fig 8). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g008 This pattern is reflected in all equids showing a greater C3 contribution to the diet in their third molars. In contrast, the δ13C values of the sampled caprines predominantly reflect the C3 vegetation that dominates the Mediterranean climate with only a minor contribution of C4 vegetation [51]. EQ21’s carbon values show a diet of >90% C3 from all molar samples which indicates the dominance of C3 vegetation in the diet (Fig 6). EQ1 δ18O values match archaeological human tooth and bone carbonate values that were analyzed at different locations along the Nile valley (+1.05 ± 1.02‰)54 and the same is true for EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4. In addition, the oxygen isotopes of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 provide an important secondary marker for Egyptian origin with the observation of the Blue Nile negative oxygen isotope pulses along the teeth. Sequential sampling along first and second molars display a negative dip (~1‰) of oxygen isotope values at around 33−43 mm from the root-enamel-junction (REJ) that is congruent with seasonal flow of tributary water into the Nile River. These low points are associated with late summer flooding caused by the Blue Nile input. The flow of monsoon water from the highlands of Ethiopia into the Blue Nile occurs during late summer months and provides a pulse of 18O depleted water that dominate premodern Nile volume (85% of Nile flow) and composition [57,58]. The summer main rainy season mean oxygen isotope composition of the Blue Nile from the highlands of Ethiopia is −2.3‰ [57]. The intensity of Blue Nile water flow varies between years in agreement with ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) [59]. It is therefore unsurprising to see variability in the expression of Blue Nile signal within and between individuals. Further, a second negative dip in the oxygen isotope values is suggested by trends in the final samples of the teeth indicating a complete seasonal cycle. In contrast, the oxygen isotope values for EQ21 are more negative = −2.3‰ and match the δ18O values in caprine (OC) teeth studied at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [51]. Values vary between 0 – (−2) ‰ (n = 13, and are comparable to prehistoric gazelles originating in low topographies of the eastern Galilee and much higher than the negative values measured in high topography gazelles [60]. This pattern suggests that the EB caprine herds, and EQ21 were herded eastwards from the site to the lower reaches of the Judean Mountains. Even though the Judean Mountains elevation reaches ~1000 m above modern sea level, there is no indication that they were herded into the higher reaches of the Judean Mountains since their isotopic values are comparable to the gazelle’s low topographies values. Arnold et al. [2] detail plant collection strategy and results that allowed creation of a local isoscape surrounding the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. There is an 87Sr/86 Sr range of 0.7084–0.7085 for the rendzina soils that cover the area east of the site. This hilly region is very suitable for the herding of both grazers (sheep) and browsers (goats), while the flatter dark brown alluvium vertisol soils located west of the site that extend to the seashore are more suitable for rainfed cereal agriculture [61]. Plant sampling also took place on Holocene alluvium soils (vertisols) to the west of the site. However, this sampling cannot provide a credible estimate for all alluvial soils as alluvium strontium ratios vary depending on parent bedrock weathering and atmospheric deposition. Terra rossa (FAO: Cambisols and Phaeozems) soils develop on hard marine sedimentary bedrock (limestone and dolomite) primarily through atmospheric deposition [49,61]. This is evident from examination of plants growing on these soils since they incorporate bioavailable strontium with 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.7086 ± 0.0003. Moffat et al. [62] report two soil data points in the vicinity of the site that agree with 87Sr/86Sr ratios ranging from 0.70828–0.70870. In contrast, isoscapes are not as well developed in Egypt. A literature review of isotopic studies for the Nile Valley presents a median based on both animal and human data of 0.7076 ± 0.0003. However, the analyzed faunal samples show sizeable ranges and much wider ranges than the majority of the human samples. While the data from Tell el-Dab‘a (Hutwaret/Avaris) in the northeastern Nile Delta fits this range [63], it is problematically drawn from six archaeological bone samples. Strontium analysis from bone is problematic due to the greater impact of diagenesis on bone [64] as there is no accepted pretreatment that can fully deal with the issue of diagenesis in bone [65]. In addition, one of the Egyptian “baseline” animals is an equid, which is potentially a very mobile animal in the landscape as is argued here. Human burials from the Nile Valley yield tighter ratio ranges. For example, Memphis in Lower Egypt, =0.7078 ± 0.003; range 0.7074–0.7087 [66]. Although not exclusive to the Nile Valley, the strontium ratios do not contradict the other two independent lines of isotopic evidence – carbon and oxygen, that argue for Egyptian origins of EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4. The statistical analyses display two clusters. The first and second molars of EQ1 (while that individual lived in Egypt), EQ2, EQ3 and EQ4 all cluster on the right side of the graph (Fig 7). As does OC (Caprine) #3 – previously identified as having an Egyptian origin [2,51]. EQ21 and most caprines (apart from OC#3) all cluster on the left side of the graph. Also, on the left side of the graph, are the two samples closest to the REJ of EQ1’s M3 as these are the final samples to mineralize and thereby incorporate the isotopic signatures surrounding the site. From the pooled data of carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope values, we define a foreign cluster (EQ2, EQ3, EQ4, EQ1 first and second molars and OC#3) versus a local cluster at the site that includes EQ21, all other OC, the two final samples of EQ1’s third molar, one final sample of EQ2 and the two final samples of EQ4. All equids imported from Egypt are buried, fully articulated in household contexts and under habitation floors. Only equids receive this treatment and only equids from Egypt. One goat indicates Egyptian origins but was not intentionally buried [51]. Rather it was butchered, eaten and its remains discarded in a midden. One donkey (EQ21) does not have isotopic values that indicate its origin in Egypt, and it was also not intentionally buried. It was butchered and its remains were discarded. From our analysis, the donkeys imported from Egypt had greater social value than those raised and utilized locally. Cross-culturally, the selection of sacrificial animals is known to be based on criteria such as age, sex, species [67] and even coat color when preservation allows [68,69], but never seemingly selected based on geographic origin. From the perspective of the isotope studies, it is the Egyptian import status that is one of the key criteria for an animal to be selected for sacrifice. Being young and female are the other two variables. Thus, young female donkeys from Egypt are the ideal sacrificial animal at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath during the EB III. Perhaps, as noted elsewhere, they represented a distinct totem animal linked with the identity of inhabitants as merchants/traders [9]. These stand in contrast to a local equid (EQ21 – unable to determine sex) that was butchered and likely eaten. EQ21 derives from an earlier deposit at the site (Stratum E7) which slightly pre-dates the four completely articulated equid burials (probably less than 50 years). It is suggested that even within this preferred group, EQ1 is noteworthy. EQ1 was buried with the front and hind legs tied together (trussed) below the abdomen, and the upper neck (cervical) vertebra and cranium dismembered and placed on the abdomen facing east. It is evident the animal was sacrificed, the head entirely cut off and carefully placed on the abdomen facing in the opposite direction [1]. In contrast, the other equids were buried without trussed limbs and without decapitation. In addition, it appears that EQ1 alone was prepared for sacrifice as the isotopic data indicates her residence at the site for several months prior to sacrifice as is evident from the three final data points (on M3 closest to REJ) as has been previously argued [2]. These final strontium ratios are also more radiogenic than the other equids and local livestock. These ratios reflect agricultural areas on terra rosa soils like those found to the west of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath [51]. It can be deduced that even though EQ1 was grazed locally toward the end of her life, she was treated slightly differently from the other local equids. This imported donkey was kept penned and foddered with hay that was harvested in the valley, a product of dry farmed cereals. This donkey was never herded with other livestock east of the site. The archaeological, iconographic and textual evidence from the broader region surrounding the site of Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath highlights the centrality of equids in the culture and societies of the mid-3rd millennium BCE. Equids are known as work animals within the agricultural systems, used for plowing, threshing and as draft animals. In addition, equids played a significant role in trade, not only moving goods on their backs but also as valuable trade items themselves [33,70–72]. It is clear that some equids were elevated to the status of prestige animals as evidenced by their intentional sacrifice and burial at sites across the Levant, Syria and Mesopotamia. Notably, these burials occur in a variety of different contexts, both domestic [33] and elite [70,73,74], singularly and in pairs [75], both males and females and varying in age from nine months [75] to nine years [76]. This suggests regional preferences for specific types of equids for sacrifice, such as those from Egypt, as is proposed here. Further, the textual data also discusses selective breeding of equids and desired qualities of animals for particular purposes [73,75]. Our analysis has demonstrated that the non-local donkeys (young females in particular) were preferentially selected for sacrifice and burial beneath the floors of buildings as the neighborhood is being renewed in the Early Bronze III urban center at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath. The isotopic analysis suggests that imported Egyptian asses were preferentially selected as sacrificial animals, while locally raised equids were butchered and likely eaten. The data further highlights the charged ritual significance and value of select donkeys in this period of early complex state-level urban societies in the region. It was not any donkey that was deemed worthy of sacrifice at Tell eṣ-Ṣâfi/Gath, but only Egyptian young females. This suggests the function of these sacrifices is not simply a totem animal or an occupation marker but was socially and ritually charged by having come from Egypt. The importance and charged significance of the display of economic, and likely social and political connections with Egypt, was an integral part of the sacrificial ritual. Thus, an Egyptian donkey might have been seen as an exotic and special animal, worthy of specific ritual use. All necessary permits were obtained for the study described, which complied with all relevant regulations. Excavation permits were issued to Aren Maeir by the Israel Antiquities Authority (Permit #, G-56/2008, G-51/2010, G-66/2016, G-62/2017). Permits for export of material from Israel were issued to Aren Maeir by the Israel Antiquities Authority (Permit # 13840 – July 25, 2012). Additional information regarding the ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations specific to inclusivity in global research is included in the Supporting Information (Supplementary S1 Checklist) Two radiocarbon contexts (RTD 6830 and RTD 6844) from Stratum E5c were measured from Building 134307, in which donkey (EQ1) was buried. The samples were taken from an installation (E15AM09) (Fig 9). Sample RTD 6830 (Basket # TS12E15AM100) was taken within broken sherds of a holemouth cooking pot found inside a cooking installation built of stones. Seeds were measured in three separate targets to reach a higher precision for the context. For sample RTD 6844 (Basket # TS12E15AM083), seeds were taken from a thin white layer of phytoliths covering the cooking installation. Four separate targets were measured for a high precision date. For the sampling, pretreatment and measurement protocols [77–81] of the Dangoor Research Accelerator Spectroemter at the Weizmann Institute. The radiocarbon dates were calibrated using Oxcal v4.4.4 Bronk Ramsey (2021) software based on the calibration curve Reimer et al 2020 [81]. The measurements of each context were combined using the Rcombine function in the Oxcal v4.4.4 program, and both contexts passed the χ2 test. We built a small model using Oxcal v4.4.4 software [80,81] together with the samples from Stratum E5a [14], including a sequential boundary between the layers, since no samples from Stratum E5b were measured from this room. The agreement of the model is 61%. The modeled 68.3% results range between 2870−2670 BC for layer E5c, with three to four more likely ranges of years within those 200 years of probability distributions (Fig 10 and Table 2). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.t002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g009 The 68.3% probability distributions are plotted in darker color and marked by a line underneath the plots. The 68.3% probability distributions are plotted in darker color and marked by a line underneath the plots. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.g010 As each analyzed equid individual had an intact mandible, it was possible to sample all three molar teeth from each individual (Table 3). The total number of teeth per sample was determined by the size of the tooth. The third molar from EQ4 was sampled less due to breakage. Sequential sampling of teeth followed methods outlined by Bocherens et al. [82]. A series of 1.0 mm bands were drilled sequentially along the mesial lobe of each molar tooth. Dentin and cementum were removed from the equine teeth [83] prior to enamel sampling. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.t003 Pretreatment of the samples followed the methods of Balasse and colleagues [84–86]. The tooth enamel was treated with a 2.5% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) solution overnight to remove organics and then rinsed five times with distilled water and treated with 0.1M CH3COOH (acetic acid, pH3) for four hours to remove diagenetic carbonates. The samples were then rinsed five times with distilled water and freeze-dried. Even-numbered samples were analyzed for strontium isotope ratios and odd-numbered samples were analyzed for carbon and oxygen isotope compositions. Strontium isotope measurements were performed on a Nu Plasma HR multi-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Geology Department. Tooth enamel samples were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 3N nitric acid (HNO3) under clean lab conditions. Cation exchange columns loaded with Eichrom® Sr spec resin and pre-conditioned with 3N HNO3 were prepared and the 0.5 ml samples were then loaded. Column blanks consisted of 0.5 ml of 3N HNO3. Columns were washed four times with 0.3 ml of 3N HNO3 and then strontium was eluted into 4 ml Teflon® vials with 1 ml of 0.05N HNO3 and 3 ml of ultrapure deionized water (Milli-Q, Millipore) following Horwitz et al. [87]. Sample concentrations are measured and corrected to optimal range. Linear normalization of sample results was applied based on within-run trends in SRM 987 relative to its accepted value (0.710255). Analytical precision on repeated standard measurements was ± 0.00003. Carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses were performed in the Department of Anthropology’s Stable Isotope Laboratory and the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Approximately 700 μg of the prepared sample was weighed into individual vessels and reacted with 100% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) at 70°C in an automated Kiel III carbonate device in which CO2 is liberated from enamel, cryogenically distilled, and subsequently flowed to a Finnigan MAT 252 isotopic ratio mass spectrometer. Two laboratory standards (NBS18 and NBS 19) were interspersed, and replicates were run to ensure accuracy. Analytical precision is typically ±0.07‰ for δ13C and ±0.14‰ for δ18O. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s004 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326421.s005 (DOCX) We are grateful for the assistance of Stanley H.

The world’s largest asset manager has reportedly turned on US Treasuries. In a report seen by Bloomberg, BlackRock Investment Institute strategists recently upgraded their view on European government bonds from slightly underweight to neutral, comparing them positively to US government debt obligations. BlackRock also notes that the Federal Reserve may hold back on cutting interest rates due to sticky inflation, while high budget deficits might urge investors to ask for a higher yield premium to hold long-dated US bonds. “We prefer euro area government bonds and credit over the US. Yields are attractive, and term premium has risen closer to our expectations relative to US Treasuries.” The BlackRock strategists specifically highlight bonds from Italy and Spain. The asset manager isn’t the only financial giant to take a less optimistic view of US Treasuries. Goldman Sachs market strategists also recently lowered their forecasts for US Treasury yields on the basis that the Federal Reserve will most likely begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Goldman’s economists originally predicted the Fed would only enact one rate cut near the end of the year, but they are now expecting cuts in September, October and December. The Financial Times recently reported that $11 billion in US long-term bond funds focused on government and corporate debt were sold in only three months. The second quarter sell-off ends a three-year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous sell-off occurring in 2022 Q2.

U.S. stock futures are ticking higher as investors continue to monitor the White House for updates on tariff policies; Nvidia (NVDA) stock approaches a $4 trillion market capitalization; Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion; U.S.-listed shares of Verona Pharma (VRNA) are jumping in premarket trading after Merck (MRK) agreed to purchase the company for $10 billion; and AES (AES) shares are soaring on a report that the renewable energy provider is exploring a potential sale. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors watch for more tariffs developments. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.2% after the blue-chip index shed 0.4% in the prior session. S&P 500 futures are edging higher after the benchmark index declined slightly yesterday, while Nasdaq futures are up slightly after the tech-heavy index inched higher Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is ticking higher to trade at around $109,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is little changed. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are declining. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus as the AI chipmaker comes close to becoming the most valuable company in history. Nvidia stock rose just over 1% Tuesday to close at an all-time high of exactly $160, pushing its market capitalization to $3.90 trillion. That's just below Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion last December. Nvidia could reach a market cap of $4 trillion if its share price moves to $163.93. Nvidia shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion. CNBC said that "almost 30 domestic and foreign private equity firms in China have submitted non-binding offers," adding that Starbucks may retain a 30% stake. According to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter, most prospective investors in Starbucks' Chinese business "are eyeing a controlling stake in the operation." Starbucks shares are nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. U.S.-listed shares of London-based Verona Pharma (VRNA) are surging 20% in premarket trading after the firm agreed to be acquired by U.S. drug giant Merck (MRK) for $107 per American depositary share, or about $10 billion. The acquisition will add chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment Ohtuvayre, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in June 2024, to Merck's drug portfolio. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. AES (AES) shares are soaring nearly 15% in premarket trading on a Bloomberg report that the renewable energy provider "is exploring options including a potential sale amid takeover interest." AES has signed deals several tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), to provide renewable power for data centers. Infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Brookfield Asset Management "have been studying AES after the company's shares lost about half their value over the past two years," the report said.

Title: Challenge of predicting Texas floods and SCOTUS allows for mass federal layoffs: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Meteorologists and forecasting experts say the severity of the deadly Texas floods couldn’t have been predicted. The Supreme Court allows Donald Trump to move forward with mass firings. And more pet owners are opting into insurance for their furry family members. Here’s what to know today. At least 161 people are missing after catastrophic floods tore through the Texas Hill Country, Gov. Greg Abbott said yesterday, as the desperate search for survivors continues. The death toll rose to at least 110 people. Meanwhile, scrutiny and questions are mounting about how and when people in the area received flash flood alerts. Among those questions: What actions were taken to notify residents? Were emergency alerts adequate, and who issued them? It was also unclear whether alerts were received on all phones. At a news conference yesterday, local officials and law enforcement in Kerr County couldn’t provide basic details of the emergency response. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. While National Weather Service forecasters had warned broadly about flash flooding ahead of time, the best weather models could not have predicted precisely where the most intense rainfall would land, or that the deluge would stall out over a flood-prone basin, meteorologists and forecasting experts said. Texas state climatologist John Neilsen-Gammon called such a prediction “next to impossible.” What did happen was that “all the ingredients came together at the wrong place, at the wrong time, at night on a holiday weekend,” said David Gagne, a National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist. Though NOAA is working to build better weather models, that research is on the chopping block. As science reporter Evan Bush explains, a succession of thunderstorms fed by the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry hit the region. Weather charts showed that the south fork of the Guadalupe River took a direct and prolonged hit. Then, instead of moving on, the storms stalled and dumped 10-12 inches of rain over six hours. Making matters worse, the area — consisting of steep hills and narrow canyons that rapidly funnel water from smaller creeks into swollen rivers — was filled with campers near the river’s edge. If the storm had been even five miles in another direction, it would not have produced as much destruction, Nilsen-Gammon said. Read the full story here. The Supreme Court has allowed President Donald Trump, at least temporarily, to move ahead with plans to impose mass firings of the federal workforce and reorganize various government agencies. The decision affects 19 federal agencies, as well as the White House-adjacent Office of Management and Budget, Office of Personnel Management and U.S. DOGE Service. The court’s decision yesterday was a response to a ruling from California-based U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, who blocked Trump’s plans in May, saying that while the president can seek to make changes to the workforce, there are limits when they are done wholesale. The Trump administration, however, argued that the president does not need permission from Congress to carry out his duties as stated in the Constitution. The justices made clear that their order is not about the legality of any individual agency reduction in force or reorganization plan, only the legality of Trump’s executive order and an administration memo related to workforce plans. Ketanji Brown Jackson, the only justice to provide a written dissent, sharply criticized the decision as “hubristic and senseless.” Read the full story here. Small-town hospitals are buckling under strain from Trump’s sprawling domestic policy bill, signed into law last week. It includes sweeping cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and could result in millions of Americans losing health care coverage. The package includes $50 billion for rural hospitals, though it won’t be enough to offset the Medicaid and ACA cuts, one expert said. Now, hospitals are already considering how to adapt to a shifting budget, even if some of the Trump bill’s changes won’t take effect for a few years. Some smaller hospitals are already closing their doors due to growing financial strain. The Nebraska-based Community Hospital said last week that it’s shutting down its medical center in Curtis, a town of around 900 people. In Hugo, Colorado, Kevin Stansbury, the CEO of the Lincoln Community Hospital and Care Center, said he may soon have to start cutting services for patients at the 25-bed rural hospital. And in Kansas, Benjamin Anderson, CEO of Hutchinson Regional Healthcare System, said he’s evaluating how the only hospital for many residents of South Central Kansas will be able to keep offering all of its services, which include hospice and home care, women’s health and pediatric care. Read the full story here. My cat Macaroni is pretty unusual, and not only because he can whine loud enough to be heard two floors down or because he’s missing a back left paw — but because he’s insured. Most pet owners don’t buy coverage for their animals. Of the nearly 90 million dogs and almost 74 million cats in the U.S., both species’ insured rates remain in the single digits. But that’s changing fast, as business intern Evie Steele reports. Spending on pet insurance has grown by at least 20% each year since 2020, hitting more than $4.7 billion last year, according to one industry estimate. Evie found consumers have strong opinions on whether pet insurance is worth it — most policies don’t cover pre-existing conditions — but analysts broadly expect the market to keep growing. — Rich Bellis, senior business editor The discounts are just starting on the second day of Amazon Prime Day.

ByMartine Paris ByMartine Paris, Contributor. Learning to work with AI. With AI being credited for doing half the work at Salesforce by CEO Marc Benioff, a growing number of companies have been firing teams in response to the rise in AI adoption. Here’s a running list of layoffs. Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos space venture, is axing 1,000 jobs, nearly 10% of its workforce, to restructure for automation. Bumble is laying off 30% of its team, about 240 people, to better compete with AI-powered dating apps like Hinge. Business Insider is cutting 21% of its team as it goes all-in on AI to respond to the decline in Google search traffic. Dropbox downsized by 20% at the end of last year in its transition to AI offerings. Google, whose AI summaries are accelerating the demise of search traffic, has offered early retirement to its Search, Ads and Commerce teams. IBM slashed nearly 9,000 jobs, mostly in human resources as AI agents automate administrative tasks. Intel plans to layoff up to 20% of its factory workers as it pivots to AI. The company had over 100,000 employees at the end of last year. JPMorganChase is expecting a 10% reduction in operations staff as the company tells managers to do more with less, lean into AI, and focus on efficiencies. Meta is cutting 4,000 jobs, about 5% of its workforce, while doubling down on AI, poaching talent from OpenAI and hiring former Github CEO Nat Friedman to co-head its new Super Intelligence Labs with Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang. Microsoft eliminated 15,000 jobs this year, nearly 7% of its workforce, despite strong earnings, with CEO Satya Nadella citing 20% to 30% of its code now being written by AI tools. Company-wide sales, marketing, product and engineering teams, gaming divisions including Xbox, and management layers across the board are getting slashed. Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI will wipe out half of all white collar jobs in the coming years. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said AI could spike unemployment by 20%. And Nvidia just became the first-ever $4 trillion company. Clearly, this is just the beginning. Backlash has been significant against companies announcing AI-first strategies, like Duolingo, Klarna and Shopify, which were met with sharp criticism for suggesting contractors could be replaced by AI. Other tech giants have been scrambling with messaging. Amazon, which just celebrated deploying its 1 millionth robot in fulfillment centers, told Fast Company that despite widely reported rumors, it did not put 14,000 positions on the chopping block. And although Block, formerly known as Square, is eliminating 1,000 jobs, about 8% of staff, its co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said the move is not to replace workers with AI. Despite mass layoffs, one engineer, Soham Parekh, managed not only to land several tech jobs, but work them simultaneously. He became a meme last week when his skill at beating the recruiting machine went viral. Amid the frenzy of posts were prominent AI investors Reid Hoffman and Mark Cuban. Box CEO Aaron Levie opined, “If Soham immediately comes clean and says he was working to train an AI Agent for knowledge work, he raises at $100M pre by the weekend.” Updated with Nvidia $4 billion market cap news.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold Netflix Stock Ahead Of Q2 Earnings?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BANGKOK, THAILAND - JUNE 27: The Netflix and Squid Game logos are seen in front of the Giant Swing ... More and Wat Suthat Thep Wararam in Bangkok, Thailand on June 27, 2025. Netflix Squid Game Season 3 has been released on June 27, 2025. (Photo by Valeria Mongelli/Anadolu via Getty Images) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is anticipated to announce its Q2 2025 earnings on Thursday, July 17, 2025. According to consensus estimates, revenues are expected to reach approximately $11 billion for the quarter, representing a 15% increase compared to the previous year, while earnings are projected to be $7.06 per share, up from $4.88 during the same period last year. This growth is likely to be driven by recent price hikes and increasing advertising revenue. Earlier this year, Netflix raised the cost of its standard HD plan by $2.50 to $18 per month and increased the price of the Premium plan to $25 per month. The company has also been concentrating on enhancing its advertising technologies, launching its in-house ad tech platform in the U.S. this past April. This initiative could help improve ad capabilities and pricing realizations. Year-over-year revenue comparisons will also benefit from stronger subscriber counts over the last year, partly driven by the crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of the ad-supported tier, even though the impact of these initiatives may start to lessen. We will also monitor Netflix's margins for the quarter closely. This year, Netflix's content costs are expected to increase. While the company has generally focused on scripted entertainment, it is currently branching out into live sports, which may entail higher production and licensing expenses. Netflix has a current market capitalization of $551 billion. Over the last twelve months, revenue totaled $40 billion, with the company being operationally profitable, reporting $11 billion in operating profits and net income of $9.3 billion. Therefore, if you’re looking for upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its launch. View earnings reaction history for all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for the 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings is summarized along with the statistics in the table below. NFLX 1D, 5D, and 21D Post Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (though not beneficial if the correlation is low) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns after earnings, identify the pair with the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader could take a “long” position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. The correlation labeled 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NFLX Correlation Among 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns Discover more about the Trefis RV strategy, which has exceeded its all-cap stocks benchmark (a mixture of all 3: the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000) to yield substantial returns for investors. In addition, if you're looking for upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock like Netflix, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception.

Title: See the billionaires and CEOs at the Sun Valley 'summer camp for billionaires' this year

For tech and media moguls, Sun Valley is the place to be this week. The annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, is hallowed ground where billionaires and CEOs rub shoulders and strike deals. Allen & Co., the organizer of the off-the-record event, is a boutique investment firm. Over the years the summit has hosted the likes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. Sun Valley has also played a part in major deals over the years, such as Disney's acquisition of ABC and Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal. The summit kicked off Tuesday and is set to go through the weekend. Here's a look at who's attending this year: OpenAI chief Sam Altman arrived in Sun Valley wearing a simple navy blue T-shirt and chunky white sunglasses from Vuarnet. The glasses, inspired by 1970s ski masks, retail for $410, according to the brand's website. Altman's entry into Sun Valley comes shortly after he said last month that Meta was "crazy" for trying to poach top AI talent from OpenAI with $100 million signing bonuses. He was also joined at the conference by OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet — Google's parent company, wore an all-blue outfit on the first day of the conference, with a button-down, indigo jeans, and dark sunglasses. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, arrived in Sun Valley in his signature simple style, wearing a navy polo, square-rim black glasses, and a fitness tracker on his wrist. He had a bag slung over his shoulder and waved to the cameras. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek stuck to founder-core fashion at Sun Valley in a black zip-up hoodie, a matching polo underneath, and dark denim. He carried a notebook. Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg arrived in Sun Valley hand in hand with her husband, Tom Bernthal, the former CEO of consulting agency Kelton Global. The pair was dressed for comfort — Sandberg wore a cropped black cardigan with a black top under, paired with light-wash blue jeans, while Bernthal wore a collared cream sweater and gray slacks. Sandberg stepped down from Meta in 2022. She is the founder of LeanIn.Org, a nonprofit organization for women. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy came to Sun Valley in a printed T-shirt with a blue button-down thrown over, paired with black sunglasses. The Sun Valley retreat comes shortly after Jassy said AI will eliminate some jobs at Amazon, but create some roles in AI and robotics. On the first day of the conference, Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, wore a white polo shirt and black-tinted sunglasses to complete the look. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, arrived at Sun Valley on day one sporting a navy Thalia Surf baseball cap, a Rivian logo tee, and a smart fitness tracker. He recently talked to BI about the impact President Donald Trump's new Big, Beautiful Bill would have on Rivian, an EV company. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, wore a navy polo with contrast piping, an SV25-branded cap, and sleek frameless glasses for the occasion. Nadella recently said that the hardest challenge with AI was not building or deploying it, but rather getting employees to change the way they work. Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone opted for a laid-back style at Sun Valley — dressed in a navy crewneck tee, gray utility pants, and black sunglasses hanging from his collar. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wore athleisure at Sun Valley: a fitted blue T-shirt, a navy SV-branded cap, and dark shades hanging from his collar. He had a sweatshirt tied around his waist and a cup of coffee in his hand. The CEO recently weighed in on an important question many Uber users have: when customers should tip.

For tech and media moguls, Sun Valley is the place to be this week. The annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, is hallowed ground where billionaires and CEOs rub shoulders and strike deals. Allen & Co., the organizer of the off-the-record event, is a boutique investment firm. Over the years the summit has hosted the likes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. Sun Valley has also played a part in major deals over the years, such as Disney's acquisition of ABC and Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal. The summit kicked off Tuesday and is set to go through the weekend. Here's a look at who's attending this year: OpenAI chief Sam Altman arrived in Sun Valley wearing a simple navy blue T-shirt and chunky white sunglasses from Vuarnet. The glasses, inspired by 1970s ski masks, retail for $410, according to the brand's website. Altman's entry into Sun Valley comes shortly after he said last month that Meta was "crazy" for trying to poach top AI talent from OpenAI with $100 million signing bonuses. He was also joined at the conference by OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet — Google's parent company, wore an all-blue outfit on the first day of the conference, with a button-down, indigo jeans, and dark sunglasses. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, arrived in Sun Valley in his signature simple style, wearing a navy polo, square-rim black glasses, and a fitness tracker on his wrist. He had a bag slung over his shoulder and waved to the cameras. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek stuck to founder-core fashion at Sun Valley in a black zip-up hoodie, a matching polo underneath, and dark denim. He carried a notebook. Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg arrived in Sun Valley hand in hand with her husband, Tom Bernthal, the former CEO of consulting agency Kelton Global. The pair was dressed for comfort — Sandberg wore a cropped black cardigan with a black top under, paired with light-wash blue jeans, while Bernthal wore a collared cream sweater and gray slacks. Sandberg stepped down from Meta in 2022. She is the founder of LeanIn.Org, a nonprofit organization for women. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy came to Sun Valley in a printed T-shirt with a blue button-down thrown over, paired with black sunglasses. The Sun Valley retreat comes shortly after Jassy said AI will eliminate some jobs at Amazon, but create some roles in AI and robotics. On the first day of the conference, Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, wore a white polo shirt and black-tinted sunglasses to complete the look. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, arrived at Sun Valley on day one sporting a navy Thalia Surf baseball cap, a Rivian logo tee, and a smart fitness tracker. He recently talked to BI about the impact President Donald Trump's new Big, Beautiful Bill would have on Rivian, an EV company. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, wore a navy polo with contrast piping, an SV25-branded cap, and sleek frameless glasses for the occasion. Nadella recently said that the hardest challenge with AI was not building or deploying it, but rather getting employees to change the way they work. Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone opted for a laid-back style at Sun Valley — dressed in a navy crewneck tee, gray utility pants, and black sunglasses hanging from his collar. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wore athleisure at Sun Valley: a fitted blue T-shirt, a navy SV-branded cap, and dark shades hanging from his collar. He had a sweatshirt tied around his waist and a cup of coffee in his hand. The CEO recently weighed in on an important question many Uber users have: when customers should tip. "Tipping is entirely optional," Khosrowshahi said in a June interview on CBS Sunday Morning. "But if you feel like you got a good ride, if the service quality was terrific, then you can tip through the app." General Motors' CEO, Mary Barra, arrived in Sun Valley wearing a crisp white blouse with flared cuffs, paired with beige trousers. She accessorized the outfit with a quilted black Dior tote, a black portfolio, and a pair of black sunglasses, which she carried in her hand.

Title: Temasek reports $45 billion rise in net portfolio value to $434 billion

PHOTO: ST FILE Timothy Goh Sue-Ann Tan Published Jul 09, 2025, 03:00 PM Updated Jul 09, 2025, 09:38 PM SINGAPORE – Singapore investment company Temasek’s net portfolio value came in at $434 billion for the financial year ended March 31, 2025, up $45 billion from a year ago. The increase was mainly due to the strong performance of listed Singapore-based Temasek portfolio companies and direct investments in China, the United States and India, the company said on July 9, adding that the $434 billion net portfolio value is a record high. Net portfolio value represents the total market value of listed assets and the book value of unlisted assets in an investment portfolio minus any liabilities. It provides a clear picture of the actual worth of the portfolio at a given point in time. In a measure of Temasek’s long-term portfolio performance, the 20-year total shareholder return (TSR) stayed at 7 per cent for a second year straight. The one-year TSR, which is more volatile, came in at 11.8 per cent, up from the 1.6 per cent in financial year (FY) 2024, driven by robust performance from Temasek’s Singapore-based portfolio companies, as well as strong returns in the US, China and India. The 10-year TSR came in at 5 per cent, down slightly from 6 per cent the year earlier, as the strong returns from March 2015 – a year of favourable market performance – dropped out of the measurement period. When it comes to marking its unlisted assets to market, Temasek’s net portfolio value hit $469 billion, an increase in value of $35 billion from a year ago. Mark-to-market value is an accounting practice that involves recording the value of an asset according to its current market price, rather than its book value or original cost. The investment company has been disclosing the mark-to-market value of its unlisted assets since 2022. Temasek’s listed investments comprise 51 per cent of its investment portfolio. Temasek deputy chief executive Chia Song Hwee said the firm’s Singapore-based portfolio companies’ strong performance this year demonstrates their progress in executing strategies aligned with their “stated targets”. “It affirms our ongoing active engagements with them to strengthen their business foundations, pivot and de-risk where necessary, and drive value creation,” he said. “We have been sharpening our investment discipline through more active portfolio management and will maintain this rigorous approach to enhance our returns over the long term.” Of Temasek’s portfolio, 41 per cent is in Singapore-based Temasek portfolio companies, which include household names such as DBS Bank, Singapore Airlines and Singtel. Another 36 per cent is in global direct investments, which are established or emerging market leaders aligned with the four structural trends of digitisation, sustainable living, the future of consumption and longer lifespans. These firms include Shopee parent Sea and investment giant BlackRock. The remaining 23 per cent of the portfolio is held in partnerships, funds and asset management firms, including entities such as venture capital firm Vertex, asset management group Seviora and private equity firm 65 Equity Partners. Singapore remains the biggest market for the company, accounting for 27 per cent of its underlying assets in FY2025. A total of 52 per cent of Temasek’s portfolio companies are also headquartered in Singapore. The Americas are Temasek’s second-biggest market at 24 per cent, while the company’s underlying exposure to China dipped slightly to 18 per cent from 19 per cent a year earlier. Exposure to Europe, the Middle East and Africa stood at 12 per cent, and India at 8 per cent. Temasek chief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani said the firm’s direct investments in markets like China, the US and India contributed to the uplift in its net portfolio value over the year. “The growth reflects both the impact of shifting macroeconomic conditions on asset prices and the long-term prospects of our investments aligned with structural tailwinds in these markets,” he said. “We will continue to actively invest in our key markets while also exploring new markets of scale that can add to our portfolio resilience.” In FY2025, the company invested $52 billion in areas aligned with the four structural trends of digitisation, sustainable living, the future of consumption and longer lifespans. It divested $42 billion, which included a full divestment in liquefied natural gas company Pavilion Energy as well as partial divestments in fashion firm Moncler, food technology company Eternal (formerly known as Zomato) and Fullerton Financial Holdings. Temasek said these divestments allowed the firm to recycle capital and continue investing in companies that are aligned to the trends, such as food technology start-up Rebel Foods and snacks company Haldiram’s. The result is a net investment of $10 billion, compared with a net divestment of $7 billion in FY2024. Temasek has also made strides in its sustainable investments. Its portfolio value of investments aligned with the sustainable living trend reached $46 billion, up $2 billion from FY2024. Financial services as well as transportation and industrials remain the two largest sectors that Temasek is invested in. The investments are in a mix of listed and unlisted assets, with listed assets accounting for 51 per cent of the portfolio and unlisted assets accounting for the remaining 49 per cent. Looking ahead, Temasek said geopolitical tensions remain a key risk, which will likely dampen global growth. But it continues to hold a “constructive outlook” on investment opportunities, despite heightened trade and geopolitical uncertainties. Temasek noted that the US will remain a key investment destination while the company continues to maintain a diversified global exposure through its investments primarily in Europe, China and India. It also highlighted that Singapore’s economy will likely come under pressure this year, but the Republic has “ample fiscal and monetary policy levers that can be pulled” in the event of a more challenging growth backdrop. To build a resilient portfolio in the Republic, Temasek will continue to actively engage its Singapore portfolio companies to enhance value and future-proof their businesses. It will also work with partners and innovators, creating “synergistic networks” with them to further grow its capital and gain access to innovation. Temasek chairman Lim Boon Heng said that like Singapore, Temasek and its Singapore portfolio companies have benefited from globalisation, expanding their footprint regionally and beyond. “Despite increasing global uncertainties, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to building a purpose-driven institution and constructing a portfolio that delivers sustainable returns over the long term,” he said.

Title: Bitcoin supply drops, institutions load up $164M in BTC – Will prices follow?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=509343
Time Published: 2025-07-09T07:00:39Z

Bitcoin demand surges as institutions and whales accumulate, signaling potential continuation of the current bullish run. Global demand for Bitcoin [BTC] has been rising steadily. Institutions and crypto whales are increasingly accumulating BTC, while adoption from traditional finance continues to grow. This trend is reflected in the surge in open interest across crypto markets. Recently, BlackRock added approximately 1,388 BTC, worth around $164.3 million, to its portfolio, underscoring institutional interest. At the same time, whale activity has intensified, with several large wallets acquiring significant amounts of Bitcoin. Such coordinated accumulation typically signals strong long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value, particularly among experienced, well-capitalized investors, often referred to as ‘smart money.’ Digging deeper into on-chain sentiments, BTC’s surge in Open Interest (OI) across derivatives platforms supports the growing demand. OI—essentially the total number of outstanding contracts, has been climbing steadily for the last month. This suggests that more capital is entering the market, both in anticipation of upward moves and as a hedge against volatility. Source: CoinGlass What makes this trend even more significant is that apart from retail driving the volume. Institutional capital, mostly flowing in through ETFs and other regulated products, is becoming a dominant force. This shift could build a stronger and more stable foundation for BTC’s next rally. According to CryptoQuant’s 30-day Apparent Demand metric, Bitcoin is experiencing steady accumulation. This on-chain indicator tracks broader demand trends while filtering out short-term market noise. AMBCrypto’s analysis of the same data also points to a positive demand outlook based on the 30-day sum. Historically, similar accumulation patterns have often preceded bullish rallies. When paired with ongoing institutional interest, this trend paints an encouraging picture of a potential demand-driven uptrend for BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Going hand in hand, the number of declined mined blocks also adds more weight to BTC bullish trends. The number of mined Bitcoin blocks has decreased recently, slowing the rate at which new BTC enters circulation. This creates a supply shortage, even as demand from whales and institutions continues to rise. This decline in supply strengthens Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, especially in a market where buying pressure from large investors is steadily increasing. Source: CryptoQuant With supply shrinking and demand rising, market dynamics are shifting in favor of further BTC price surges.

Title: For 14 years, Netanyahu has sought to nuclearly dismantle Iran and Pakistan, by Alfredo Jalife-Rahme
URL: https://www.voltairenet.org/article222640.html
Time Published: 2025-07-09T05:43:49Z
Full Content:
Statements made by Benjamin Netanyahu in 2011 shed surprising light on his policy toward Iran. It could be that revisionist Zionists see themselves as protectors of the West. In this case, Iran’s ambition to master nuclear fusion would threaten transnational oil companies, and an attack on Iran would herald a future attack of Pakistan. Fourteen years ago, the talmudic and eschatological Netanyahu was questioned by the casual Dana Weiss in an interview published on the Israeli government website. At the 25th minute and 33rd second mark [1], to the question: "What is the biggest problem facing the next generation, and what must we do today to solve it?" The pugnacious Netanyahu replied: "Our primary mission is to prevent a militant Islamist regime from acquiring nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of a militant Islamist regime. The first is Iran, the second is Pakistan, specifically in the event that the Taliban take over Pakistan (...) So, the first thing to do is to prevent them from obtaining nuclear weapons. That is our first mission, and the second is to find a substitute for oil." It is clear that the devitalized green agenda, now in free fall with the Trump oil company, is of Khazarian etiology. The interview with the loquacious Netanyahu took place 14 years ago, well before the defeat and withdrawal of the United States from Afghanistan under President Joe Biden—four years ago already, and 10 years after the apocalyptic interview by the same Netanyahu—while today, the takeover of Pakistan by the Taliban ruling in Kabul is less likely. Today, most of the media controlled by the Israeli lobby in the West have spent their time distorting and reinterpreting in a Byzantine manner the eschatological Talmudic hermeneutic of the belligerent and lying Netanyahu. It is obvious that for Israel and its Western bankers (the four Khazarian horsemen: BlackRock/Rothschild Bank/George Soros/Bloomberg), the main enemies of Greater Israel are the six Arab petromonarchies, the nuclear Islamic countries, Iran (with its civilian project) and Pakistan, as well as the Muslim countries with oil/gas and water (e.g. Lebanon). The real black swan of the 12-day war waged by Israel and the United States against Iran—a veritable First World War of disinformation, rife with deceptions and lies—turned out to be the unreserved support of Sunni Pakistan, a middle-ranking nuclear power, for the Shia Islamic Republic of Iran. Today, as the results, mostly hidden by censorship in Israel, become less opaque, it can be said that Pakistan now represents, more than a black swan, a "gray rhinoceros (that is there and that we don’t want to see [2]). As the fog of disinformation surrounding the 12-day war dissipates, it is instructive to see how countries in the region are positioning themselves for the very likely scenario of a future war between Israel/the United States and Iran [3]. Irfan Raja of the Turkish daily Daily Sabah (30/6/25) wonders if "Pakistan is next in line, as part of the ’Greater Israel’ project [4]." Irfan Raja quotes Julian Spencer-Churchill, an Anglosphere military strategist disguised as a Pakistan expert, as saying without blushing: "Once Israel defeats Iran, it will be Pakistan’s turn [5]." Irfan Raja points out that the destruction of Pakistan’s nuclear assets has long been on Israel’s mission list, just as Israel had incited the destruction of Iraq and its non-existent weapons of mass destruction. He recalls that at the Aspen "Festival of Ideas" 11 years ago, Khazarian zealot Jeffrey Goldberg—who had served in the Israeli military—asked retired Admiral Mike Mullen (former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) which, between Pakistan and Iran, was more dangerous to the United States, to which the admiral replied: "Probably Pakistan." [6] Of course, neither of them was going to say that Israel is now much more dangerous to democracy in the United States. In this regard, the neoliberal globalist monarchist daily Financial Times expresses its concern that "Saudi Arabia is clinging to Iran after Israel’s war." [7] It would not be unreasonable to envisage a Sunni-Shiite AS/Pakistan/Iran axis under the aegis of China. [1] « A World View Interview with Benjamin Netanyahu», Les nouvelles, 2011.

July 08, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025.

Title: After Amazon's Hit Show, New Fallout Rumor Makes A Lot More Sense

Time Published: 2025-07-09T00:00:20Z

Although the franchise has always been an iconic pillar of the RPG genre, Amazon's Fallout show helped bring the series to a much wider audience of new viewers. Not only was the record-breaking series a hit with plenty of fans, but it also caused a massive spike in player counts for Bethesda's older Fallout games. Despite the show's significant success, Bethesda seemed somewhat unprepared to take advantage of the spike in popularity, which thankfully might be changing this second time around. While it will likely be a long wait until the highly anticipated Fallout 5 makes its appearance, official confirmation of a third season for Fallout means there won't be a content drought for too long. If its first season was anything to go by, the show's follow-ups are likely to be another smashing success for Amazon, which could have some significant benefits for Fallout players. Whether we'll be getting a look at the next entry in the series or some surprise projects, a recent report is a great sign of things to come. As reported by ComicBook, Video Games Chronicle's Jordan Middler made some significant claims regarding the future of the Fallout series after the recent layoffs at Xbox. As a guest on an episode of the Friends Per Second podcast, Middler claimed that "There are multiple Fallout projects in development," which he says includes "that one I'm sure you're all wanting". While the vague statements don't explicitly confirm any specific hopes for future Fallout content, it would honestly be more of a surprise if Bethesda didn't have more Fallout projects in the works. Although the vague rumor isn't too much to go on, the idea that we could see a new major release for the Fallout series following the second or third season of the Fallout show would be a more than welcome surprise. Even if Middler says that we're "not going to be playing this game anytime soon" regarding the biggest project from the studio, it's only a part of what's coming to the series in the future. Bethesda has confirmed the upcoming Fallout 5 won't be released until some time after the next Elder Scrolls game, so it's much more likely that the next big project for the series will be in the form of a remaster. Much like Bethesda's latest The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, it's not hard to see a modern overhaul of Fallout New Vegas or the heavily rumored remake of Fallout 3 being a massive success for the studio. Even if Fallout 3 would be the more likely candidate given its in-house development at Bethesda, Fallout New Vegas is easily the more popular choice among fans, given its cult classic nature and significant ties to the show. Oblivion Remastered has been massively successful, and if a Fallout 3 remaster wants to achieve the same result, some changes will need to be made. While Bethesda may not be quite ready to announce a new sequel or even a remake by the time Fallout's second season rolls around, there's still plenty of room to take advantage of its popularity. Even mobile games like Fallout Shelter show just how much potential the series can have in other mediums, not to mention the Fallout 76 MMO still going strong years after release to show there's still plenty of love to be had for the Fallout franchise.

F1 The Movie has already become one of the most successful films of Brad Pitt's career, proving that he can still dominate the box office. From Lost to How I Met Your Mother, some TV shows amassed such a huge fan base that it was impossible for the ending to satisfy them all. Linda Hamilton is best known for her iconic role in the Terminator series, but the star recently revealed that her upcoming project is even bigger. After ten high-octane episodes, Criminal Minds: Evolution season 3 has come to an end with a last-second twist that changes everything for Voit. Jim Carrey's movie career has allowed him to play countless beloved characters, and two of them unexpectedly interacted on-screen in 1997.

Title: How to solo queue for old LFR difficulty raids to collect transmog (so much transmog)

Time Published: 2025-07-08T22:45:03Z

NEXT | All of the rewards from Manaforge Vandals in the Manaforge Omega ra... If you’re a transmog fiend, it’s okay, you’re among friends here — there’s no shame in wanting pretty outfits. And with the Collector’s Bounty event running through July 29, you’ll pick up twice the number of transmogs every run! Perfect. The easiest way to get gear from older raids, including raid sets and unique appearances, is to solo queue for LFR, which is available for most older raids that had an LFR difficulty. Currently, you can solo queue for raids from to Dragon Soul in Cataclysm to Sepulcher of the First Ones in Shadowlands, with new raids typically added two expansions later. Look for Dragonflight LFR to be added some time during Midnight. Beyond transmog, most pets can be farmed on LFR difficulty, though some mounts are restricted to Heroic or Mythic difficulty). So there are plenty of reasons to run these old raids — and solo queue LFR is trivial for any max level character to complete. But solo queuing for older raid tiers isn’t as straightforward as opening up the group finder. You have to speak to specific NPCs (usually in the capitol city of the expansion) to queue up for raids on your own. Here’s how to solo queue for LFR in old expansions to collect transmog, pets, and more. To queue for Shadowlands LFR, both factions talk to Ta’elfar in Oribos. He can be found in the Enclave, where you find Bolivar and all of the different Covenant NPCs. You can queue for all Castle Nathria, Sanctum of Domination, and Sepulcher of the First Ones. Unfortunately, the raid mounts this expansion are only available in Mythic difficulty, but there is a lot of very excellent transmog to collect at LFR level. There are two NPCs that will allow you to queue up for BFA raids on LFR difficulty, depending on whether you’re Alliance or Horde: You can queue for all wings of Uldir, Battle of Dazar’alor, Crucible of Storms, the Eternal Palace, and Ny’alotha, the Waking City. Some of the standout transmog items include Khor, Hammer of the Corrupted, Void-Binder, Glaive of the Keepers, Voror, Gleaming Blade of the Stalwart, Monstrosity’s Shipbreaker, Fang of the Behemoth, Stormtamer’s Orb. However, the G.M.O.D. doesn’t drop from Mekkatorque in LFR difficulty. If you’re looking for something a little different than the same old LFR, you can also solo queue for Island Expeditions, which offer plenty to collect. Both factions talk to the same NPC to queue for Legion LFR: in Legion Dalaran, speak to Archmage Timear, located just past the gates leading towards The Violet Hold. You can queue for all wings of The Emerald Nightmare, Trial of Valor, The Nighthold, Tomb of Sargeras, and Antorous, the Burning Throne. Transmog weapon appearances are limited here since Legion was the Artifact expansion, but there are great armor sets. Tomb of Sargeras LFR sets are excellent for transmog, and Antorus has special weapon transmogs like Taeshalach and Scythe of the Unmaker. You can also get mounts such as the Abyss Worm and the Antoran Charhound. Queuing for LFR in Warlords of Draenor is extremely simple: you just queue from your Garrison. Both Alliance and Horde should look for Seer Kazal, close to their town hall. You can queue for all wings of Highmaul, Blackrock Foundry, and Hellfire Citadel. In Warlords, LFR difficulty raids didn’t drop recolored versions of the gear from higher difficulties: instead, LFR armor resembles PVP sets. But these raids still have some pretty cool looking items, such as the Greatsword of Chaos or Soulcult Ritual Staff. To solo queue for Mists of Pandaria LFR, both factions talk to Lorewaker Han in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, standing right next to Cho up at the top of Mogushan Palace. You can queue for all wings of Mogu’shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, Terrace of Endless Spring, Throne of Thunder, and Siege of Orgrimmar. Mists was the first expansion to have LFR versions of every raid, and thus LFR versions of weapons and armor for transmog. And there’s quite a lot of really good transmog in these raids, more than I can really sum up: but standouts include Starshatter, Shin’ka, Execution of Dominion, Bo-Ris, Horror in the Night, and Iron Qon’s Boot Knife. There’s only one LFR difficulty raid in Cataclysm, and unlike later solo queues, you have to go directly to the raid entrance to queue for Dragon Soul. Just go to the raid entrance in the Caverns of Time and speak to Auridormi, the Raid Finder Guardian. Some nerfs have been made to Cataclysm raids to make them easier to solo — and collect some of those hard-to-find mounts. You can collect LFR-specific set recolors as well as some interesting weapons, such as Gurthalak. I actually think the LFR versions of these weapons are often better looking due to them having more cool off-tones like blue, like in the case of No-Kaled, the Elements of Death or the Maw of the Dragonlord. Neither Shadowlands nor Dragonflight allow you to solo queue for LFR yet, but Shadowlands will likely be added some time during the current expansion cycle. But you’ll have to wait longer for Dragonflight: don’t expect to be able to solo queue for it until the Midnight expansion. Still, there’s a lot of soloing to do (and transmog to collect) while we wait. So take heart, brave transmog addicts, not that we’re addicts and even if we are so what, it’s perfectly normal to run Dragon Soul LFR over and over and over again looking for a blue sword, don’t you judge me.

Title: The Hottest VC Deals Today Are No Revenue, No Product, Just All-Star AI Teams And Mega Rounds

ByJosipa Majic Predin ByJosipa Majic Predin, Contributor. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 06: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the OpenAI DevDay event ... More on November 06, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Altman delivered the keynote address at the first-ever Open AI DevDay conference. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The artificial intelligence industry just witnessed one of the most dramatic market distortions in Silicon Valley history. When former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s six-month-old startup Thinking Machines Lab successfully raised 2 billion dollars at a 10 billion dollar valuation, it crystallized a fundamental shift in how AI companies compete for talent. But this astronomical funding round isn’t just about one company’s ambitions - it's the direct result of a compensation arms race that began with Meta's desperate hundred-million-dollar recruiting spree. The pattern is unmistakable: Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence raised 1 billion dollars at a five billion dollar valuation with no publicly released product. Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab secured 2 billion dollars at a 10 billion dollar valuation for a company that’s existed for just 6 months. These aren’t isolated incidents-they represent the new normal in AI investing, where talent portfolios command unicorn valuations before building anything tangible. The story begins with Meta’s aggressive talent acquisition strategy. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta began offering signing bonuses as high as 100 million dollars to poach top researchers from his company. Meta offered employees of rival OpenAI signing bonuses of 100 million dollars to switch companies, with even larger annual compensation packages. While later reports clarified that no one was really getting a hundred million dollar "signing bonus", the psychological impact on the market was immediate and profound. The timing of Meta’s recruitment blitz was strategic. As AI capabilities rapidly advanced and competition intensified, Mark Zuckerberg recognized that talent, not just capital, would determine market leadership. "The List" includes five ex-OpenAI employees as Meta looks to build reasoning models to contend with rivals, highlighting the systematic nature of this talent acquisition campaign. Meta’s compensation strategy created an unintended consequence that reverberated throughout Silicon Valley. When established companies couldn’t match these astronomical packages, they inadvertently set a new baseline for AI talent expectations. Every engineer who heard about hundred-million-dollar offers - even if they didn’t receive them - began to recalibrate their own market value. This is where Murati’s funding round becomes particularly significant. Thinking Machines Lab, the secretive AI startup founded by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, has closed a 2 billion dollar seed round at a 10 billion dollar valuation. With this valuation, offering 1% equity to a senior engineer effectively provides the same hundred-million-dollar package that Meta was dangling, but with potentially unlimited upside. The mathematics are stark: in a market where top talent expects hundred-million-dollar packages, startups need billion-dollar valuations just to compete. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional equity-based compensation models where early employees accepted lower salaries in exchange for potentially valuable stock options. This phenomenon extends beyond Murati’s success. The venture capital ecosystem has fundamentally shifted its evaluation criteria for AI startups. Traditional metrics like revenue, user growth, and product-market fit have been replaced by team pedigree, publication records, and previous company affiliations. Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence exemplifies this trend, raising 1 billion dollars at a 5 billion dollar valuation with no publicly released product or service. The mathematics behind these investments reflect a new understanding of value creation in AI. When a single breakthrough algorithm can generate tens of billions in market value, investors are essentially purchasing lottery tickets with extraordinarily high potential payoffs. The team becomes the product, and their collective expertise represents the company's entire value proposition. The current landscape reveals clear winners and losers in this talent war. Established tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft can absorb massive compensation costs as operating expenses. Well-funded AI startups with venture capital backing can inflate their valuations to offer competitive equity packages. However, mid-sized companies and traditional enterprises find themselves increasingly priced out of the AI talent market. The pattern is consistent across multiple high-profile cases. Companies like Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines Lab represent a new category of “talent unicorns” - startups valued primarily on their human capital rather than their technological assets. This shift forces traditional businesses to compete not just on product features or market positioning, but on their ability to attract and retain the small pool of elite AI researchers who command these premium valuations. The AI talent market now operates under fundamentally different rules than the broader tech industry. While traditional software companies might offer senior engineers packages worth two hundred thousand to five hundred thousand dollars annually, AI companies routinely offer multimillion-dollar packages for similar roles. This disparity creates several strategic challenges for companies across the ecosystem. First, it forces non-AI companies to either dramatically increase compensation or risk losing technical talent to AI-focused competitors. Second, it creates internal equity issues when AI engineers command significantly higher compensation than equally skilled colleagues in other domains. The talent war has also accelerated the trend toward specialized AI roles. Companies are no longer just hiring "software engineers" but specifically recruiting "AI researchers," "ML engineers," and "AI safety specialists" at premium rates. This specialization further fragments the talent pool and drives up costs. Beyond individual companies, this compensation inflation has broader economic implications. It concentrates high-skilled talent in a narrow set of companies and geographic regions, potentially limiting innovation in other sectors. The astronomical valuations required to compete for AI talent also create potential bubble conditions, where companies are valued based on their ability to attract talent rather than their actual business prospects. The phenomenon also raises questions about resource allocation efficiency. When companies spend billions primarily to secure talent rather than develop products, it suggests that the current market structure may be creating significant inefficiencies. OpenAI CTO Mira Murati has reportedly doubled the amount of funding she's seeking to raise for her startup Thinking Machines Lab, indicating that even initial funding targets proved insufficient to compete effectively. The current talent war raises fundamental questions about long-term sustainability. While venture capital markets can support inflated valuations in the short term, companies ultimately need to deliver returns that justify these investments. The pressure to monetize AI capabilities quickly may lead to rushed product launches or over-promising on technological capabilities. Some industry observers argue that the current compensation levels are unsustainable and will eventually correct. However, the unique nature of AI talent—where individual contributors can have outsized impact on company success—suggests that premium compensation may persist longer than in other technology sectors. The international dimension adds another layer of complexity. While US companies engage in bidding wars for AI talent, international competitors may gain advantages by accessing talent pools with different compensation expectations. This could potentially shift the geographic center of AI innovation over time. The AI talent war represents more than just competitive hiring-it reflects the industry's belief that artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape the global economy. Companies are essentially placing multi-billion-dollar bets on their ability to attract and retain the individuals who will build these transformative technologies. Meta's hundred-million-dollar signing bonuses were intended to solve a specific recruitment problem. Instead, they created a market distortion that forced every other AI company to compete at similar levels. Mira Murati's two-billion-dollar funding round at a ten-billion-dollar valuation represents the logical conclusion of this arms race: when talent becomes the primary constraint on growth, companies will pay whatever it takes to secure it. The question now is whether this new paradigm will drive breakthrough innovations that justify the enormous investments, or whether it represents a misallocation of resources that will eventually require correction. Either way, the AI talent war has permanently altered the landscape of Silicon Valley compensation, creating new rules that extend far beyond the artificial intelligence industry itself. For now, one thing is certain: in the battle for AI supremacy, reputable AI talent has become the ultimate currency, and the price of that currency continues to climb.

Title: U.S. stocks close mixed amid tariff uncertainty

Wednesday, 09 Jul 2025 NEW YORK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, as investors weighed escalating trade threats from U.S. President Donald Trump against bullish revisions to Wall Street's outlook for the rest of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 165.60 points, or 0.37 percent, to 44,240.76. The S&P 500 sank 4.46 points, or 0.07 percent, to 6,225.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 5.95 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,418.46. Six of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer staples and utilities leading the laggards by losing 1.09 percent and 1.07 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and materials led the gainers by rising 2.72 percent and 0.53 percent, respectively. Trump reiterated his Aug. 1 deadline for finalizing trade deals, writing in a Truth Social post that "no extensions will be granted." At a Cabinet meeting later in the day, he announced a 50-percent tariff on copper imports, sending copper prices surging 13 percent to a record high. He also floated potential tariffs as high as 200 percent on pharmaceuticals and said he might notify the European Union within two days of new penalties if a deal is not reached. Trump's aggressive tone came on the heels of letters sent Monday to 14 mostly Asian countries outlining duties scheduled to take effect next month. Despite the tough rhetoric, market reaction was relatively muted. "If people believed it, we'd be down several percentage points," said market analyst Tom Essaye. "The fact that we're not means nobody believes it." He noted that while sentiment was extremely bearish in the spring, the market has become vulnerable to negative surprises now that indexes are hovering near all-time highs. In contrast to trade concerns, two major investment banks boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets. Bank of America raised its target to 6,300, citing solid corporate earnings and resilient consumer spending. Goldman Sachs lifted its forecast to 6,600 from 6,100, although chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned that the recent tech-driven rally has narrowed market breadth to its lowest level since 2023. In equity moves, major technology shares were mixed. Tesla rose 1.32 percent as the stock rebounded from Monday's drop following news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk launched a new political party. Meta Platforms and Apple inched higher, while Microsoft and Broadcom edged slightly lower. Amazon declined more than 1 percent despite kicking off its Prime Day sales event, and Alphabet also slipped about 1 percent. Nvidia was up 1.11 percent after it got a price target bump from Citi on 'Sovereign AI' demand surge. Market attention is turning to Wednesday's release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting. "This last policy meeting probably was a bit more contentious than the prior meeting in May," said Bob Lang, chief options analyst at Explosive Options. "There probably was a lot of discussion about when the next rate cut is going to be, so that's going to be important to help move markets along." Thank you for your report!

New York City's mayoral frontrunner is expected to be busy next week trying to convince the city's business leaders that he's the man for the job. Dozens of the city's business leaders are gearing up to talk with Zohran Mamdani, who clinched the Democratic nomination for mayor last month, in a series of closed-door meetings next week. The gatherings, scheduled for Tuesday, July 15, and Wednesday, July 16, in midtown Manhattan, were arranged by the Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy group. Kathryn Wylde, the chief executive of Partnership for New York City, said about 100 CEOs are expected to attend Tuesday's gathering, to be cohosted by Rob Speyer, CEO of property investor and development firm Tishman Speyer, and Albert Bourla, CEO of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. Wednesday's event will focus on leaders from the city's technology sector and is expected to be led by Kevin Ryan, founder and CEO of AlleyCorp, a venture capital firm, Wylde said. "They want to understand what his affiliation with the Democratic Socialists of America really means," Wylde said of the 33-year-old self-described socialist who rattled business leaders when he defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary. Wylde did not specify where the meetings are expected to take place, citing concerns that it could draw protesters. Andrew Epstein, a spokesperson for Mamdani, didn't return a request for comment but last month told Bloomberg that the campaign had planned to meet with NYC's business leaders this month. Mamdani clinched the Democratic primary in a city that tends to vote blue on a platform that vowed to fix housing and other affordability issues plaguing the city's residents. He has pledged to build $100 billion of new affordable housing and offer free bus service and childcare. He has proposed a 2% tax on millionaires in the city to help pay for his agenda, although he would need approval from state legislators and the governor for any new levies. "They are concerned that his campaign focused on how to solve problems by raising taxes and spending more money," Wylde said. "Does he understand that New York is in a competitive position when it comes to jobs and private investment and that there is a point at which you can't get blood out of a stone?" The Partnership for New York City boasts some powerful members, including Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, Steve Schwarzman, chairman, CEO, and cofounder of Blackstone, and David Solomon, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. Speyer and Bourla are co-chairs of the business advocacy group's board. Some business leaders have said they won't be convinced of Mamdani's viability and have banded behind incumbent mayor Eric Adams in an effort to defeat the young political star in the general election this fall. "I fully support Eric Adams and I think others will too, based on people I'm speaking with," said Jared Epstein, a Manhattan real estate executive who co-hosted a fundraiser for Adams in Bridgehampton on Long Island over the July 4th weekend with John Catsimatidis, a wealthy former Republican candidate for NYC mayor. "Mamdani is in for a rude awakening if he thinks he's going to take this city." Adams was indicted last year by federal prosecutors for accepting gifts from a Turkish official and related businesspeople. The case was dropped by President Trump's Justice Department, but it inflicted damage on Adams's candidacy, according to polls. Jump to

July 08, 2025 16:11 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. The true state of Elevance’s finances began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member. Berger Montague, with offices in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Delaware, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago, has been a pioneer in securities class action litigation since its founding in 1970.

The investment banking arm of TD Bank believes the market cap of JPMorgan will soar to $1 trillion as it leverages artificial intelligence (AI). In a new CNBC interview, TD Cowen bank analyst Steven Alexopoulos says investors are currently positioning in tech stocks to capture the upside potential of AI. The analyst notes that investors are likely underexposed to stocks that he thinks will rally once AI becomes widely adopted for commercial use. “When you think about where we are right now with AI, we’re at the builder level. The focus is Nvidia, the focus is OpenAI, the builders. I believe we’re inside of two years, maybe one, where the focus will widen out from the builders to who is going to use this technology to unlock massive economic value. That’s exactly what we saw on the internet. As the internet was being built, the focus was on Cisco, IBM, and as the layer was built, it moved to Google with search and Amazon selling commerce. When you think about the S&P 493… You need to focus on sectors that are reliant on people, knowledge workers, that is what will be disrupted by artificial intelligence.” According to the TD Cowen analyst, banks are poised to be major beneficiaries of AI advancements, with JPMorgan expected to lead the charge. Alexopoulos says that while JPMorgan’s head of consumer banking, Marianne Lake, expects the division’s headcount to decline by about 10% over the next five years, he believes that projection is conservative and anticipates a 20% reduction instead. According to Alexopoulos, JPMorgan’s growth will continue despite the significant drop in employee count. “[JPMorgan] is only richly valued relative to history, and that history did not include the most transformational technology of our lifetimes. Banks will break to a new valuation paradigm… By the end of next year, [JPMorgan] will be a trillion-dollar market-cap company.” As of Monday’s close, JPMorgan’s market cap stands at $811 billion.

Title: Peter Schiff Says Trump's Tax Cuts 'Won't Grow The Economy.' Instead, He Warns They'll Lead To Higher Interest Rates And Inflation

Economist and market commentator Peter Schiff is cautioning against President Donald Trump's latest tax and spending package, saying it could do more harm than good for the U.S. economy. A day after Trump signed the bill into law during a July 4 picnic at the White House, Schiff took to social media to argue that Trump's approach is flawed. "Trump’s tax cuts, which add to budget deficits, won’t grow the economy," Schiff posted on X. "Instead they’ll result in higher long-term interest rates and inflation." Don't Miss: According to Schiff, real growth comes from policies that boost supply, not just demand. "To grow an economy, tax cuts need to stimulate supply, not demand. They need to increase savings and investment, not consumer spending," he wrote. When one X user replied, "Consumer spending is what drives the economy," Schiff fired back, "Wrong, a productive economy enables consumers to spend." Schiff's warnings follow a wave of criticism from economists who believe the bill's impact on the federal deficit and inflation could be significant. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump's newly signed bill will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. Some economists, including Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, say the U.S. was already on an “exploding debt path” even before this legislation. "It's like the house is burning down and we're throwing in some accelerant instead of some fire extinguisher," Smetters told ABC News on Friday. "We're not too big to fail." Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf told ABC News that the bill “will make interest rates higher and makes the risks of falling into a doom loop higher than it would be otherwise.” See Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now In addition to deficit concerns, the bill includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. The CBO estimates it will result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage. AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler called it "the worst job-killing bill in American history," saying it gives “a $5 trillion gift to the wealthy while stripping support from working families.” Despite the pushback, Trump has argued that stronger economic growth and tariff revenues will offset the cost of the legislation. “Our country is going to explode with massive growth … This bill sets us on course for enormous prosperity in the new and wonderful Golden Age of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on July 1. But many economists remain unconvinced. “Bond markets can be really, really disciplinary,” Smetters told ABC News. “If we fall into a doom loop, then the U.S. has to make dramatic cutbacks in federal benefit programs like Social Security and Medicaid and sharply raise taxes. That will be really bad for people’s standard of living.” Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

Title: WEKA Debuts NeuralMesh Axon For Exascale AI Deployments
URL: https://vmblog.com:443/archive/2025/07/08/weka-debuts-neuralmesh-axon-for-exascale-ai-deployments.aspx
Time Published: 2025-07-08T17:54:00Z
Full Content:
WEKA unveiled NeuralMesh Axon, a breakthrough storage system that leverages an innovative fusion architecture designed to address the fundamental challenges of running exascale AI applications and workloads. NeuralMesh Axon seamlessly fuses with GPU servers and AI factories to streamline deployments, reduce costs, and significantly enhance AI workload responsiveness and performance, transforming underutilized GPU resources into a unified, high-performance infrastructure layer. Building on the company's recently announced NeuralMesh storage system, the new offering enhances its containerized microservices architecture with powerful embedded functionality, enabling AI pioneers, AI cloud and neocloud service providers to accelerate AI model development at extreme scale, particularly when combined with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software stacks for advanced model training and inference optimization. NeuralMesh Axon also supports real-time reasoning, with significantly improved time-to-first-token and overall token throughput, enabling customers to bring innovations to market faster. AI Infrastructure Obstacles Compound at Exascale Performance is make-or-break for large language model (LLM) training and inference workloads, especially when running at extreme scale. Organizations that run massive AI workloads on traditional storage architectures, which rely on replication-heavy approaches, waste NVMe capacity, face significant inefficiencies, and struggle with unpredictable performance and resource allocation. The reason? Traditional architectures weren't designed to process and store massive volumes of data in real-time. They create latency and bottlenecks in data pipelines and AI workflows that can cripple exascale AI deployments. Underutilized GPU servers and outdated data architectures turn premium hardware into idle capital, resulting in costly downtime for training workloads. Inference workloads struggle with memory-bound barriers, including key-value (KV) caches and hot data, resulting in reduced throughput and increased infrastructure strain. Limited KV cache offload capacity creates data access bottlenecks and complicates resource allocation for incoming prompts, directly impacting operational expenses and time-to-insight. Many organizations are transitioning to NVIDIA accelerated compute servers, paired with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, to address these challenges. However, without modern storage integration, they still encounter significant limitations in pipeline efficiency and overall GPU utilization. Built For The World's Largest and Most Demanding Accelerated Compute Environments To address these challenges, NeuralMesh Axon's high-performance, resilient storage fabric fuses directly into accelerated compute servers by leveraging local NVMe, spare CPU cores, and its existing network infrastructure. This unified, software-defined compute and storage layer delivers consistent microsecond latency for both local and remote workloads-outpacing traditional local protocols like NFS. Additionally, when leveraging WEKA's Augmented Memory Grid capability, it can provide near-memory speeds for KV cache loads at massive scale. Unlike replication-heavy approaches that squander aggregate capacity and collapse under failures, NeuralMesh Axon's unique erasure coding design tolerates up to four simultaneous node losses, sustains full throughput during rebuilds, and enables predefined resource allocation across the existing NVMe, CPU cores, and networking resources-transforming isolated disks into a memory-like storage pool at exascale and beyond while providing consistent low latency access to all addressable data. Cloud service providers and AI innovators operating at exascale require infrastructure solutions that can match the exponential growth in model complexity and dataset sizes. NeuralMesh Axon is specifically designed for organizations operating at the forefront of AI innovation that require immediate, extreme-scale performance rather than gradual scaling over time. This includes AI cloud providers and neoclouds building AI services, regional AI factories, major cloud providers developing AI solutions for enterprise customers, and large enterprise organizations deploying the most demanding AI inference and training solutions that must agilely scale and optimize their AI infrastructure investments to support rapid innovation cycles. Delivering Game-Changing Performance for Accelerated AI Innovation Early adopters, including Cohere, the industry's leading security-first enterprise AI company, are already seeing transformational results. Cohere is among WEKA's first customers to deploy NeuralMesh Axon to power its AI model training and inference workloads. Faced with high innovation costs, data transfer bottlenecks, and underutilized GPUs, Cohere first deployed NeuralMesh Axon in the public cloud to unify its AI stack and streamline operations. "For AI model builders, speed, GPU optimization, and cost-efficiency are mission-critical. That means using less hardware, generating more tokens, and running more models-without waiting on capacity or migrating data," said Autumn Moulder, vice president of engineering at Cohere. "Embedding WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon into our GPU servers enabled us to maximize utilization and accelerate every step of our AI pipelines. The performance gains have been game-changing: Inference deployments that used to take five minutes can occur in 15 seconds, with 10 times faster checkpointing. Our team can now iterate on and bring revolutionary new AI models, like North, to market with unprecedented speed." To improve training and help develop North, Cohere's secure AI agents platform, the company is deploying WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon on CoreWeave Cloud, creating a robust foundation to support real-time reasoning and deliver exceptional experiences for Cohere's end customers. "We're entering an era where AI advancement transcends raw compute alone-it's unleashed by intelligent infrastructure design. CoreWeave is redefining what's possible for AI pioneers by eliminating the complexities that constrain AI at scale," said Peter Salanki, CTO and co-founder at CoreWeave. "With WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon seamlessly integrated into CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure, we're bringing processing power directly to data, achieving microsecond latencies that reduce I/O wait time and deliver more than 30 GB/s read, 12 GB/s write, and 1 million IOPS to an individual GPU server. This breakthrough approach increases GPU utilization and empowers Cohere with the performance foundation they need to shatter inference speed barriers and deliver advanced AI solutions to their customers." "AI factories are defining the future of AI infrastructure built on NVIDIA accelerated compute and our ecosystem of NVIDIA Cloud Partners," said Marc Hamilton, vice president of solutions architecture and engineering at NVIDIA. "By optimizing inference at scale and embedding ultra-low latency NVMe storage close to the GPUs, organizations can unlock more bandwidth and extend the available on-GPU memory for any capacity. Partner solutions like WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon deployed with CoreWeave provide a critical foundation for accelerated inferencing while enabling next-generation AI services with exceptional performance and cost efficiency." The Benefits of Fusing Storage and Compute For AI Innovation NeuralMesh Axon delivers immediate, measurable improvements for AI builders and cloud service providers operating at exascale, including:

Title: 10 Prime Day Deals We Expect To Sell Out Before Day One Ends

As someone who’s been working as a shopping editor for over six years, I’ve come to know the ins and outs of Prime Day—from spotting genuinely good deals (and avoiding the bad ones) to predicting which products will sell out the fastest. For the first time ever, the sale will span four days, which means stock on popular items may be even more limited than years past. To help you find the best Prime Day deals on day one, I’ve curated a list of hot-ticket items expected to be among the first to go, including the Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects and the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler, both of which are at all-time low prices. These are the 10 Prime Day deals our deals editor predicts will sell out on day one. If you come across my curated list a little late (these products do tend to sell out quickly), I recommend heading straight to Amazon’s “Today’s Big Deals” or “Lightning Deals” sections. That’s where you’ll find the steepest markdowns on hundreds of buzz-worthy items. In any case, check out all my editor-approved Prime Day deals for day one before stock runs out. Amazon Any product with a viral following tends to sell out fast during Prime Day—and this Stanley tumbler is one of them. For context, every time the cup is released in a new colorway, stock typically runs out in minutes. So the fact that it’s majorly discounted right now leads me to believe it’ll fly off the shelves before the day (or even next hour) is over. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price it’s ever dropped to at Amazon. Amazon Year after year, the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask proves to be a top-seller during Prime Day. If you’re already hooked on its buttery-soft, hydrating formula, this is a good time to stock up. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the standard discount we’ve seen during Prime Day in the past. Amazon These whitening strips are another hot commodity during Prime Day—we often see thousands of boxes sell during the sale event. They’re also a team favorite, earning a spot in our shopping guide for the best teeth whitening kits. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. Amazon Prime Day is a great opportunity to find steep discounts on popular smartwatch models, like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7. Track your fitness routine, curate better sleep habits and monitor key stats like energy level and heart rate, all from this sleek design. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price the smartwatch has dropped to at Amazon. Amazon Similar to Stanley, Yeti is a popular brand shoppers flock to during major sale events. While plenty of Yeti designs are marked down right now, this portable cooler will come in especially handy during summer—whether you’re lounging at the park or heading to the beach. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the first time this Yeti cooler has gone on sale at Amazon. Amazon If you’ve got your eye on electronics from top brands, it’s best to check out sooner rather than later. These Bluetooth headphones are a frequent best-seller on Amazon—over 2,000 pairs were sold in the last month alone—so they’ll likely go quickly while they’re discounted to an all-time low price. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the best deal we’ve ever spotted on the earbuds at Amazon. Amazon In all my years covering Prime Day, I’ve noticed Apple AirPods 2 (alongside other models from the brand) are always among the first to sell out. It’s no surprise—they’re a staple for Apple users, whether they’re upgrading from an older model or replacing a lost pair. Why It’s A Good Deal: This price is $10 cheaper than what we saw over Black Friday. Amazon Nearly all sizes of the Samsung Frame TV—32-inch, 43-inch, 50-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch—are currently sitting at all-time low prices. This is a rare opportunity to finally splurge on the chic, smart TV—there’s no telling when it will go on sale again (or sell out). Why It’s A Good Deal: These are the best discounts we’ve ever come across on this smart TV. Amazon LED face masks are an investment, so it’s often wise to bide your time until a major sale event arrives. The HigherDose Red Light Therapy Face Mask is one of the more popular designs out there—and our top pick for the best LED face mask for comfort. It combines red and near-infrared light to target signs of aging, dullness and uneven tone. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the typical discount we’ve spotted during major sale events, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon While it might not seem like the steepest markdown at first glance, the Meta Quest 3 hardly ever goes on sale, making this a rare chance to snag the popular virtual reality device. This Amazon-exclusive Cardboard Hero bundle includes the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor and 1,000 shiny rocks to use in the Gorilla Tag game. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price this MetaQuest 3 bundle has dropped to at Amazon.

Title: Should You Invest In Bitcoin, ETFs, Or Bitcoin Treasury Companies?

ByAlexander S. Blume ByAlexander S. Blume, Contributor. Bitcoin investors have a variety of options for gaining exposure. There Are No Solutions, Only Trade-Offs” - Thomas Sowell After many years of regulatory resistance to Bitcoin, the asset has now gained approval to enter into mainstream capital markets. Starting with the approval of spot BTC ETFs to trade on January 11, 2024, various legal wrappers for BTC exposure have emerged. Recently, a notable trend has emerged as public companies add BTC to their balance sheets. Many investors likely wonder how to get best involved with this complex set of options. There are no black-and-white answers to this, only trade-offs. In this article, we will break down the pros and cons of each. Real BTC Owning actual Bitcoin, held in a personally controlled wallet of your own custody, is the original form of owning Bitcoin. Much like owning a bar of gold in your house, this offers complete control over the asset. This was the original intent of Bitcoin, an asset independent of government control or centralized authority. If custodied properly, it can not be seized or hacked or, potentially, even known that you own it. Self-custody offers a double-edged sword for many. Properly custodying Bitcoin in cold storage can result in a complete loss of your investment if not done carefully. First, the private key can be lost and unrecoverable. This famously occurred to James Howells, who accidentally disposed of the private key to access 8000 BTC, worth over $850MM today. There is no back-up for self-custody. Just as if you lost a bar of gold, it can be lost forever with no recourse. With great power comes great responsibility. In addition, ease of access to cold storage Bitcoin means that transacting may be slow. The process of accessing, transferring, or selling Bitcoin can take hours or days, which may pose a problem for some. There are alternatives to this, but they essentially remove the benefit of owning BTC directly. This includes keeping your Bitcoin on an exchange, storing your private keys in a bank or with a lawyer, or using a private key device like a Ledger to store them. This decreases the odds of you losing your Bitcoin; it also removes the self-sovereign properties that make owning Bitcoin attractive and unique. You have to trust some other party or company to keep you secure. ETFs Bitcoin ETFs are legal wrappers that allow people to gain exposure to the price of Bitcoin. They create a legal entity that holds the Bitcoin in custody on your behalf. The ETFs are regulated by the SEC and must abide by strict compliance, reporting, and security standards to be approved. This allows regular investors to make an investment in Bitcoin without having to deal with the technological peculiarities the asset poses. These ETFs are trading on major stock exchanges and can also be accessed by retirement accounts and large financial institutions that must abide by strict investment and regulatory policies. Though ETFs simplify ownership, they also neuter much of the unique protections Bitcoin can provide. You are depending on a large set of human beings to protect you. This includes the ETF creator, a firm like BlackRock or Fidelity, for example, the custodian, which is almost always Coinbase, the regulators, and market-making firms. Though all of these groups are regulated and legitimate, their incentives are not exactly aligned with every individual who wants to own bitcoin. Changes to policy, technical errors, hacks, and fraud can all arise when so many counterparties get involved. BTC Treasury Companies The latest wave of BTC exposure has come in the form of so-called Bitcoin Treasury Companies. These are public companies that hold Bitcoin rather than only USD. These vehicles offer many of the regulated protections and mainstream accessibility of an ETF and can be traded on exchanges, but add a variety of strategies and financial engineering approaches to aim to generate greater returns. These approaches can vary widely depending on the company. It can include selling more shares of stock into the market to raise more money, selling convertible debt, offering exposure across different jurisdictions in order to tap into untouched markets, trading the bitcoin using derivatives, taking out loans with the bitcoin to buy more bitcoin, and much more. For some jurisdictions, no ETF exists, and so a simple company that just buys and holds Bitcoin for shareholders may be the best option available. All of this adds another layer of human involvement to the risk of the investment. It can also mean much greater upside if chosen properly. Some of these companies trade at 10 times the value of the actual Bitcoin they hold. Though investors may be able to make more upside with BTC treasury companies, gaining exposure to intelligent strategies and retail buying momentum, they also have more risk. The same factors that can create outsized gains can create outsized losses. These are very sophisticated financial products that leverage aspects of retail speculation, debt instruments, marketing, and legal and jurisdictional arbitrage to, hopefully, outperform Bitcoin. Some of these strategies suffer from black swan-type risk, in which they will look to be doing very well until they suddenly fail. Others will be successful far out into the future. One important aspect to consider with BTC Treasury Companies is whether they are pure-play Bitcoin holding companies or does the Bitcoin complement other business activity and income. Companies that have real income may be better positioned in the long run for stability and risk management during times when the price of BTC falters, since they have other ways to pay bills and stay in business. Companies that are pure-play vehicles may have greater upside and volatility. In the end, all of these vehicles can make sense for different types of investors, from long-term individual holders to pension funds to day traders. It’s important to truly understand what the company does to generate a return for you so that you can evaluate risk with a clear perspective.

Sunak’s appointment comes after resigning from the PM role last year after a loss to Keir Starmer’s Labour Party Goldman Sachs has named former United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a senior adviser, adding a veteran policymaker to its roster as banks navigate rising geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty. The investment bank announced Sunak’s appointment on Tuesday. Sunak, who remains a Conservative member of parliament from a seat in northern England, previously worked at Goldman as an analyst in the early 2000s before joining a series of hedge funds. Through a combination of his past career in financial services and the family wealth of his wife, whose father co-founded the Indian IT services company Infosys, Sunak became the wealthiest British prime minister, drawing criticism of being out of touch with most UK voters. He has remained largely out of the spotlight since resigning as leader of the Conservatives after the party’s worst defeat in more than a century in July last year. He took up posts at Oxford and Stanford universities earlier this year. Goldman’s hiring of Sunak, who had also served as the UK’s finance minister, adds to a long list of senior politicians taking up positions in finance, where their policy backgrounds and global networks are viewed as strategic assets. “I am excited to welcome Rishi back to Goldman Sachs,” Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement. “In his role, he will work with leaders across the firm to advise our clients globally on a range of important topics, sharing his unique perspectives and insights on the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape,” Solomon said. Former British finance ministers George Osborne and Sajid Javid have also made the move to finance with Osborne holding positions at asset manager BlackRock and advisory firm Robey Warshaw and Javid becoming a partner at investment firm Centricus.

Title: David Ellison’s $8B Paramount Takeover Inches Forward as Drama Surrounds Deal

A second 90-day extension on Paramount Global’s proposed merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media was triggered yesterday (July 7), giving regulators, company executives and the Federal Communications Commission more time to finalize and agree on the deal’s terms. One key hurdle remains: the FCC’s approval to transfer CBS’s broadcast licenses to Skydance, which must come from a commission currently led by Trump-appointed Republican Brendan Carr. Importantly, any ongoing negotiations will now play out against what’s presumed to be a more favorable regulatory climate, following Paramount’s controversial $16 million settlement with President Trump announced last week. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. That legal clash with the President stemmed from Trump’s lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris, which he claimed had been unfairly edited. The settlement, which has drawn sharp scrutiny, is just the latest twist in what’s been perhaps Paramount’s most turbulent year in recent memory—a saga that’s seen the company shift from Redstone family control to the edge of a new era under David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. For decades, Paramount embodied everything old Hollywood stood for, from its air of glamour to its dynastic leadership. This is the studio that gave moviegoers The Godfather and Top Gun and TV audiences hits like Cheers and Frasier. But with a merger in motion to hand the reins to Skydance, Paramount is now poised to become something very different: a tech-forward brand working to reinvent itself in an industry that’s long since moved on from the old rules. Needless to say, the road to this moment hasn’t been smooth. If anything, the story of how Paramount got here reads less like a typical business evolution and more like one of Taylor Sheridan’s soapy dramas on Paramount+, this one featuring a media dynasty clinging to power as its empire is carved up by outsiders. The $16 million settlement with Trump wasn’t just about clearing a legal hurdle; it was also seen as a way to neutralize a potential political threat. Inside Paramount, there were real fears that Trump could use regulatory leverage to derail the Skydance merger. That concern now seems far from hypothetical. On July 3, Trump appeared to confirm the existence of a “side deal” with Ellison that’s worth between $32 million and $35 million. He was referencing what Fox Business’s Charlie Gasparino first reported as a private commitment by Ellison to run PSAs supporting Trump-aligned causes. Paramount has denied any knowledge of such an arrangement, but Trump’s comments are likely to intensify worries about editorial independence within CBS News. “What you’re seeing now is all must pay tribute to the king,” said Jon Stewart, whose The Daily Show airs on Paramount-owned Comedy Central, during a recent appearance on The Bill Simmons Podcast. Stewart added that he, too, is bracing for whatever comes next: “I’m in a spot where I can do [The Daily Show] on Monday until the company is bought out by people that don’t want anything to do with The Daily Show.” South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, whose series streams on both Comedy Central and Paramount+, took to social media to slam the merger’s fallout for their show. “This merger is a [expletive] and it’s [expletive] up South Park,” they wrote in a post circulating on Instagram, responding to a delayed premiere announcement. “We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.” The wheels for much of this were set in motion back in late 2023, when Skydance first began exploring a merger with Paramount Global. At the time, cord-cutting was accelerating, streaming losses were mounting, and Wall Street had largely lost faith in Paramount’s long-term strategy. Then–CEO Bob Bakish was holding merger talks with several potential partners, including Warner Bros. Discovery. But it was Skydance’s interest that kicked everything into gear. From the start, the deal was complicated by one name: Redstone. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, owns the family firm that effectively holds the keys to the company. Any buyer had to make her whole first, setting the stage for months of boardroom drama, internal power struggles and shareholder confusion. Skydance’s original offer, roughly $2 billion in cash and stock, triggered immediate backlash. Investors balked at the terms. Paramount’s special committee stalled. And in April 2024, Bakish was pushed out reportedly over disagreement with Redstone. The deal collapsed, and rival bidders began circling. Redstone seemed open to anything—until she wasn’t. Then, in a quiet but dramatic reversal, the Skydance talks were revived. This time, the restructured deal offered shareholders a better payout and a more straightforward path forward. By July 2024, an agreement was finalized: Skydance would merge with Paramount in an $8 billion transaction, ending the Redstone family’s decades-long grip on the studio. For many, the Redstones were synonymous with Paramount. Sumner Redstone built a sprawling media empire with ruthless focus. His daughter Shari spent years defending that legacy. But in the end, not even she could hold off the tide. Streaming hadn’t delivered, ad revenue was shrinking, and tech giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon were outpacing Paramount at every turn. David Ellison has laid out a vision centered on A.I.-assisted production, a renewed focus on tentpole films and reshaping Paramount+ into a leaner, more viable streaming platform. Still, major hurdles remain. Layoffs have already impacted hundreds. And whether Skydance can actually pull off a successful integration—blending old-school Hollywood with a tech-forward playbook—is far from guaranteed. Ellison and his team will face pressure from all directions: investors, regulators, unions and the press. But at least for now, for the first time in years, Paramount’s future is beginning to take shape—even if it means letting go of everything it once was.

Considering Fallout 76 debuted in 2018, fans of the post-apocalyptic RPG series are anxious for new quests. Although Bethesda has yet to confirm any release dates, rumors suggest that multiple games are in development. In the Friends Per Second podcast, Jordan Middler of Video Games Chronicle confirmed that Fallout 3 Remastered is still in the works. Fallout 5 is also planned, but may not arrive until 2030 or later. However, Middler also referenced a potential Fallout 2 remaster and New Vegas follow-up. Part of the broadcast centered on the recent turmoil in Xbox Game Studios. The loss of 9,000 Microsoft jobs impacted developers, leading to untimely deaths of titles like Perfect Dark. After the layoffs, Microsoft wants to focus on profitable Xbox titles and IPs, like Fallout. Fallout 3 Remastered may be one of the first projects that's ready for public consumption. It's believed that Obisidian Entertainment is partnering with Virtuous, who developed Oblivion Remastered. Still, initial leaks indicated a 2023 release date, and Bethesda hasn't provided an official update. When the title inevitably arrives, players can expect Unreal Engine 5 to power its revamped visuals. For fans who don't consider Fallout 76 a mainline game, it's been a decade since Fallout 4 arrived. Insiders don't anticipate Fallout 5 surfacing anytime soon. Sadly, Middler also doesn't see any evidence of rushed development. What's even more unclear is the timeline for other Xbox games hinted at in the podcast. Bethesda and Obsidian are considering various spinoffs and remasters. One project in particular could excite fans of the 2010 Fallout: New Vegas. For now, the TV show will have to tide supporters over until any new Fallout game is ready. The second season of the Amazon-produced series will premiere in December 2025.

U.S. equities were slightly lower at midday as the market weighed the potential impact of the latest Trump administration tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrials Average slipped 0.2%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down marginally. Shares of alternative energy firms, including Enphase Energy (ENPH), First Solar (FSLR), NextEra Energy (NEE), dipped after President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to slash most government support for the industry. Shares of Newmont (NEM) and rival gold miners declined along with the price of the precious metal as higher bond yields made gold a less attractive investment. Shares of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Goldman Sachs (GS) slipped on downgrades from HSBC, which warned it had become more cautious about bank stocks following their recent runup. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) shares gained on an upgrade from Wolfe Research, which brushed off previous concerns about the toolmaker's earnings revisions, and saw improvement in its end markets. U.S.-listed shares of Sequans Communications (SQNS) soared when the Paris-based manufacturer of semiconductors for the Internet of Things said it had raised $384 million to begin buying bitcoin.

US stock market started the week on a weak note as Dow Jones fell 160 points after President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Bangladesh. The market dip deepened as Tesla shares plunged 7% following Elon Musk’s America Party announcement. Futures for Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq also dropped further on Tuesday. Meanwhile, uncertainty around trade deals with India and the European Union and rising US Dollar index added to the pressure. With the new tariffs set to take effect on August 1, investors remain cautious. Read full story for detailed updates.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF could surpass Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings by May 2026

Current growth trajectory suggests IBIT may reach 1.2 million BTC in the next year. BlackRock’s IBIT Spot Bitcoin ETF has officially crossed 700,000 BTC in assets under management, valued at approximately $76 billion as of July 17. The milestone comes just 18 months after the fund’s launch in January 2024, marking a rapid accumulation pace that has drawn industry-wide attention. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the achievement on July 8, noting that IBIT is now 62% of the way toward surpassing Satoshi Nakamoto as the largest known single holder of Bitcoin. According to Balchunas, the fund has been adding roughly 40,000 BTC per month, or about 1,300 BTC per day, and could reach 1.2 million BTC by May 2026 if the current trend holds. In addition to its growing Bitcoin holdings, IBIT has also become a top-performing revenue generator for BlackRock. Of the asset management firm’s 1,197 ETFs, IBIT now ranks third in revenue generation at $191 billion, and it is less than $9 billion away from claiming the top spot.

"Volatility may be on summer break, but Q3 and Q4 could still deliver fireworks," the analysts wrote in a recent blog post. The current low volatility is a sign that markets have priced in a Goldilocks scenario with delayed tariffs, rate cuts from the Federal Open Markets Committee later this year, and sustained fiscal deficits, the analysts wrote. "While whales, OGs, and miners largely sidelined, Bitcoin remains just 2 to 3 percent below all-time highs," they said. "This is supported by steady inflows from ETFs and public corporate treasuries." BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which trades on the Nasdaq under the IBIT ticker, has netted nearly $53 billion in inflows since its debut 18 months ago and just reached 700,306.7922 Bitcoin in its holdings. It has been the fastest-growing exchange-traded fund in the industry's 32-year history. That means that BlackRock holds 3.52% of the 19.8 million circulating supply of Bitcoin. And Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer at Bitget Wallet, noted that the company's iShares Ethereum Trust now holds 1.5% of all ETH. "If ETF inflows continue, we could be entering the early stages of a structural supply squeeze," he said. "That means less ETH circulating on the open market, more volatility, and stronger upward pressure on price." The QCP analysts also noted that equities are "extending their melt-up rally." At the time of writing, the S&P 500 was trading at $6,226.78—up 3.6% over the past month. And the Nasdaq 100 index has gained 4.2% over the same period. Both indexes have recently hit all-time highs. QCP analysts also noted that "credit spreads are the tightest they've been since the March-April correction." Credit spreads refer to the extra yield investors demand to hold riskier corporate bonds over safer government debt. For the spread to be especially narrow is a sign of investor confidence because they're not demanding much compensation for the credit risk. The real macro signal to watch will be whether President Donald Trump can get more trade deals signed before his new August 1 deadline. Risk assets, like Bitcoin, have largely taken the new tariff deadline in stride, QCP wrote, having come to expect blustery tariff rhetoric without action. "Should Trump decide to follow through, however, the impact would be materially anti-growth," the analysts said. "It would mark a true test for global risk resilience."

War in the Middle East, The Rothschilds. The Confidential Pentagon Memo: “Take Out 7 Countries… Finishing off Iran.” Resisting War By Robert J.

Michel Chossudovsky By Prof Michel Chossudovsky and Michelle Leduc Catlin, July 08, 2025 Destabilizing the social, political and economic structure of 190 sovereign countries cannot constitute a “solution” to combating the virus. But that was the imposed “solution” which was implemented in several stages from the very outset of the corona crisis in January 2020. It’s the destruction of people’s lives. It is the destabilization of civil society. Genocide in Palestine. Displacement as Negotiation: The Ever-Enduring Logic of Plan Dalet By Rima Najjar, July 08, 2025 Today, the world is witnessing the original logic of Zionist territorial consolidation in the Levant as it mutates but persists — like a serpent uncoiling through time, holding Plan Dalet in its forked tongue and injecting it with new poison. Militarism and Organized Crime: U.S. Neocolonialism and Mass Poverty. Stephen Sefton By Stephen Sefton, July 08, 2025 Currently, the year-on-year growth figures of the largest world economies show that the economies of China and India are growing by more than 5% while the North American economy is growing by 2% on a downward trend, Japan and the United Kingdom by less than 2% and countries such as France, Italy and Germany by less than 1%. Ukraine Transformed into an “Underdeveloped Country”: Why Did BlackRock Suddenly Give Up on Zelensky and the Kiev Regime By Drago Bosnic, July 08, 2025 When the NATO-orchestrated Ukrainian conflict started in 2014, American and multinational conglomerates rushed to ensure they got their “piece of the pie” in the unfortunate country. In around a decade or so, the Kiev regime changed laws and enabled the total or near-total takeover of every remotely valuable asset built by generations in the Soviet Union.

By Kester Kenn Klomegah, July 08, 2025 Popularly referred to as BRICS, the informal group of emerging-market economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), meeting in Rio de Janeiro, has outlined a new unprecedented multitude of goals to challenge unipolar system. In the context of rising uncertainty, BRICS has further set up new models to change the economic architecture through South-South cooperation. Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” — Salvation or Disaster? Neither or Both? By Richard C.

Title: Truth Social Goes Full Crypto—SEC Considers Trump-Linked ETF Filing
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/truth-social-goes-full-crypto-sec-considers-trump-linked-etf-filing/
Time Published: 2025-07-08T15:00:55Z

US regulators have kicked off the formal review of a new spot‑crypto fund. Investors won’t know for sure if it clears the hurdles until the US Securities and Exchange Commission makes a final call. But the filing itself signals growing acceptance of directly held crypto products. According to the SEC filing, Trump Media’s Truth Social unit wants an ETF listed on NYSE Arca with 75% in Bitcoin and 25% in Ether. Yorkville America Digital would sponsor the fund, while Foris DAX Trust Company—Crypto.com’s custody arm—would hold the coins. US President Donald Trump’s team submitted the S‑1 form on June 16, starting what is likely a 45‑day review clock. Based on reports, the fund would value Bitcoin each trading day using the CME CF Bitcoin reference rate. Ether would use the CME CF Ether rate, unless the sponsor chooses another source. Private keys for both assets would sit in a cold wallet, kept separate from customer accounts. That setup aims to address long‑standing worries over hacks, theft and tangled custody failures. Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have filed pure‑Bitcoin ETF applications. Some firms are eyeing Ether‑only funds. Now a dual‑asset product is in the mix. If the SEC finalizes its planned “automated” listing framework, reviews could shrink from many months to a few. That rule would standardize disclosures, custody standards and market‑integrity checks for all spot‑crypto ETFs. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s spot‑Solana ETF hit another delay. The SEC pushed back its March 25 application and opened a new public‑comment window—21 days for feedback, 35 days for replies. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart called this hold‑up “expected,” noting it shows the agency is still fine‑tuning data and disclosures before any approvals. Now the ball is in the SEC’s court. Regulators can sign off, send back comments or reject the bid. If leadership keeps up the push for faster, automated reviews, spot‑crypto ETFs might reach market this year. Until then, every move—from amendment requests to public comments—will matter for funds backed by Bitcoin, Ether and beyond. At stake is more than branding. Fees, trading speed and trust in custody will shape which funds win big money. And sponsors will need muscle to stand out in a growing field of nearly 10 proposals. Investors should keep a close eye on filings and deadlines to know when to act. The race launched with Trump Media’s Truth Social filing, and it may well end—with approval or denial—under its banner. Truth Social’s entry has put a fresh spin on the push for regulated crypto products. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

The fund raising would be by group companies Adani Green Energy and Adani Energy Solutions, they said. The companies will be tapping private equity firms and sovereign funds from the Middle East, the US and Canada and some of the investors could be existing bond holders in the group, the sources said. Separately, the group is also negotiating a loan amount of around ₹16,000 crore with Indian banks for its airport arm. This will most likely be finalised towards the end of the year, the sources said. It will be used for the next phase of expansion of the Navi Mumbai International Airport, which is being built in phases. The airport, which is tentatively scheduled to start operations around September this year, will be able to handle 20 million passengers and 0.5 million tonne cargo annually in the launch phase. When the project is complete it will be able to handle 90 million passengers and 3.2 million tonnes of cargo. Over the last six months the Gautam Adani-controlled conglomerate has raised funds from global asset managers and funds such as Blackrock and Apollo and also from its joint venture partner TotalEnergies. In January Adani Green raised $1.425 billion, through $1.125 billion infusion by the promoter group and $300 million from TotalEnergies. The purpose of this was for early redemption of bonds and for capital optimisation. In March Adani Green again refinanced a $1.06-billion construction facility for its renewable energy projects in Rajasthan. In June it raised $750 million in a private bond issuance to fund its cement expansion. The group, which is in a perpetual expansion, growth and acquisitive mode, regularly taps the global markets for its funding needs. The group has a target to spend around $100 billion over the next 6-7 years. Published on July 8, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Ukraine Transformed into Underdeveloped Country: Why BlackRock Suddenly Gave Up on Zelensky and the Kiev Regime
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/blackrock-gave-up-neo-nazi-junta/5894166
Time Published: 2025-07-08T14:52:43Z
Full Content:
When the NATO-orchestrated Ukrainian conflict started in 2014, American and multinational conglomerates rushed to ensure they got their “piece of the pie” in the unfortunate country. In around a decade or so, the Kiev regime changed laws and enabled the total or near-total takeover of every remotely valuable asset built by generations in the Soviet Union. While the socialist superstate certainly had its flaws, the legacy it left in former Ukraine has never been matched by any government since the latter’s “independence” in 1991. Namely, while the country had a massive industrial sector until then and a population of 52 million, mostly well-educated and working in various specialist fields (Soviet Ukraine was a scientific and industrial powerhouse no less than Russia itself), after 1991, all this collapsed for good. By the early 1990s, relatively prosperous Ukraine turned into an underdeveloped country with only a fraction of its Soviet-era scientific and industrial potential, selling mostly agricultural products and essentially serving as a cheap resource for the political West’s brutal (neo)colonial exploitation. By the mid-2010s, NATO fully hijacked the unfortunate country and turned it over to the Neo-Nazi junta that’s now effectively conducting genocide against Ukrainians themselves. Namely, the demographic collapse is so catastrophic that it’s highly likely there’s only half of Ukraine’s 1991 population in the country at this point. The suicidal war with Russia (its closest kin) continues, while the United States is now openly demanding whatever’s left of Ukrainian resources (with even this lost to Russian all-out advance across the frontlines). In fact, the situation is so bad that the infamous BlackRock, the world’s most exploitative (neo)colonial conglomerate, has actually given up on NATO-occupied Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, it suspended work on “a multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund”, supposedly following President Donald Trump’s election win. Apparently, this prompted France to work on a replacement deal, with initial support from Germany, Poland and Italy. The report, published on July 5, further states that BlackRock ceased all efforts to “search for institutional investors in January”, effectively ending the planned $500 million fund that was intended to be secured from various Western governments, development grants and investment banks. In turn, another $2 billion from other private investors was also lost after they withdrew. The report also points out that the investment stopped due to “a lack of interest amid perceived uncertainty in Ukraine”. In other words, nobody wants to sink billions of dollars into an endemically corrupt mafia state run by Neo-Nazi goons in the middle of an unwinnable war with a military superpower nextdoor. Truly shocking. However, jokes aside, it doesn’t take an economic expert to understand that the most basic logic implies that nobody remotely sane would make that kind of investment. Worse yet, the notion of “perceived uncertainty” is even more laughable. Namely, as previously mentioned, the Russian military is now advancing on multiple fronts, meaning that this “uncertainty” is not a matter of perception, but an objective reality that any thinking investor would take into account. The Bloomberg report further states that the investment fund was scheduled to be unveiled at the “Ukraine Recovery Conference” on July 10-11 in Rome. A BlackRock spokesperson said that the conglomerate “completed advisory work for the recovery fund pro bono in 2024, but no longer has any active mandate”. Worse yet, although France promised to “step up”, it seems this is also falling through. Citing “people familiar with the matter” Bloomberg reports that “it remains uncertain how effective the plan will be without American backing”. In other words, investors from the European Union are just as skeptical as their US counterparts, which tends to happen when people are getting their information from sources other than the mainstream propaganda machine which still insists that the Kiev regime is “defeating Russia”. Numerous independent authors from around the world (particularly at InfoBRICS), have been reporting that the so-called minerals deal that the Trump administration was trying to push for since it came to power would fall through. We repeatedly argued that the minerals promised by the Neo-Nazi junta weren’t even under its control, while areas with any known resources lack the mining industry to support extraction. It would take years and tens (if not hundreds) of billions in investment just to establish it. In other words, the investors would need to give lots of money to the losing side. Expectedly, such business deals are wholly unattractive to people who don’t like losing massive financial assets. The Kiev regime tried to do everything in its power (effectively selling the entire country) to change their opinions, but to no avail. For instance, the Neo-Nazi junta frontman Volodymyr Zelensky pompously announced his $1 trillion “reconstruction plan” years ago, even promising each corporation what can only be described as free rei(g)n in oblasts (regions) they invested in. The results have been catastrophic for NATO-occupied Ukraine, with around 30% of its arable land handed over to (neo)colonialists. In addition, cheap Ukrainian agricultural products flooded European markets (after they were initially promised to starving Africans and for which Russia was blamed by the mainstream propaganda machine), resulting in massive protests by farmers across the “old continent” as their market share collapsed virtually overnight. However, even this turned out to be a bad investment, particularly after the Russian military entered the Dnepropetrovsk oblast. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: A.I. Drives Job Cuts Across Silicon Valley Giants: By the Numbers

Tech layoffs are nothing new in Silicon Valley, a region long shaped by boom-and-bust hiring cycles, speculative investment and shifting economic conditions. But in recent months, executives have offered a different explanation for job cuts: the rapid rise of A.I. So far in 2025, nearly 400 tech companies have announced layoffs, affecting close to 94,000 employees, according to TrueUp’s tech layoff tracker. Many of these roles are expected to be replaced—directly or indirectly—by A.I.-driven efficiencies. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Salesforce, for example, cut 1,000 roles earlier this year, redirecting hiring toward sales roles focused on A.I.-powered products. CEO Marc Benioff said last month that A.I. currently handles 30 to 50 percent of the company’s work, reducing the need for roles in fields like software engineering and customer support. Despite the job cuts, Salesforce remains financially strong, reporting $9.8 billion in revenue for the February-April quarter, an 8 percent year-over-year increase. Microsoft, the world’s second largest company by market capitalization, has also made significant cuts in 2025. The company laid off around 9,000 employees in July, following a separate round of more than 6,000 in May. Software engineers have borne the brunt of these reductions. Though Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to A.I., the technology’s growing role inside the company is undeniable. In April, CEO Satya Nadella disclosed that A.I. now writes about 30 percent of Microsoft’s code—a figure he expects to climb. Microsoft isn’t alone in its internal shift toward A.I. At Google, well over 30 percent of new code includes A.I. generated suggestions, CEO Sundar Pichai revealed earlier this year. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has described developing an A.I. agent with coding abilities comparable to a mid-level engineer as one of the company’s top goals for 2025. Startups across Silicon Valley are following suit, increasingly requiring A.I. fluency in hiring and day-to-day operations. In a March memo to staff, Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke wrote that A.I. use is now “a fundamental expectation,” adding that any team requesting additional headcount or resources must first prove that the task can’t be handled by A.I. Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn echoed a similar stance the following month. He told employees that headcount increases would only be approved if teams demonstrate the need for human involvement over automation. A.I. proficiency, he added, will also play a bigger role in hiring and performance reviews. On top of that, Duolingo will stop using contractors for tasks that A.I. can complete. With 2025 only halfway through, A.I.-driven workforce changes are poised to continue. In a June memo, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy laid out the company’s sweeping integration of A.I. across areas like shopping, AWS, and internal operations. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time,” he wrote, “but in the next few years, we expect this will reduce our corporate workforce as we gain efficiency from using A.I. extensively across the company.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Goldman Sachs hires former British PM Sunak as adviser

Goldman Sachs has today named former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak its senior adviser, adding a veteran policymaker to its roster as banks navigate rising geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty. For Sunak, the appointment marks a return to the bank where he first worked as a summer intern in investment banking in 2000 and later as an analyst between 2001 and 2004. "In his role, he will advise our clients globally on a range of important topics, sharing his unique perspectives and insights on the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape," Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement. The move underscores a well-established career trajectory in which former government officials often transition to finance, where their policy background and global network are seen as strategic assets. Former Chancellors of the Exchequer George Osborne and Sajid Javid also moved into the industry, with Osborne joining BlackRock as an adviser and Javid becoming a partner at investment firm Centricus. Currently, banks are placing even greater value on such experience as they seek to guide clients through an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. Sunak was the UK's prime minister between October 2022 and July 2024, and Chancellor of the Exchequer from February 2020 to July 2022. He resigned as prime minister and Conservative Party leader last year after a heavy loss to Keir Starmer's Labour Party. He is currently the MP for Richmond and Northallerton.

Title: Own Gold, but Avoid the Golden Haircut
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/own-gold-but-avoid-the-golden-haircut/
Time Published: 2025-07-08T13:52:22Z
Full Content:
By Byron King PostedJuly 8, 2025 Today, we’ll discuss why you should own gold. But first… Let’s say that you walk into a bank. You hand the teller a $10-bill and ask for a roll of quarters, worth $10. Seems easy, right? It’s no big deal. Perhaps you want some quarters in case you must feed a parking meter or use the washer-dryer machines at a laundromat. A basic roll of quarters, $10-worth… plus tax. So, the teller hands you a roll of quarters, smiles, and says, “Here you go. Oh, and there’s $0.60 tax, too. It’s the new, 6% sales tax on transactions.” And you say, “Huh? I’m just exchanging paper currency for metal coins. And there’s tax?” “Yup,” says the teller. “The state government just passed an act saying that this kind of exchange is a ‘transaction’ under commercial law, subject to sales tax. And we’re required to collect it.” You stand there, totally perplexed as in… You. Must. Be. Kidding. Well, yes and no. I’m sort of kidding, but I’m not really kidding because… Hey, welcome to Maryland. Okay, don’t panic (not yet). Because right now there’s no Maryland sales tax if you go to the bank and exchange paper currency for every-day, widely used coins like quarters. But there is a new 6% Maryland tax if you exchange dollars for gold. Call it the new, golden haircut. The tax applies even to gold coins issued by the U.S. Mint, the same federal entity that produces those (so far) untaxed quarters. But quarters are not made from gold, which for some bizarre reason Maryland thinks is alright to tax. It used to be that Maryland taxed sales of gold under $1,000, but not over that number. The idea was that anything over $1,000 was an investment, not subject to sales tax. As a matter of course, Maryland gold dealers typically explained to customers why they should buy at least a little bit over $1,000 of gold at a time. Say, $1,005 or $1,010. Avoid the sales tax. But as of July 1, 2025, buying all forms of gold in Maryland is subject to sales tax. For example, $1,000 of gold will cost you $1,060. Or $10,000 of yellow metal will set you back $10,600. Etcetera… Do the math. The government’s take is 6%. This is all part of a new tax bill from the collective geniuses who make laws from their political power perch in the state capital of Annapolis. This past spring, the legislature of the Terrapin State passed a so-called “Blueprint for Maryland’s Future,” loaded with all manner of new spending – upwards of $3 billion – on schools, teacher training, education-related grift, and innumerable other stuff. But there was a problem with the new spending bill; it’s that the state treasury lacks funds to pay for all these high and lofty ambitions. So the new bill also increased taxes on a long list of items, notably applying state sales taxes to gold bullion over that former $1,000 level. The state anticipates a haul of about $3 million per year (yes, million with an “m.”) In the runup to passing this new spend-and-tax bill, a coalition of Maryland businesses that sell gold coins and bullion lobbied against the idea. They noted the likely miniscule government take from the new tax, versus the hassle to businesses. Truly, it’s a small drop in a big bucket. This business group also made the obvious point that customers can easily drive across state lines and buy gold in jurisdictions without sales tax on the metal: Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Delaware come to mind, as well as most of the rest of the country. Maryland gold buyers can always go elsewhere. When you consider that buying even a single, one-ounce U.S. gold Eagle coin involves handing over $3,500 or more, depending on dealer markup, it’s a stretch to believe that anyone will pay an extra 6% to conduct their gold business in Maryland. As even a casual glance at a map will show, geographically the state is perfectly shaped for its gold-buying citizens to drive up or down the proverbial road to somewhere else. And the Marylnd business coalition pointed out that the tax increase would likely wreck the in-state gold-selling aspect of many businesses by reducing volume, perhaps killing the gold-side entirely. And these businesses would possibly show less overall profitability, which means lower business taxes; that, and job losses, depending on how things work out. But no, the legislature didn’t absorb these arguments. Maryland raised the sales tax level for gold, and the future will unfold in its own way. Wait and see. In Maryland the government wants your money, and will do what it can to get your money. Yes, sure; that’s the case most everywhere, but very few other states tax gold sales. And even if the tax receipts don’t roll into Annapolis because the original scheme was kind of dumb to begin with, the collective political entity doesn’t particularly care. Perhaps you think that this news item doesn’t matter much because you don’t live in Maryland, nor buy gold there. And even if you live in Maryland, you’re more than willing to drive across the line to another state to buy your gold with no sales tax. Yes, fair enough… Then again, it’s no stretch to think that we may already be in the early innings of a dangerous political idea; namely, that governments everywhere – not just Maryland – are desperate for revenue, and they’re moving to tax gold sales, if not gold holdings. Because, to borrow a line from the old bank robber Willie Sutton, “That’s where the money is.” Clearly, in recent years the price of gold has moved up sharply. Just think back not-too-many years, to a time of gold at $1,250 per ounce, or $1,750 per ounce, or $2,250 per ounce. Indeed, for that last price, think back just a little over a year. By comparison, the current price of gold is north of $3,300 and rising. There’s little downside, and big blue sky above. Here at Paradigm Press, our own Jim Rickards believes that gold prices will climb up and over $4,000 per ounce by the end of the year, meaning within the next six months. Plus, until quite recently and at the retail level (at least in the U.S.), only quirky gold bugs bought gold. Owning a stash was more of a curiosity than a financial norm. But now, and for many reasons, more people are literally buying gold; even Costco sells it, and the giant, consumer-facing, mass-retail chain can’t keep it in stock. Any way you look at it, these cumulative gold sales involve growing numbers of people and represent a lot of money, which tends to attract politicians and tax collectors. Of course, there’s more to the gold story than coin shops and/or Costco. And for all the media coverage of gold, it appears that most American politicians really don’t get the monetary angle. They lack sufficient education and perspective on money even to process what’s happening with dollars and by extension with gold. That is, at numerous levels America’s government doesn’t understand its own money. In previous articles I’ve discussed how the price of gold is NOT moving higher because armies of retail buyers are mobbing the coin shops of America. No, gold has moved higher in price because central banks across the world (well, central banks outside of America) are buying metal by the tonne. Think of Russia, China, India, and dozens of other nations; first, they are de-dollarizing, and second, seek the security of gold in the vaults versus the risk of U.S. Treasuries subject to the whims of American politics and politicians. Slowly but surely, the global monetary system is headed for a reset. It may not be next week or next month, but something is coming. Meanwhile the U.S. government, via out-of-control spending and expansive monetary policy, is ruining its own currency. And this brings us back to an old, sturdy piece of wisdom, that “Gold is money,” according to banker J.P, Morgan, who made the remark over 115 years ago. “Everything else is credit,” he added. J.P. Morgan, American banker. Wiki Commons. Indeed, Morgan was testifying before Congress about how he bailed out the U.S. government from a financial Panic in 1907-08, and at the time all American politicians understood what he meant. In that era, America and the world were on a gold standard, and it was a given that gold was the foundation of wealth. Today, we’re five generations post-Morgan. Very few people have an inherent understanding of the gold standard. Very few colleges or universities teach much of anything about gold, outside the geology department. And in the West in general, and the U.S. in particular, studying gold as money is an arcane idea, kind of like a branch of economic archaeology. Modern American culture has become fully dollarized and financialized, courtesy of the Federal Reserve and its notes, which are basically just entries in a ledger book or electronic equivalent. The term commonly used is “money creation” from the Fed, as if wealth can be generated by willing it into existence versus delivering some article or service of value. Ideally, the Fed should create dollars only in enough quantity to reflect the true growth in productivity and material wealth of the internal American economy, plus the value of imports. But in practice, the Fed has created far more dollars than America (or the world) has created wealth over the past century, which is why a current dollar is worth about 2-cents from, say, 1914. In these respects, it’s fair to say that the American governing class has little to no understanding of the meaning of money itself; the politicians are just counting the Niagara of dollars that flow through the economy, in so far as that can even be correctly measured. And they’re grabbing for dollars in any tax scheme they can conjure up. I’ll wrap up by returning to the story of Maryland and its new tax on gold. The state wants to collect sales tax when people exchange fiat-money dollars for real-money gold. In essence, it’s a penalty on foresighted people who see problems ahead and want to exit the dollar system for the hard-money comfort and security of gold. Yes, sure; Maryland needs the money to fund the dreams of its silly politicians. But no, this doesn’t mean that you must play the game. Get your gold, put it away somewhere safe, don’t discuss it, and preserve your wealth until our cultural craziness plays out. That’s all for now. Thank you for subscribing and reading.

Business FILE PHOTO: People walk outside the Nasdaq Marketsite in New York City, U.S., April 3, 2025. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo ReserveOne, a new crypto venture with ties to industry veterans and a former U.S. commerce secretary, will list on the Nasdaq through a merger with blank-check firm M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp and is expected to raise more than $1 billion. The company will manage a portfolio of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ethereum and Solana, while aligning its holdings with the U.S. strategic crypto reserve, it said on Tuesday. The deal, expected to close in the October-December quarter, is the latest in a series of efforts to wrap crypto assets into equity and make them more appealing for traditional investors. The exponential stock price growth of Michael Saylor's Strategy, which pivoted to a bitcoin-focused business model in 2020, has also popularized the playbook.

July 08, 2025 08:48 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Rumors are swirling that Jeff Bezos might acquire Condé Nast, Vogue's parent company, as a wedding gift for Lauren Sanchez. This speculation is fueled by Sanchez's recent Vogue cover, hand-picked attire by Anna Wintour, and Wintour's departure as Editor-in-Chief. Insiders suggest Wintour may be brokering the deal, potentially benefiting from her equity in the company, despite denials from Bezos's camp.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, yet another extra special guest. Wow. What a fascinating career. Kate Moore is having. Her background is everything from Morgan Stanley to more capital to Bank America, Merrill Lynch to JP Morgan to BlackRock. She’s now Chief Investment officer of Citibank’s Citi Wealth, which runs, you know, something like a trillion dollars. The breadth and depth of her experience makes her uniquely situated to be a chief investment officer. She’s had, you know, just about every job on the buy side and sell side, including portfolio manager, consultant to LBOs and m and as she’s just done so much stuff, it’s so interesting that she really brings just this unique set of experiences to Citi. I thought this conversation was really interesting and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Kate Moore. Kate Moore: Thanks so much, Barry. I’m psyched to be having this conversation today Barry Ritholtz: Long overdue. Yeah, we’ve, we’ve been like ships in the night. I, I’m so glad I finally got, got you here. Let’s start a little bit with your academic background. Yeah. Which is kind of surprised me. Bachelor’s in political and social thought from the University of Virginia, a Master’s in Political Economy from University of Chicago. What was the original career plan? Kate Moore: I mean, I think Barry underlying your question was like, Kate, you sound kind of nerdy but not as nerdy as some of the folks who have like triple degrees in statistics. But so where did this political and social thought and political economy stuff come from? So at University of Virginia, this PST program is interdisciplinary and that was really attractive. You also apply during your second year so you have a chance to like send it, cut a sample, some different disciplines before you do it. And it’s an incredible seminar program. So you’re working with some really amazing professors throughout the way. I loved being able to take classes in economics, in politics, in theory, in philosophy. I also took a lot of studio art classes and stuff as an undergrad, but I was able to combine all of this stuff together. So I loved that. And then I worked for a couple years and I decided, you know, hey, what I really am good at and what I love is academics and I wanna be a professor. This was my, my idea. I’m gonna go back to school and get my PhD and be a professor. I had this whole vision for myself that involved like, you know, writing books in the summer I would be doing cool research. I have a pack of golden retrievers and you know, I’d like rock climb on the side. This is whole vision of my academic life. So I applied to PhD programs and I went to University of Chicago for political economy. So this intersection of policy and politics, you know, international theory and you know, economics. And I found once I was there, honestly, that many people in my program are taking eight to 10 years to get through their PhD and becoming so specialized in very arcane topics. And it was like not appealing to me since I had already worked and everything. So I left after my master’s, but I did my work on, you know, this intersection of economics and policy with a focus on emerging markets and China. So I was ahead of my time. Barry Ritholtz: It’s so interesting that you talk about how specialized some people become. It’s pretty clear, at least historically, many of the greatest investors in history had a very broad set of interest and a broad set of skills. Few of them were an inch wide and a mile deep. They weren’t a mile wide and an inch deep, but they were broad enough that they were able to pull in things from other fields that applied to investing. Did you find something similar when you’re studying political science and economics to, how did that shape your investing philosophy? Kate Moore: Absolutely. I think, you know, the best macro investors or able to pull in, you know, different inputs from policy and politics, it’s also really helpful I think to understand human behavior. So if you’re taking an interdisciplinary approach to your academics and your investing life, I think you’re well set up. So in this, I mean I took a bunch of courses on game theory and stuff as a, in my graduate work and understanding payoffs and incentives, doing some work on behavioral economics, all of that combines really well. And my experience too was that the best investors that I worked for over the course of my career also took in all of these different inputs and we’re constantly trying to solve a puzzle, right? It wasn’t just, you know, a two variable puzzle. It was a multi-variable puzzle understanding that every day you wake up and you have to do it anew. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, no, no doubt about it. It’s so funny you mention incentives. Whenever I see a situation that I find completely perplexing and can’t figure it out, what usually leads to the answer is what, what are the incentives that led to this situation? I want you to work backwards from that. So let’s talk a little bit about the strategy and consulting side. You begin your career, Mitchell, Madison and Silver Oak Partners, is that right? Yes. Those two shops. Tell us a little bit about what you did for them and the sort of work and problem solving you did for those firms. Okay, 00:05:34 [Speaker Changed] So both Mitchell Madison, silver Oak no longer exist, right? For the record, Mitchell Madison was formed out of a spinoff of a bunch of McKinsey partners and it was taking kind of a new way, a new approach frankly, to some of the similar types of clients as McKinsey had. And, but it had this very entrepreneurial kind of environment because it was a break off, but it was still really large and global. I did a bunch of like strategy consulting projects, things you would expect, including some cool stuff in the media space just at the time where the internet was becoming popular. And some of these websites like Amazon that we take for granted were getting launched. So I learned a lot about media and e-commerce in those early stages at Mitchell Madison, but Mitchell Madison, for those of you who may recognize it, went through a merger with us Web CKS, which was a technology consulting firm. 00:06:33 All the combined entity got rebranded as March 1st, which was the date that the deal was inked. Kind of a weird marketing decision on that part, but you know, the, the, the business started to change and a number of the partners like broke off and started Silver Oak, which focused on leverage buyout firms. Now here is what was really cool. I wasn’t doing work for let’s say the LBO in master form, but rather like a collection of the companies in the portfolio at the same time trying to find synergies. There were things that are traditional around sourcing, but things that were maybe less traditional around finding strategic combinations. And I had a great opportunity to get exposed to a lot of different industries, you know, from traditional manufacturers to telecom companies, financial services and everything in between. And I have to say, Barry, that experience, you know, working for these kind of small and mid-sized LBO owned companies really set me up well for understanding and investing in a broad array of equities. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the investing side. Your next stop is Morgan Stanley, obviously a legendary and giant sell side firm. Tell us your, about your experiences at Morgan Stanley. Yeah, Kate Moore: So how I got to Morgan Stanley investment management is perhaps kind of interesting. So we were just talking about my academic background and I was doing this, you know, political economy degree at University of Chicago and I had had this sort of moment where I realized I wasn’t gonna pursue the PhD. So I, you know, made an appointment with my advisor and I said, you know, professor Harold, I’m not sure I wanna do the PhD. And he starts laughing and we’re sitting in his office, he said, Kate, I’ve been waiting for this conversation for six months. Oh completely. Wow. I said, oh my gosh. Like do you know, do you think I’m screwing up here? He said, no, you’re top of the class. What I do recognize though is because you’ve worked before for a number of years before coming into a PhD program, you have a different skillset and you’re approaching this differently. He’s like, I think you can finish your PhD later. You know, do the master’s and whatever. So I had this in my mind and I, so I started to put out a couple feelers, but I wasn’t really committed to what I would do post, you know, getting my master’s degree. Barry Ritholtz:And this is out of Chicago, rght? 00:08:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s in Chicago. And then a strange thing happened, I was back on the east coast visiting my parents and I got a call from the career services people at University of Chicago. I was still, you know, enrolled in school there just getting my thesis graded. And they said, Hey, we got an incoming call from the Chief Investment officer of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. This guy’s name is Joe McLinden. Joe is looking to add to his macro investing team on the buy side and specifically is looking for candidates that are not MBAs. He wanted people who had this understanding of politics and economics and everything in between. And I said, Hey guys, I’m not interested in going back into that form of finance. I’m gonna do something different. They said, do us this favor and go on the interview. Barry Ritholtz: Just like, just just meet with them. Yeah. 00:09:35 [Speaker Changed] Like let’s put up a good candidate. You kind of meet the criteria. If it’s not your bag, it’s not your bag. And I went and met this team at Morgan Stanley investment management and people who had economics and history and philosophy degrees, but were macro investors. And I was like, okay, A, these people are cool and b, I love how they’re solving the problems. Two weeks later I accepted an offer. I fell into investing Barry. Barry Ritholtz: Wow, that’s that’s really fascinating. And, and you’ve had a breadth of experiences beyond Morgan Stanley. You were at more Capital well regarded hedge funds, bank of America, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, you spent a lot of time at BlackRock. Tell us what was fun, what did you learn at these other shops? Kate Moore: So I’ve had a really cool career in the sense that I’ve done, you know, a variety of different buy-side, more traditional mutual funds. But even when I was at s Im, we launched the first internal hedge fund. This is before Morgan Stanley bought Front Point and I worked at a big macro hedge fund through the financial crisis, as you mentioned, at more capital that was an adventure. I did a few years on the sell side at B of a Merrill as global equity and emerging market strategist. And then I went to JP Morgan, managed the discretionary multi-asset portfolios for the private bank. Then I spent a, a long time at BlackRock, most of it as a portfolio manager for global allocation, kind of the flagship multi-asset fund. I have to say I love the fact that I have experienced all sides of the investing business and it makes me understand what makes investors tick a lot more than people who just stayed in their lane. Like I get the retail side, the institutional side, what fast money does, what traders do, what fundamental investors do. And I interpret all this sort of sentiment and flow data as part of my process as a result of having this exposure to different parts of the investment management business. Barry Ritholtz: Sounds really, really interesting. So from all of these different backgrounds, what finally brought you to Citi? Kate Moore: Yeah, so I, I was at a bit of an interesting inflection point I would say in my career here I am. I’ve loved being at BlackRock, I really enjoyed the work, but I also recognized I was kind of ready to take the next big step and I could continue to be a portfolio manager at BlackRock and it’s an amazing firm, but I was kind of wondering what it would sort of, what what I should do to take this next step. And I looked around and said where are the areas of growth in the business? And traditional mutual funds we know are not a huge growth area for the business. Even if your performance is exceptional, you know, keeping your assets can be a challenge. And I saw wealth as an area of consistent growth. I think most people would agree on that front for sure. 00:12:22 And, and you know, there’s some growth in alternatives, but it felt like just a different flavor of the stuff I was doing. So I was sort of intrigued by this idea of, of working in wealth, especially because I’ve done a lot of asset allocation and the multi-asset discipline I come from and I love the challenge of helping people grow their money over time. But I hadn’t, I didn’t have like a great idea in my head of what I was gonna do. This was just sort of something that was a seed that was planted and not yet out of the soil if it were. Hmm. And in August of 2024, Andy Seig, who I’d known in the business for like 15 years or so, never worked together directly. But you know, we’d met a number of times, been on panels together, had good cordial relationship. He called me and said, Kate, I have an idea for you. And he had been at Citi for a year then as you know, CEO of wealth. And I thought, okay, this is interesting, but I need to turn it over in my head a little bit. Is this gonna be the right pivot? And ultimately I got so excited Barry because Citi was already in this massive transformation. Andy is a really inspirational leader. I’m not just saying that ’cause he’s my boss, but I think most people on the street will agree. He has a vision he executes and this was a new challenge for me. I’d be flexing different muscles and I thought to myself, for this next big push in my career, I wanna be someplace where I can be entrepreneurial, where I’m gonna be supported by the overall platform where, you know, I can continue to grow out my experience as an investor. And so ultimately I made the tough decision to leave a firm that I loved for a new and exciting challenge. Barry Ritholtz: Safe to say that this shift in career was the biggest inflection point. Kate Moore: It feels like it’s the biggest inflection point in my career, but it also feels cumulative. I don’t know if that makes sense, but perfect sense Barry Ritholtz: I understand exactly what you’re saying. All all of these different elements come together almost like a perfect storm. Yeah. And suddenly now we’re off to the, to the whole nother level. Kate Moore: Yeah. I’ve been building up these experiences over the course of my career and kind of setting me up to take on this new challenge. It does feel the largest in part because I’ve been so concentrated on being an investor over the course of my career. And this is a combination of strategy and, and business leadership and investing. And so as I said, I’m flexing, flexing a bunch of different muscles. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s put some numbers, some flesh on the bone. So the groups you lead the wealth group at at Citi, what’s the assets they’re investing and typically who are the clients? Are they mom and pop investors? Are they institutional? A little of both. Kate Moore: Yeah. So I’ll give you some numbers as of end of 2024 because everything else, of course is in flux in the first part. Barry Ritholtz: We know how that works. Kate Moore: Yeah. I’m in, in the middle of studying for series 65, what will be like my 39th millionth of Barry Ritholtz: But that one you could do in your sleep. It’s not like the seven, which is or the options. Yeah. I forgot which one was the options. That was a giant like wait, I need to learn about gamma, why not? Kate Moore: Totally. I’ve taken the options one too. What I will tell you is the one thing that’s a little bit annoying on the economic section of the series 65 is that, you know, I don’t always agree. Barry Ritholtz: Was gonna say the answers are wrong answer. Once you get past that, the test is really easy. Kate Moore: For Example, it was like, you know, our payrolls a leading lagging or coincident indicator. Very, of course Barry Ritholtz: It’s lagging! Of course or anything but lagging because it’s two months old. Kate Moore: Totally. And like plus or minus 100 Barry Ritholtz: They, they said coincidental, right? Totally. Yeah. It’s just there. I, I remember having an, this is by the way, 30 something years ago, 20 something years ago. I remember calling up and yelling at somebody like, just so you know, I didn’t get any of these answers wrong. And the three you marked wrong, you are wrong. And let me explain why totally. How, how can payrolls, which are a model that uses 1, 2, 3 month old data be anything other than a Kate Moore: Lagging and that get totally restated every two years. Right. And the, the error bands, but the subsequent monthly revisions, I mean by the time you get to the actual number, it’s like half a decade old. It’s nonsense Barry Ritholtz: a hundred percent. Kate Moore: We have to pretend.And yet of course the market moves a lot on payrolls stay and we have to pretend that matters in the moment. Yeah, we have to pretend. Okay, where were we going before? Barry Ritholtz: I have no idea. But I just love the fact that you’re studying for the 65. I know studying in air quotes, Kate Moore: I get to whiz through the equity and hedge fund and everything sort of sections of it. But I have to memorize their answers for economics. Barry Ritholtz: If it, if it wasn’t embarrassing to fail, yeah. I would say you can wing it and you’ll do just fine. I think 70 is a passing, you’ll get like 80 just off the top of your head. But no one wants to go in and fail ’cause it’s embarrassing Kate Moore: No, I’m very like, I, I’ve made my career off of being a perfectionist, you know, in my analysis. That’s so funny. And you know, I do not accept a barely passing grade. I do not expect, I, I accept, you know, index like performance. I’m always seeking alpha and I’m doing my best to do that in the most risk adjusted way, even Barry Ritholtz:In an examination that’s pass fail. Yeah. And we know objectively, logically anything over a 71 is wasted effort. But yeah. But I know where exactly where you coming Kate Moore: From. I can’t sleep at night. I can’t sleep at night if it’s just good enough. And that’s also how I wanna approach things for my clients. Okay, we’re talking about Citi here. And so Citi has about a trillion do, Citi Wealth has a trillion dollars in assets close to like 600, you know, billion of that is in investments and there’s other parts in deposits and loans and things like that. And there are three main segments, right? There’s a traditional kind of private bank, ultra high net worth service, right? There’s Citi Gold, which is mass affluent, and then there is a wealth at work which targets like very specific segments like the law firm population, et cetera. Barry Ritholtz: Makes a lot, makes a ton of sense. Kate Moore: What I will say is Citi as a bank has so many global customers and clients and people with longstanding relationships that haven’t been tapped. You know, there’s, there is an enormous amount of potential to grow the wealth business just from existing Citi customers. And I think as you probably know, half of our business is outside of the US and it is a, it is a, Barry Ritholtz:Is it 50%? It’s fully half, yeah. Wow. That’s amazing. Yeah. Kate Moore: And the Asia business for us and particularly our legacy in China and surrounding areas is incredibly strong. And that was something that was also very attractive to me, to be honest with you. As someone who has been an, an emerging markets investor at times and a student of China, you know, the ability to get really deep into the opportunity to grow wealth in multiple different areas was exciting. 00:19:15 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really fascinating. So before we talk about Citi, let’s start a little bit with your time at BlackRock. You joined them almost a decade ago in 2016 you were chief equity strategist. Tell us a little bit about your initial role and how that played off of what you had been doing previously. 00:19:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so I joined BlackRock to be part of the BlackRock Investment Institute, which is kind of the internal macro think tank. And the institute has a couple of different functions. There is a segment that is client facing, but there’s also a big function around bringing together the investors across all the platforms in BlackRock and convening for, you know, forums and symposiums around specific topics. And although I was called Chief equity strategist, I actually sat on the equity platform with all the equity PMs and my job was to be basically embedded in all of the equity portfolios as the macro. My team was the macro resource for them and it was great. And you know, I always knew that I would do that for a little while. They basically said, can you do this and help to sort of change some of the equity culture and to have some macro inputs and then you can kind of figure out where you wanna sit. And ultimately, you know, moving back to a multi-asset fund made the most sense for me because here’s my joke, Barry, like I think of myself as being a macro equity investor, you know, combining macro stuff into equities, but the macro people will say, I’m equity and the equity people will say I’m macro. Yeah, that makes sense. So a multi-asset fund is a, is a good home for me. Huh? 00:20:50 [Speaker Changed] So 2019 you start working with the thematic strategy and portfolio manager group. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about thematics that’s become sort of an alternative to beta in a lot of shops. BlackRock especially. 00:21:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well let me say this, I actually started my career, you know, at Morgan Stanley investment management and the hedge fund that my team launched at MIM was a global thematic hedge fund. This is way back like over 23 years ago at this point. So we were ahead of our times, right? So I’ve actually had this thematic approach, frankly in my investment approach throughout my entire career. And it’s just now becoming really popular to call everything a thematic. So lemme say this, I think there are three ways at this time to approach thematics, three different flavors if you will. The first is this kind of like long duration slow bleed thematic. Like eventually we are going to have reduce the amount of plastics in all of our goods. And so we wanna lean into companies that are investing in that transition. You 00:22:01 [Speaker Changed] Don’t think microplastics accumulating in your lungs and bloodstream is a bad thing. 00:22:06 [Speaker Changed] It is definitely a bad thing. I wonder if I’m a little bit cooked when it comes to that already. But this is kind of a set it and forget it strategy, right? Where you identify companies that are making these changes or facilitating the changes and you buy a basket of them and you or an ETF that invests ’em and then you just set it. The second type of thematics is what I would call like discontinuous change, catalyst driven thematics. And these are more tactical, like, you know, it could be a couple quarters, it could be up to a year or two or even longer. But this is kind of a more actively managed way to approach thematics, right? Where, so you identify the idea, you identify the catalysts, you identify the players, and actually there’s more of a rotation in the names and the sizing of that expression in the thematic. That’s really exciting. It’s also hard because sometimes you look around and say, I don’t see a ton of catalysts here. There’s nothing really jumping out. You 00:23:02 [Speaker Changed] Gotta get the theme, right? The asset class, right? And the timing right 00:23:05 [Speaker Changed] And the sizing, you know, within that, right? And so that’s not like by 40 companies that are thinking about microplastics. It is like four to eight names, a more concentrated expression around a theme. You’re taking some idiosyncratic risk and you are continuing to to invest around that. And then the third type of thematic investing, I would say is really business cycle thematic. And a lot of people talk about this, you know, today there’s a, you know, where are we in the cycle? What are the companies sectors or qualities that perform well in that part of the cycle? I’m thematically investing in inflation beneficiaries, et cetera. And I’ve always liked to do those two, kind of number two and number three together, which is the catalyst driven and the business cycle. And I think that together makes a nice portfolio. 00:23:54 [Speaker Changed] You know, I recall back in the day when we were talking about sort of thematic cycle investing, business cycle investing, it was used to go by the name sector rotation. Yeah. I don’t know if anybody still does that sort of stuff anymore, it 00:24:09 [Speaker Changed] Seems like, or the investment clock. Do you remember the investment clock? Sure, sure. Absolutely. Everyone had an investment clock, which was like this two dimensional representation of which sectors or which maybe style factors. Once that became part of our lexicon performed well in different macro environments, 00:24:26 [Speaker Changed] It was always sort of a sine wave. And here’s where we are in this sector here in the sector there. Yeah. If it only were, were that easy. 00:24:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, I, I won’t call out names, but I know some folks that like to chart where we are, which quadrant we’re in, right. You know, on a regular basis. And instead of this nice round circle or an oval, you know, it’s very sort of spastic point to point, to point to point because the macro data is moving so quickly and the positioning data, which also indicates, you know, investor risk, appetite changes so rapidly that we jump from one quadrant to the other sometimes month to month. 00:25:05 [Speaker Changed] So, so you mentioned removing plastic from the food supply or wherever. Yeah. What other trends have you looked at? Deglobalization, decarbonization ai. What gets you excited these days? 00:25:18 [Speaker Changed] Oh wait, you just said a hot button word for me, which is deglobalization. And let me just say I don’t believe in deglobalization. 00:25:24 [Speaker Changed] I’m with you, but I want to hear your reasons why. 00:25:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I don’t believe in deglobalization because even if, let’s say hypothetically the US and China continue to separate and by hypothetical I was making a joke for all the listeners, of course the US and China are gonna continue to separate. That doesn’t mean the relationships between each of these countries and other trading partners or allies is not gonna deepen, right? Maybe we call it re globalization instead of de-globalization, but a, a shifting of some other relationships. But I have spent a lot of my time, like a lot of folks frankly, looking at themes in and around technology. I mentioned the microplastics. It’s actually not a theme I’ve invested in. The only couple companies I’ve really seen who are geared towards that are private. And so it’s harder to access. But around technology, you know, a few areas I’ve been pretty excited about for a good considerable amount of time has been, you know, have been in, in software. 00:26:20 And one of those areas is cybersecurity. This was a major theme for me in the portfolio at Global allocation at BlackRock. And basically every time I was thinking that I’d want to either shift out of the theme or reduce it, there was another event on the horizon or something happening that led to increased spend in this space. I’ve now come to believe that investment in, in security software is existential for companies, right? And while there’s room to rotate, you know, names based on capabilities, et cetera, I believe it’s a, it’s a core part of a portfolio 00:26:54 [Speaker Changed] Longstanding secular trend that’s gonna be ongoing. 00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But I first put on this investment in January of 2020 Okay. When I was at BlackRock and that was before the pandemic and it was basically based on geopolitical risk and of course the pandemic that increased the risk from all this data for many different companies. So we saw big up uptick in spends. As I said, it was a, it’s been a rolling series of catalysts over the last five and a half years and makes it more of a secular theme than a, a shorter term catalyst driven theme. So. 00:27:25 [Speaker Changed] So let’s drill down a little bit to your core investment philosophy. You’ve mentioned thematics, you’ve mentioned pursuing Alpha. Tell us what is Kate Moore’s investment philosophy? 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it’s really important to have three pillars to your decision making and one pillar that’s off to the side that’s controversial. So I think you have to start with a macro view. I think you need to understand politics policy, the major economic data you need to understand government behaviors. ’cause so much of that dictates the environment for different industries. And some people just sort of brush it off. By the way, I love my equity colleagues and friends, but nothing makes the hair on the back of my neck go up more and kind of me bristle than to hear. I don’t pay attention to macro because I just pick good companies. Well good, you’ll be out of business. You don’t have a choice in this environment. You can’t set it and forget it for the next three years and not focus on what’s happening in the business cycle and policy and how that may impact the interest and desire to own your asset class. 00:28:29 So I think macro is critical and a good starting point. I also like to get into the fundamentals of things, right? Like where are the fundamental thematically, like who’s growing, what technology has come out, where do we think about, you know, changes in consumer behavior, changes in supply chains, and where are the real kind of fundamental opportunities? What are the companies doing? Well I think that’s not controversial either, but with the third stage, and it’s really important to me, I mean it’s grown in importance over the course of my career is the positioning, sentiment and technicals. And this has become really, really, really important for your, for defining your entry and exit points, even if you are a long-term investor because the markets move really quickly and you need to be really thoughtful about how you enter and exit. So I pay attention to flows, hedge fund, mutual fund positioning, introduction of new instruments, you know, a million things we kind of look at at our dashboard. And then this is the one I was saying the pillar off to the side valuation is a nice to know, but it is not a driving force of my investment process. And people might kind of cringe when I say that, you 00:29:40 [Speaker Changed] Know, know what, let me jump in here and, and I won’t explore that ’cause I don’t disagree with any of that. People kind of forget that bull markets that run 10, 20 years, valuations tend to start on the lower end and they tend to end on the higher end. But if you decide, oh, we’re above the average valuation of the past cycle, you’re missing a lot of upside, aren’t you? 00:30:06 [Speaker Changed] Ton of upside. Well there’s also this assumption that that underpins this view on valuations. That there is some sort of mean reversion, right? 00:30:13 [Speaker Changed] Tomorrow we’re gonna snap at, look at the cape is my favorite example of that. Yeah, the Schiller cyclically adjusted PE ratio. You would’ve been out like 90% since 1990. A hundred. Yeah. If you followed that, it’s, it’s kind of wild. 00:30:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, for sure. You would absolutely have not taken advantage of an incredible run in equities. Like, just to make this point and underscore it, I say evaluation is a starting point for your investment decision, what you’re screening for and entry and exit points. You would never own US tech and you would be long Russia, you know, and anyone who wants to take that trade, God bless, but you’ll be out of business, right? 00:30:50 [Speaker Changed] Russia’s been cheap, but some stocks are cheap for a reason. 00:30:54 [Speaker Changed] They are European banks cheap for reason. And we know that kind of over the medium term, this I’ll define as kind of three years, you know, stocks can stay quote unquote expensive or the way I like to say it be valued at a higher end of the market range because they are superior businesses and they can stay at those levels for multiple years, sometimes much longer and continue to rerate and stuff can look like it’s a discount to the rest of the market, but be structurally impaired and therefore deserve the discount. The other problem I have when people do these kind of like mean reversion, you know, valuation trades as they say like, oh we need to go back to some historical period where s and p was at 14 times, right? Why? I mean the market composition from a sector perspective completely different. The balance sheets of these companies completely different. The cash profiles and free cash generation of these companies completely different. The regulatory environment, the politics, the behavior, the market technicals, I can go on and on and on. It is literally the laziest piece of analysis I have ever seen. 00:32:04 [Speaker Changed] When when you look at last century companies like US Steel or even General Motors, you know, the expression was men in material, they need tons of capital giant factories today, two people with a laptop and Amazon web servers. You could, you could do as much business as any startup from any decade previously. 00:32:27 [Speaker Changed] Totally. I mean another example I like to use, like near and dear to our hearts in terms of the investment landscape is, you know, how many analysts do I really need to cover all different sorts of sectors? You know? And it, there was a time where I needed everyone to be an expert in a different industry or a different sector and to be very siloed and and deeply specialized. But right now I can be in a meeting sitting across the table from A CEO or CFO and they may be talking about a business that I only know 50% about, right? And I, in real time, I can use my AI tools, I can pull up what their competitors have said in recent earnings calls or you know, in the social media, I can look up terminology, I can pull up data. I am a hundred times more informed. I don’t need to be briefed for three hours from an analyst before I walk into that meeting. You know, just by understanding the types of questions to ask and having this data at my fingertips, I’m a faster and better investor. 00:33:25 [Speaker Changed] So here’s the challenge, and we could talk about AI as a theme in a little bit, but the challenge is you’ve gone through that whole process over the past 10, 20 years where you’ve, you know, done the reps put in the heavy lifting. Yeah. How is the next generation going to become the Kate Moore in 25 years if they don’t get to go through that process? And AI seems to, the phrase I heard recently was removing the bottom rung on the career ladder. Is this, is this a genuine concern? 00:33:59 [Speaker Changed] It is somewhat of a concern and I think it’s more of a concern for, for kids who are going through school and are incredibly specialized about what they’re studying. And this is kind of a flag frankly, I would say to people, you don’t wanna just take courses in one discipline. Your job as an undergrad. And I would also argue even in grad school, even in MBA program, is to learn how to think and learn how to ask questions to get exposed to as many different disciplines as possible. So I tell like young folks, like you gotta study philosophy, you should also study things like art history because there’s context behind it. You should study things like you know, hard sciences because you know, it gives you a discipline in terms of the way that you’re thinking you should take a music theory class. I mean do all of this. You want your brain to be flexible and compliant. You want to be able to approach the problem by using these tools in unique ways. And people who are only point and shoot, only have one specific way of approaching an investment problem are often wrong. 00:35:04 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really, really interesting. So you were brought to Citi specifically to focus on the wealth business there. What’s your strategy for breathing life into that space? 00:35:18 [Speaker Changed] So I think there are a couple things. We have a lot of amazing raw material at at Citi in terms of human capital and of course our clients. But thinking about how to invest in a different way than perhaps my other wealth competitors invest is, is one of the greatest challenges and opportunities. And here’s what I will say, you know, I want to examine the way that we’re approaching discretionary multi-asset class asset allocation products, right? Just to sort of set it and forget it. Here’s your stock bonds cash, I’m not sure is gonna be the right path moving forward. I mean, we want to think about what is the right combination of both asset class and factor exposures for, for clients in different risk profiles and how do we implement in, in an interesting way in that space. So it’s not just like, hey we have a, you know, large cap stock fund or, and we have a, you know, mid, mid duration bond fund and this is what we’re kind kind of combining together. This is really about, you know, what are the best expressions of each of those things? How much of it should be beta? How much of it should be alpha seeking? Whether it’s you know, sector specific or thematic. What is the best implementation in alternatives? And particularly as we get more liquid alternatives available, you know, that sort of diversification in a portfolio is going to be kind of democratized and we’re gonna see more and more of our clients across risk spectrum be able to access that. So, 00:36:51 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about the opportunities in the wealth business. What’s driving the growth here? Is it just the amount of capital that’s sloshing around? How big are demographics, the move towards alternatives? There’s so many different cross currents going on that make that space so attractive. What do you see as the key drivers? 00:37:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, there’s a bunch of different drivers, Barry. I’d say, you know, first of all there’s been an enormous amount of wealth created. We know over the last, you know, 10 years, it’s longer than that. But let’s just say in the last 10 years 00:37:23 [Speaker Changed] Post-financial crisis. 00:37:24 [Speaker Changed] Post-financial crisis, great 15 00:37:25 [Speaker Changed] Year run. 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And big concentrations of wealth and frankly a lot of very wealthy families have held a lot of these, this wealth in cash, you know, or in cash equivalents or have reinvested in their business. I think there’s now an understanding that they wanna diversify. So the investment opportunity set for all this wealth creation is huge. I’d say there’s another trend, and I’m sure people have talked about this before with you, which is like the transfer of wealth that’s gonna happen from the b the boomer generation to my generation, and then ultimately to our, you know, younger generation. And the values and the interests on the investing side change from generation to generation. You know, the types of risk clients wanna take, the types of like bespoke opportunities and private stuff that they wanna do. Maybe it’s around, you know, environmental social governance stuff. Maybe it’s around specific geographies, mission aligned. I mean I think that the flavor of investing is changing, which also makes us super exciting. And then finally I would say can, you know, the, the breadth of investment instruments that are available to individual investors and into wealthy families is actually really exciting because you can do cooler things than just a 60 40 portfolio, which was kind of the way wealth businesses ran in the past. 00:38:46 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. So you had mentioned the role of behavioral finance in some of your education and background. You were at University of Chicago, which has become a hotbed of behavioral finance. Dick Thaler. Yeah. He’s recipient of the Nobel. Tell us how you think about behavioral economics in your day job. How do you help clients steer through some of this year as a perfect example, a lot of volatility, a lot of sterman, drang, and here we are above where we were before liberation day. How do you guide people through that? 00:39:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, this is such a tough one, Barry, because you know, this is where understanding kind of the positioning, the technicals and the biases really differentiate a good investor from maybe a less good investor. One of the things I try and pay close attention to are all of these sentiment indicators and like, you know, the dashboard for sentiment indicators continues to change, right? Sometimes we look at, you know, historic filings, but we know that mutual funds and hedge funds change their positions really quickly. Sometimes we look at the volume and the flow. I like to pay attention to more kind of third party and, you know, coincident things like what, what’s being discussed in different social media or on different message boards or whatever. And to just try and understand what’s capturing the attention and energy from different client segments. But I also pay really close attention to frankly, how the market responds to different types of news. And that gives you a good sense. You gotta have your finger on that pulse. You know, I, I learned this from someone named Ben Hunt, who you may be familiar with. Of course, 00:40:32 [Speaker Changed] You’re right. Epsilon theory. 00:40:33 [Speaker Changed] Epsilon theory. So I learned this from Ben years ago, but he said, you know, number one, the first order to getting things right is like having a good forecast, right? Let’s just say you have a forecast for stock earnings. The second order is to understand what consensus thinks, right? And comparing your number against that, right? But to get it really right in the market, you need to understand what consensus thinks. Consensus thinks 00:40:59 [Speaker Changed] It’s a Kane’s beauty contest. 00:41:02 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And, but, but kind of instilling that in my team is really important because it’s like, great, I’m so glad you think we’re gonna have $263 of s and p earnings this year. If consensus actually thinks it’s 2 67, we should know that too. But if the printed number is 2 67 but everyone’s just dragging their feet on cutting the numbers and they’re actually at 2 55, that makes a difference in terms of how people take risk and respond to different news. And so, you know, kind of, of putting all these pieces together, doing the work, understanding what like written or published consensus is and then getting all these kind of sentiment inputs to really evaluate what is the whisper real number versus what’s published. 00:41:46 [Speaker Changed] So let me push back slightly on sentiment ’cause I want to get your take on this. So my experience generally has been most day-to-day sentiment is kind of noisy and it really matters when it hits an extreme. At least that’s a trader’s perspective. But the thing I really wanna push back on has been the University of Michigan. Yeah. Consumer sentiment data, which over the past couple of years it’s been worse than the financial crisis, worse than the beginning of the pandemic, worse than the the 2001 September 11th attacks or the.com implosion worse than the 87 crash. How do we figure out what’s going on in sentiment where it seems to have just detached from consumer behavior, Hey, everything is terrible, but we’re going out and spending totally, 00:42:38 [Speaker Changed] We’re still going out to restaurants even though we think the world is ending, right? Yeah, no, you’re absolutely right. So any single sentiment indicator or survey needs to be discounted, right? We need to come combine all these things and look at it kind of on a moving average of a number of prints. Another one that kind of flagged for me was the conference board confidence, which hit the lowest levels from like September of 2011, you know, last month. And that was a crazy number, right? Because it, September of 2011, we had just gone through this debt fiasco. We were going to Operation Twist, you know, there was like 00:43:11 [Speaker Changed] Post flash crash, it had gotten even crazy. 00:43:14 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. So, you know, that, that seemed really disconnected from reality. So sometimes you have to discount all of these things, but your point is well taken. There has been a generalized sentiment deterioration. Another one I look at is the, what is now the Richmond Fed, but historically had been the Duke Fuqua CFO survey. And you’ve seen over the past couple years this massive decoupling between expectations for own company over the next six months where the CFOs are going, like things are pretty good actually. And expectations for the economy where they’re like, the economy’s in trouble. 00:43:46 [Speaker Changed] It’s so funny you bring that up ’cause well first I had Tom barking and not too long ago, but second, we see that everywhere my congressman’s okay, but the rest of Congress thinks totally my financial circumstances seem to be pretty good, but we think the economy is going lower. Like that exact sort of sentiment split. What do you imagine is driving people to think, Hey, things aren’t that bad for me, but everywhere else it stinks. 00:44:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, hmm, this is tough one, but I, I honestly think the news flow, how media portrays recent events, the echo chamber on social media, the fact that people are not getting a broad based view. Do you see all these, you know, traditional news programs now that are trying to dedicate one night a week or whatever the heck it is to the good news, right? They’re 00:44:36 [Speaker Changed] Is that true? That’s, 00:44:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s like, that’s funny. There’s a, there’s a, a local channel I’ve watched that it will do one good story after they’ve just reported a bunch of like murders and you know, everything for the previous 25 minutes. The last story is like, they’re trying to leave you on a positive note, huh? I’m mean like, okay, but the skew is definitely really negative. 00:44:55 [Speaker Changed] If it, if it bleeds it leads, that’s always been the news thing. Yeah. 00:44:58 [Speaker Changed] Really, really fascinating. But now people are consuming more of that 00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] And so I think, I think you’re definitely onto something. But 00:45:04 [Speaker Changed] So we, yeah, we do maybe need to z score the sentiment right now, let’s just put it that way. We, we have to adjust for this declining overall sentiment. But when I’m talking about sentiment, I also like, I’m trying to infer sentiment from price reactions to different news, right? And that might be a better gauge in some of these surveys where people can say, you know, the sky is falling but then just book a carnival cruise, right? Like, you know the, and you know, if a stock puts up pretty good numbers in terms of earnings but doesn’t beat by huge margin and falls 15%, you can tell that like people are at the edge, right? And so, you know, you have to kind of correct your own equity exposure for that type of behavior, huh. But your point’s well taken on you mish and on, you know, all of these other surveys, there’s been a generalized decline. We have to correct for that. 00:45:52 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. So let’s talk a little bit about today’s market environment. 2025 has been kind of a volatile wacky year. What, what’s your current macro view on the global economy? What’s going on in markets? The fed yield inflation, tariffs, it all seems to be kind of tumbling together at once. 00:46:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I have to say 2025 has been a tough year for anyone and it’s also been a tough year candidly for me to start a new job. I like to say that every time I start a new job there’s some big volatility event. This one might be the biggest and frankly totally self-induced as opposed to some kind of exogenous or external shock. So it’s been really difficult to navigate through this market and yet, you know, there are some things we can still anchor to paying attention to what companies are saying about their businesses. This kind of sort of sentiment stuff we were talking about a moment ago. Looking at the long-term trends, this all leads us to say like okay, we can still be invested. But I am deeply worried Barry about what’s gonna happen to the economy over the summer and and into the beginning of 2026. 00:47:05 We know that companies have been operating more or less BAU business as usual despite all of the shocks on headlines around tariffs and consumers, you know, may have pulled forward some demand, but they’re also kind of operating BAU for the most part. There’s not been a significant change. And yet we know that the introduction of these tariffs and the risk aversion that’s a result of these tariffs and changes in policy and changes in expectations for global supply chains is going to lead to some weakness and activity. The thing I just wanna point out is like going into the end of 2024, in the beginning of 25, I was also like a little worried frankly that the economy was slowing not catastrophically, not recession style, but there were enough cracks across the consumer and enough indications from companies to basically suggest like this was not gonna be an accelerating year even before these policy shocks. 00:48:01 And now I think despite some adjustments, you know, immediately after the tariff announcements, companies don’t have an incentive to do a bunch of different things. And that is engage in real CapEx, they’ll spend what they need to to stay in business or to maintain or things that are absolutely necessary, but they’re gonna prioritize expansionary CapEx and acquisitions I think are off the table. Number two on the labor market. We’ve heard a lot of people talk about it being frozen. Yes there’s still some hiring, but when you look at kind of the composition of the hiring, it’s not as exciting as it might have otherwise been in a, you know, policy, you risk free economy and I think companies have an incentive to kind of keep their labor force where it is without really expanding. ’cause they don’t know if that’s gonna make sense for margins and stuff going forward. 00:48:51 And then the third thing I would say is, you know, companies need to ask themselves what should my supply chain, what should my corporate relationships look like over the course of, you know, the next couple years? Because the truth of the matter is if they have to realign ’em, it will be a significant cost. It will take a ton of time and take a ton of energy. And yet if there might be a policy shift either at the midterms or under a new administration, the incentive to make these multi-year investments as low. So I get this sort of paralysis that’s playing out in terms of the market in, in terms of corporate behavior. And so I’m a little, I wouldn’t say worried about a recession, but concerned about much slower activity in the second half of the year. 00:49:35 [Speaker Changed] So that raises so many different issues. We keep hearing from CFOs, CEOs about the lack of clarity. If you don’t know what the policy’s gonna be, how do you relocate manufacturing plan a headquarter? How do you plan to do any sort of expansionary hiring? So I’m completely with you that hey, this seems to be this self-inflicted wound that’s preventing the economy from accelerating and yet despite all that the economy seems to be incredibly resilient and not taking too big of a hit from all of these on again off again tariffs. Does that just mean that this administration inherited a really robust economy? 00:50:23 [Speaker Changed] Yes, and I think there’s another element to it. I do think this administration, you know, inherited a resilient economy. One that was perhaps underappreciated over the last couple years because not everyone was feeling that resilience in the same way or wealth creation wasn’t as broad as some would’ve liked. Okay. But I think there’s another element to this too, and this goes a little bit into kind of corporate behavior and how investors react to corporate decisions. Which is, you know, if a company pulls back prematurely, let’s say they shed a bunch of workforce or they cut a lot of CapEx and they really hunker down for a bad economic environment and that doesn’t actually show up for multiple quarters and they la 00:51:08 [Speaker Changed] Kinda like the past few years. Yeah. Everybody forecasting recessions that never came 00:51:12 [Speaker Changed] And they lag their peer group and they look weak relative to the rest of the industry. Wow. That, that makes people lose confidence in that management team. Hmm. So there’s almost an incentive for management teams to maybe have contingency plans to talk about that with their board and the rest of their leadership, but not necessarily communicate that with the investment community and keep operating with only a tiny bit of defensive action because there’s gonna be a penalty on their stock price and frankly in the confidence people have in the management team, if it looks like they’re being too emotional and reactionary. 00:51:48 [Speaker Changed] This sounds like the game theory work you did at UFC Yeah is coming into the 00:51:52 [Speaker Changed] Before a a hundred percent that that it plays a huge part in the way I think about this. So you know, no company has an incentive to talk about how concerned they actually are publicly because the first one that does it will be penalized. 00:52:05 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That’s interesting. And, and since you work at a giant bank, we’ve seen bank earnings that are pretty strong across the board. Yeah. That’s kind of unexpected. Tell us a little bit about what does that mean in light of this environment? Relatively high rates really just more normalized than what we’ve seen in the prior two decades. What’s going on in the banking sector? 00:52:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, well I can talk a little bit about Citi because we’ve had some pretty awesome operating performance and there are a couple things really driving that. Of course, you know, there’s been a real focus in terms of cost and expense. This is not just Citi, this is across the board at major financial institutions and frankly investment investors really love this. They want to see that discipline continue. Number two, like the mix shift has actually contributed to earnings. And I think as you well know, you know, wealth has been a huge driver for many of the diversified financial services companies. I expect it con will continue and I’m looking forward to wealth being an even bigger driver for Citi over the next couple years. And then I think there’s a, you know, another element too, which is that the speed and sort of the, the facility that management has in toggling between different types of business for different parts of the cycle has significantly improved relative to how people think about banks 15 years ago. So we were talking about valuations earlier and you know, financial services and kind of banks more specifically kind of dragged down overall market multiples when they were a huge part of the market cap for the US large cap indices in the past. 00:53:39 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about soft data. It’s kind of been negative when we’re talking about sentiment and things like that. This really hasn’t translated into the hard data yet. Tell us what you’re looking at in that space. 00:53:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, of course. I mean, I’m shaking my head as you say that ’cause it’s absolutely right. The soft data into hard data in a normal period, you know, gets translated in in over inconsistent time period. So there’s not like a map that says like, hey, the soft data does x and then three quarters later or one month later it translates into something in the market or some other hard data and economic activity. So it’s always a bit of an art interpreting the soft data into the hard data. And yet it’s really important to, to pay attention because it may impact the marginal decision. Right now the soft data has went from catastrophic post the April 2nd to tariff announcements to really awful, to maybe a hair better, but still pretty bummed out. And as we’ve talked about, the economic data has stayed somewhat resilient. That doesn’t mean that the economic data will never show weakness. And again, I’m expecting some soft pockets throughout the second half of the year. Not recessionary, but kind of like sub 2% sub one point half percent growth. I think we should buckle down for, and that’s where I expect more durable earning stories. Secular growth stories will outperform the rest of the market. 00:55:06 [Speaker Changed] So it sounds like there are a couple of catalysts in the pipeline and you’re just waiting to see which direction the majority of these go. Tell us a little bit about what you see is upside and downsized. 00:55:18 [Speaker Changed] Catalysts. Okay. So around tariffs, any given day that we’d be having this discussion, there would be, there’s a new set of news. One thing I do know is that we have a series of deadlines over the course of the summer where people are hoping for some level of resolution. And the way I say talk about this, Barry, is this, is that we may be past peak tar of shock, but we are nowhere close to peak tariff pain. We don’t really know how bad it’s going to be quite yet. And this is why of course companies have been reluctant to significantly change their guidance and their earnings revision ratios have looked, you know, better than some people expected. Here’s what I will say. Even if the reciprocal tariffs don’t hold up and they end up going to the Supreme Court and that’s a decision, the sectoral tariffs which take longer to implement are much stickier and frankly have much long larger. 00:56:09 [Speaker Changed] When you say sectoral like North America Canon? 00:56:12 [Speaker Changed] No, like semis. 00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] Oh, okay. Gotcha. Pharma, 00:56:16 [Speaker Changed] Copper, steel, all of these sectoral tariffs are much stickier and have much greater potential impact than the country to country bilateral reciprocal tariffs. 00:56:28 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s so interesting you mentioned that someone was from a biomedical device company was having a conversation with me. It’s like I don’t understand an iPhone is exempt from China tariffs, but the pacemakers we make that save people’s lives are not, and if we have to relocate this to wherever, to Taiwan, to Vietnam, to Canada, right? The FDA process starts over and it’ll be eight years. So for about half a decade or so, as the the Chinese manufacturer at pacemakers sell off, but before the new ones come online, there’s not gonna be enough pacemakers 00:57:07 [Speaker Changed] Right there. We have a real risk of some of these important raw materials and these important consumer goods and these important medical goods, you know, not being adequately supplied. And so we have to really watch this. So I, so I will say this, that the tariff side is not gonna be resolved over the course of the summer and because it’s gonna bleed out for longer, we may have slower growth, but not catastrophic. But eventually we’ll have some really big sectoral consumer and business impacts. 00:57:36 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really interesting. You mentioned some of the news stories and how things are affecting sentiment. How do you see the role of narratives driving market responses? It seems like there are different stories for different asset classes every other week. 00:57:54 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. The narrative changes. It sometimes it feels like on 30 minute increments, it, you know, it used to be you’d have a couple weeks of a narrative taking hold. I know many people think about this, but the market can really only focus on one thing at a time, one major narrative at a time. You know, and that’s where you end up seeing the bulk of the price movement. For example, is it around tariffs? Is it around inflation data? Is it around fed expectations? Is it around the technology conflict between the US and China? Is it around some geopolitical shock? You know, it’s, but it’s not gonna be all of those things at once, even though I would argue all of those things are happening concurrently. And I think the market has become even more short attention span if we can, you know, personify it here. And as a result, the narratives are shifting very quickly. This is why it’s really important to, when you’re thinking about portfolio construction, to anchor on the right asset class and factor exposures, to layer it with more sort of medium term thematic alpha generating ideas and then offer some ballast to the portfolio, either in less correlated assets or in expressions of the asset class or factor that that has a different duration. So, 00:59:07 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about some of the quote unquote less correlated asset classes. There has been a giant move into alternatives, most especially private credit, private equity. What do you see in that space? How is that evolving over the next five to 10 years? 00:59:25 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, let me answer that second part first. I think the evolution of this, this broad bucket of alternatives is gonna be towards more liquid expressions. 00:59:34 [Speaker Changed] More liquid, yes. 00:59:36 [Speaker Changed] Or at least more vehicles that allow for individual investors and, you know, family offices and things like that to invest in these types of vehicles. Right? You don’t have to set it and forget it for like 10 years. I think there’s gonna be a lot of demand just as we’ve seen say traditional mutual fund transfer into ETFs, active ETFs, but be more kind of combined vehicles. The challenge I think is that there’s been so much money, and we know this, we’ve got great data on this chasing this like a small number of deals. And it has become so popular to think about alternatives as an asset class that the returns that some of these strategies have been able to achieve in the past, I think are much more challenged in the future. 01:00:21 [Speaker Changed] Ha Haven’t we seen that in sort of venture capital land? Absolutely. Back in the absolutely the eighties and nineties VC numbers were spectacular. And post.com implosion. Yeah. Not only you have more companies staying private for longer, it just seems like a ton of low hanging fruit were picked, you know, decades ago. Yeah. 01:00:39 [Speaker Changed] The narrative is like 85% of US companies are actually still private. And so it’s really important to have all these vehicles to access them on the equity on the credit side. I hear that. But there’s certain major differences. Of course, if you’re a private company, you may continue to need different types of funding. You don’t have to disclose to your shareholders on a regular basis, of course, that you don’t have to deal with the, the stock price fluctuation and, and all of that, what that might mean for your employees who are paid and, and shares. But it also creates a complicated environment where when you don’t have to disclose, when you don’t have to report, you know, you may make a different set of decisions. Some of that might be good for the long term and some of it may be just like a poor allocation of capital. ’cause no one’s calling you out on it because the capital’s already locked in. So it’s, I would say this 85% of companies that are still private, that the alternative managers are exciting about, about giving you exposure to not all of them are the same quality as the, you know, publicly available, you know, large cap, mega cap companies. 01:01:46 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense. I want to get to my favorite questions. Okay. But before I do that, I gotta throw you at least one curve ball. You are on the resource council for the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. Yeah. Tell us about that. Does 01:01:59 [Speaker Changed] That sound random to you, 01:02:00 [Speaker Changed] Barry? Yeah, it sounds totally ra I know you’re a former ski bum. I am. So maybe there’s some relationship with that. Yeah, I 01:02:08 [Speaker Changed] Actually split my time between New York City and Jackson Hole. So I spent a lot of time in the Jackson community. I’m super passionate about the conservation and nature programs at Grand Teton National Park. And I’ve been on the Resource council now for about three years. It is a kind of sub-board of the, of the board of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. And we do some really amazing things. One of the things I’m most passionate about are some of these wildlife programs and the money that we raise specifically for research that benefits some of the biologists in the park and also that, you know, all of the visitors to the park can take advantage of. My favorite thing to do every summer, Barry is the Wolf Watch, which we do some, some days during August, we’ll go up with a biologist to this bluff and we will watch a, a pack that lives in Grand Teton National Park and learn all about wolf habitats behaviors and changes in their patterns. 01:03:04 [Speaker Changed] So, so this is part of the National Park system, but yet there’s a private foundation that helps raise assets and manage resources for the park. Tell us a little bit about that 01:03:15 [Speaker Changed] Structure. Yeah, actually, almost all the national parks have friends groups. And this Grant Teton National Park Foundation is the friends group for Grand Teton National Park. We are a very large and successful one and we’ve really helped to partner with the park on everything from like visitor centers to, you know, accessible options to the, to rivers, to redoing the trail system, to sponsoring some of the biologists, et cetera. The park is run by the park, but the superintendent and the CEO Grant Teton National Park Foundation are close partners. And I like to think, yeah, we’re the best friends group out there. 01:03:47 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really quite fascinating. Let’s jump to our favorite questions ’cause I only, I know I only have you for a few more moments. We’ll, we’ll make this our speed round. Starting with what’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you watching or listening to? 01:04:03 [Speaker Changed] Okay, so I don’t watch television at all very infrequently. 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] No Netflix, no prime, no Apple tv, none of that. 01:04:10 [Speaker Changed] It’s not really my jam. Wow, 01:04:12 [Speaker Changed] That’s really 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] Interesting. Yeah, it’s not really my jam. I do watch like things, sometimes a news magazine or whatever, but for the most part I’m just an avid reader and I like to spend my time when I’m not working, reading, playing sports, listening to music, and I’m an amateur artist, so I’ve been watching screens after being in front of screens all day long is unappealing to me. 01:04:35 [Speaker Changed] Can I tell you that sounds shockingly healthy. 01:04:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I try to be shockingly healthy. I also try to put my devices down and be focused on other things because I get enough screen time during the day. 01:04:46 [Speaker Changed] I, I totally get it. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 01:04:52 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know that I had a lot of official mentors. I will tell you, I had more peer mentors, if that makes sense. You know, growing up in the business, I, I was often the only woman in the room, or the only woman on the investment committee. And I built really strong peer relationships with other investors of similar levels around the street. And there are a lot of people who’ve helped to influence my way of thinking or have challenged me. But yeah, I mean, I try and be a mentor to as many, especially young women as I can in the business since I didn’t have that available to me at the time. But I wish I had a long list of mentors, but I would say it’s, it’s more my peer group that I’ve really linked arms with and grown with that I think of as kind of playing that role for me in my career. 01:05:37 [Speaker Changed] Huh, interesting. So you mentioned you read a lot. Let’s talk about books. Yeah. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:05:44 [Speaker Changed] Okay. I’m a giant sci-fi in fantasy nerd. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] Oh boy. Were you talking to the right person? 01:05:49 [Speaker Changed] I mean, so on this theme of not watching screens after I work, I like to really escape, like deep in escape after a long day of staring at numbers and analyzing, you know, economics. So here’s what I will say. I am in an amazing series right now, the Murder Bot series by Martha Wells. I know it’s been made into a series. I will not watch it because it will ruin the entire vision. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] It’s on Apple tv. It’s gotten mixed reviews so far. Yeah, so far. But I have that in my queue, the first murder box. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it’s so good. It’s amazing. And you know, thinking about this intersection between bots and AI and the future, and there’s a lot of inner dialogue in there that I don’t think will translate well into a series. But anyway, neither here nor there. So I love to read that before I, I’m on book six now. Before I started that I read the latest from Town of French, which is called the Searcher and, and that and the Hunters two books together, it takes place in Ireland. She’s one of my favorite contemporary fiction authors. It’s like, these are mysteries. And so I love that. And yeah, I pretty much gobble up anything that will make it onto the Hugo or Nebula shortlist. Right. And try and geek out as much as possible. 01:07:05 [Speaker Changed] I had no idea you were a geek. Any non-fiction that that crosses your transom? 01:07:10 [Speaker Changed] Well, the one that’s really kind of stood out to me, and it was recommended by a former colleague of mine from BlackRock is 4,000 weeks. 01:07:17 [Speaker Changed] So good. 01:07:18 [Speaker Changed] So good. And as someone who’s tried to optimize my life many times in the past, but have had a couple he health setbacks and things like that, this was a great reminder that getting through the to to-do list is not the goal. 01:07:31 [Speaker Changed] Right. Oliver, Oliver Burke, something like that. 01:07:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:07:34 [Speaker Changed] The, the line that I remember from that book was 4,000 weeks is about 80 years is human lifespan. Yeah. Human life is insultingly brief. Yes. And that phrase just stood out. 01:07:48 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And this idea that we are all, every day approaching our death is actually empowering. Yes. Instead of discouraging. If you know that you don’t have infant time, you make better decisions. Frankly, 01:08:02 [Speaker Changed] Scarcity is an important economic thesis. 01:08:05 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But you cut out the stuff that’s not important and you focus on the things and the people and the experiences that are, and anyway, I love this book. 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, I totally agree. Final two questions. Yeah. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career of, normally I would say whatever the person’s specific specialty is, but you’ve done so much across consulting and strategy and buy side and sell side and hedge funds and portfolio management, and now chief investment strategy. Someone interested in just finance or wealth management. 01:08:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I would say the most important thing is to keep an open mind. One of the most frustrating things, you know, young graduates and even young graduates from business school or or other graduate programs, is that they have like a path in mind. You know, in three or five years I expect to be here in 10 years. And I say keep an open mind because there’s so much disruption and so much change across these industries. You can’t have a mapped out plan. Your goal is to be a sponge and to learn and learn and learn, and also to be patient. Honestly, Barry, I’d say this a lot because you know, you get some like really smart 23, 24, 20 8-year-old who you know, wants to find out what’s over the next hill. And I wanna remind them, you know, if the actuarial tables are even somewhat right, they have 70 more years of life ahead of them. I think that’s right. And they don’t need to rush. They can enjoy the moment of learning, enjoy the experience, and understanding that not just, they’ll have the opportunity to pivot. They’ll have the mandate to pivot. As you know, industries get disrupted and technology evolves. Huh. 01:09:43 [Speaker Changed] Fascinating. And our final question. Yeah. What is it that you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew 25, 30 years ago when you were first getting started? 01:09:54 [Speaker Changed] I thought there was a more systematic way to approach investing when I first started, you know, close to three decades ago. And now I understand that true investing is both art and science. Maybe that’s the reason why I think I’ll stay in this business for the rest of my life because I’m constantly intellectually challenged to not get frustrated if a model doesn’t work out. In fact, sometimes the process of going through creating a model or a piece of analysis or going down a rabbit hole in research that doesn’t yield anything this year may actually be really helpful for me in three years, or help to reframe my thought process. So understanding that it’s not perfect and that it’s art and science. 01:10:33 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. Thanks Kate for being so generous with your time.

Kate Moore is having. Her background is everything from Morgan Stanley to more capital to Bank America, Merrill Lynch to JP Morgan to BlackRock. She’s now Chief Investment officer of Citibank’s Citi Wealth, which runs, you know, something like a trillion dollars. The breadth and depth of her experience makes her uniquely situated to be a chief investment officer. She’s had, you know, just about every job on the buy side and sell side, including portfolio manager, consultant to LBOs and m and as she’s just done so much stuff, it’s so interesting that she really brings just this unique set of experiences to Citi. I thought this conversation was really interesting and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Kate Moore. Kate Moore: Thanks so much, Barry. I’m psyched to be having this conversation today Barry Ritholtz: Long overdue. Yeah, we’ve, we’ve been like ships in the night. I, I’m so glad I finally got, got you here. Let’s start a little bit with your academic background. Yeah. Which is kind of surprised me. Bachelor’s in political and social thought from the University of Virginia, a Master’s in Political Economy from University of Chicago. What was the original career plan? Kate Moore: I mean, I think Barry underlying your question was like, Kate, you sound kind of nerdy but not as nerdy as some of the folks who have like triple degrees in statistics. But so where did this political and social thought and political economy stuff come from? So at University of Virginia, this PST program is interdisciplinary and that was really attractive. You also apply during your second year so you have a chance to like send it, cut a sample, some different disciplines before you do it. And it’s an incredible seminar program. So you’re working with some really amazing professors throughout the way. I loved being able to take classes in economics, in politics, in theory, in philosophy. I also took a lot of studio art classes and stuff as an undergrad, but I was able to combine all of this stuff together. So I loved that. And then I worked for a couple years and I decided, you know, hey, what I really am good at and what I love is academics and I wanna be a professor. This was my, my idea. I’m gonna go back to school and get my PhD and be a professor. I had this whole vision for myself that involved like, you know, writing books in the summer I would be doing cool research. I have a pack of golden retrievers and you know, I’d like rock climb on the side. This is whole vision of my academic life. So I applied to PhD programs and I went to University of Chicago for political economy. So this intersection of policy and politics, you know, international theory and you know, economics. And I found once I was there, honestly, that many people in my program are taking eight to 10 years to get through their PhD and becoming so specialized in very arcane topics. And it was like not appealing to me since I had already worked and everything. So I left after my master’s, but I did my work on, you know, this intersection of economics and policy with a focus on emerging markets and China. So I was ahead of my time. Barry Ritholtz: It’s so interesting that you talk about how specialized some people become. It’s pretty clear, at least historically, many of the greatest investors in history had a very broad set of interest and a broad set of skills. Few of them were an inch wide and a mile deep. They weren’t a mile wide and an inch deep, but they were broad enough that they were able to pull in things from other fields that applied to investing. Did you find something similar when you’re studying political science and economics to, how did that shape your investing philosophy? Kate Moore: Absolutely. I think, you know, the best macro investors or able to pull in, you know, different inputs from policy and politics, it’s also really helpful I think to understand human behavior. So if you’re taking an interdisciplinary approach to your academics and your investing life, I think you’re well set up. So in this, I mean I took a bunch of courses on game theory and stuff as a, in my graduate work and understanding payoffs and incentives, doing some work on behavioral economics, all of that combines really well. And my experience too was that the best investors that I worked for over the course of my career also took in all of these different inputs and we’re constantly trying to solve a puzzle, right? It wasn’t just, you know, a two variable puzzle. It was a multi-variable puzzle understanding that every day you wake up and you have to do it anew. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, no, no doubt about it. It’s so funny you mention incentives. Whenever I see a situation that I find completely perplexing and can’t figure it out, what usually leads to the answer is what, what are the incentives that led to this situation? I want you to work backwards from that. So let’s talk a little bit about the strategy and consulting side. You begin your career, Mitchell, Madison and Silver Oak Partners, is that right? Yes. Those two shops. Tell us a little bit about what you did for them and the sort of work and problem solving you did for those firms. Okay, 00:05:34 [Speaker Changed] So both Mitchell Madison, silver Oak no longer exist, right? For the record, Mitchell Madison was formed out of a spinoff of a bunch of McKinsey partners and it was taking kind of a new way, a new approach frankly, to some of the similar types of clients as McKinsey had. And, but it had this very entrepreneurial kind of environment because it was a break off, but it was still really large and global. I did a bunch of like strategy consulting projects, things you would expect, including some cool stuff in the media space just at the time where the internet was becoming popular. And some of these websites like Amazon that we take for granted were getting launched. So I learned a lot about media and e-commerce in those early stages at Mitchell Madison, but Mitchell Madison, for those of you who may recognize it, went through a merger with us Web CKS, which was a technology consulting firm. 00:06:33 All the combined entity got rebranded as March 1st, which was the date that the deal was inked. Kind of a weird marketing decision on that part, but you know, the, the, the business started to change and a number of the partners like broke off and started Silver Oak, which focused on leverage buyout firms. Now here is what was really cool. I wasn’t doing work for let’s say the LBO in master form, but rather like a collection of the companies in the portfolio at the same time trying to find synergies. There were things that are traditional around sourcing, but things that were maybe less traditional around finding strategic combinations. And I had a great opportunity to get exposed to a lot of different industries, you know, from traditional manufacturers to telecom companies, financial services and everything in between. And I have to say, Barry, that experience, you know, working for these kind of small and mid-sized LBO owned companies really set me up well for understanding and investing in a broad array of equities. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the investing side. Your next stop is Morgan Stanley, obviously a legendary and giant sell side firm. Tell us your, about your experiences at Morgan Stanley. Yeah, Kate Moore: So how I got to Morgan Stanley investment management is perhaps kind of interesting. So we were just talking about my academic background and I was doing this, you know, political economy degree at University of Chicago and I had had this sort of moment where I realized I wasn’t gonna pursue the PhD. So I, you know, made an appointment with my advisor and I said, you know, professor Harold, I’m not sure I wanna do the PhD. And he starts laughing and we’re sitting in his office, he said, Kate, I’ve been waiting for this conversation for six months. Oh completely. Wow. I said, oh my gosh. Like do you know, do you think I’m screwing up here? He said, no, you’re top of the class. What I do recognize though is because you’ve worked before for a number of years before coming into a PhD program, you have a different skillset and you’re approaching this differently. He’s like, I think you can finish your PhD later. You know, do the master’s and whatever. So I had this in my mind and I, so I started to put out a couple feelers, but I wasn’t really committed to what I would do post, you know, getting my master’s degree. Barry Ritholtz:And this is out of Chicago, rght? 00:08:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s in Chicago. And then a strange thing happened, I was back on the east coast visiting my parents and I got a call from the career services people at University of Chicago. I was still, you know, enrolled in school there just getting my thesis graded. And they said, Hey, we got an incoming call from the Chief Investment officer of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. This guy’s name is Joe McLinden. Joe is looking to add to his macro investing team on the buy side and specifically is looking for candidates that are not MBAs. He wanted people who had this understanding of politics and economics and everything in between. And I said, Hey guys, I’m not interested in going back into that form of finance. I’m gonna do something different. They said, do us this favor and go on the interview. Barry Ritholtz: Just like, just just meet with them. Yeah. 00:09:35 [Speaker Changed] Like let’s put up a good candidate. You kind of meet the criteria. If it’s not your bag, it’s not your bag. And I went and met this team at Morgan Stanley investment management and people who had economics and history and philosophy degrees, but were macro investors. And I was like, okay, A, these people are cool and b, I love how they’re solving the problems. Two weeks later I accepted an offer. I fell into investing Barry. Barry Ritholtz: Wow, that’s that’s really fascinating. And, and you’ve had a breadth of experiences beyond Morgan Stanley. You were at more Capital well regarded hedge funds, bank of America, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, you spent a lot of time at BlackRock. Tell us what was fun, what did you learn at these other shops? Kate Moore: So I’ve had a really cool career in the sense that I’ve done, you know, a variety of different buy-side, more traditional mutual funds. But even when I was at s Im, we launched the first internal hedge fund. This is before Morgan Stanley bought Front Point and I worked at a big macro hedge fund through the financial crisis, as you mentioned, at more capital that was an adventure. I did a few years on the sell side at B of a Merrill as global equity and emerging market strategist. And then I went to JP Morgan, managed the discretionary multi-asset portfolios for the private bank. Then I spent a, a long time at BlackRock, most of it as a portfolio manager for global allocation, kind of the flagship multi-asset fund. I have to say I love the fact that I have experienced all sides of the investing business and it makes me understand what makes investors tick a lot more than people who just stayed in their lane. Like I get the retail side, the institutional side, what fast money does, what traders do, what fundamental investors do. And I interpret all this sort of sentiment and flow data as part of my process as a result of having this exposure to different parts of the investment management business. Barry Ritholtz: Sounds really, really interesting. So from all of these different backgrounds, what finally brought you to Citi? Kate Moore: Yeah, so I, I was at a bit of an interesting inflection point I would say in my career here I am. I’ve loved being at BlackRock, I really enjoyed the work, but I also recognized I was kind of ready to take the next big step and I could continue to be a portfolio manager at BlackRock and it’s an amazing firm, but I was kind of wondering what it would sort of, what what I should do to take this next step. And I looked around and said where are the areas of growth in the business? And traditional mutual funds we know are not a huge growth area for the business. Even if your performance is exceptional, you know, keeping your assets can be a challenge. And I saw wealth as an area of consistent growth. I think most people would agree on that front for sure. 00:12:22 And, and you know, there’s some growth in alternatives, but it felt like just a different flavor of the stuff I was doing. So I was sort of intrigued by this idea of, of working in wealth, especially because I’ve done a lot of asset allocation and the multi-asset discipline I come from and I love the challenge of helping people grow their money over time. But I hadn’t, I didn’t have like a great idea in my head of what I was gonna do. This was just sort of something that was a seed that was planted and not yet out of the soil if it were. Hmm. And in August of 2024, Andy Seig, who I’d known in the business for like 15 years or so, never worked together directly. But you know, we’d met a number of times, been on panels together, had good cordial relationship. He called me and said, Kate, I have an idea for you. And he had been at Citi for a year then as you know, CEO of wealth. And I thought, okay, this is interesting, but I need to turn it over in my head a little bit. Is this gonna be the right pivot? And ultimately I got so excited Barry because Citi was already in this massive transformation. Andy is a really inspirational leader. I’m not just saying that ’cause he’s my boss, but I think most people on the street will agree. He has a vision he executes and this was a new challenge for me. I’d be flexing different muscles and I thought to myself, for this next big push in my career, I wanna be someplace where I can be entrepreneurial, where I’m gonna be supported by the overall platform where, you know, I can continue to grow out my experience as an investor. And so ultimately I made the tough decision to leave a firm that I loved for a new and exciting challenge. Barry Ritholtz: Safe to say that this shift in career was the biggest inflection point. Kate Moore: It feels like it’s the biggest inflection point in my career, but it also feels cumulative. I don’t know if that makes sense, but perfect sense Barry Ritholtz: I understand exactly what you’re saying. All all of these different elements come together almost like a perfect storm. Yeah. And suddenly now we’re off to the, to the whole nother level. Kate Moore: Yeah. I’ve been building up these experiences over the course of my career and kind of setting me up to take on this new challenge. It does feel the largest in part because I’ve been so concentrated on being an investor over the course of my career. And this is a combination of strategy and, and business leadership and investing. And so as I said, I’m flexing, flexing a bunch of different muscles. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s put some numbers, some flesh on the bone. So the groups you lead the wealth group at at Citi, what’s the assets they’re investing and typically who are the clients? Are they mom and pop investors? Are they institutional? A little of both. Kate Moore: Yeah. So I’ll give you some numbers as of end of 2024 because everything else, of course is in flux in the first part. Barry Ritholtz: We know how that works. Kate Moore: Yeah. I’m in, in the middle of studying for series 65, what will be like my 39th millionth of Barry Ritholtz: But that one you could do in your sleep. It’s not like the seven, which is or the options. Yeah. I forgot which one was the options. That was a giant like wait, I need to learn about gamma, why not? Kate Moore: Totally. I’ve taken the options one too. What I will tell you is the one thing that’s a little bit annoying on the economic section of the series 65 is that, you know, I don’t always agree. Barry Ritholtz: Was gonna say the answers are wrong answer. Once you get past that, the test is really easy. Kate Moore: For Example, it was like, you know, our payrolls a leading lagging or coincident indicator. Very, of course Barry Ritholtz: It’s lagging! Of course or anything but lagging because it’s two months old. Kate Moore: Totally. And like plus or minus 100 Barry Ritholtz: They, they said coincidental, right? Totally. Yeah. It’s just there. I, I remember having an, this is by the way, 30 something years ago, 20 something years ago. I remember calling up and yelling at somebody like, just so you know, I didn’t get any of these answers wrong. And the three you marked wrong, you are wrong. And let me explain why totally. How, how can payrolls, which are a model that uses 1, 2, 3 month old data be anything other than a Kate Moore: Lagging and that get totally restated every two years. Right. And the, the error bands, but the subsequent monthly revisions, I mean by the time you get to the actual number, it’s like half a decade old. It’s nonsense Barry Ritholtz: a hundred percent. Kate Moore: We have to pretend.And yet of course the market moves a lot on payrolls stay and we have to pretend that matters in the moment. Yeah, we have to pretend. Okay, where were we going before? Barry Ritholtz: I have no idea. But I just love the fact that you’re studying for the 65. I know studying in air quotes, Kate Moore: I get to whiz through the equity and hedge fund and everything sort of sections of it. But I have to memorize their answers for economics. Barry Ritholtz: If it, if it wasn’t embarrassing to fail, yeah. I would say you can wing it and you’ll do just fine. I think 70 is a passing, you’ll get like 80 just off the top of your head. But no one wants to go in and fail ’cause it’s embarrassing Kate Moore: No, I’m very like, I, I’ve made my career off of being a perfectionist, you know, in my analysis. That’s so funny. And you know, I do not accept a barely passing grade. I do not expect, I, I accept, you know, index like performance. I’m always seeking alpha and I’m doing my best to do that in the most risk adjusted way, even Barry Ritholtz:In an examination that’s pass fail. Yeah. And we know objectively, logically anything over a 71 is wasted effort. But yeah. But I know where exactly where you coming Kate Moore: From. I can’t sleep at night. I can’t sleep at night if it’s just good enough. And that’s also how I wanna approach things for my clients. Okay, we’re talking about Citi here. And so Citi has about a trillion do, Citi Wealth has a trillion dollars in assets close to like 600, you know, billion of that is in investments and there’s other parts in deposits and loans and things like that. And there are three main segments, right? There’s a traditional kind of private bank, ultra high net worth service, right? There’s Citi Gold, which is mass affluent, and then there is a wealth at work which targets like very specific segments like the law firm population, et cetera. Barry Ritholtz: Makes a lot, makes a ton of sense. Kate Moore: What I will say is Citi as a bank has so many global customers and clients and people with longstanding relationships that haven’t been tapped. You know, there’s, there is an enormous amount of potential to grow the wealth business just from existing Citi customers. And I think as you probably know, half of our business is outside of the US and it is a, it is a, Barry Ritholtz:Is it 50%? It’s fully half, yeah. Wow. That’s amazing. Yeah. Kate Moore: And the Asia business for us and particularly our legacy in China and surrounding areas is incredibly strong. And that was something that was also very attractive to me, to be honest with you. As someone who has been an, an emerging markets investor at times and a student of China, you know, the ability to get really deep into the opportunity to grow wealth in multiple different areas was exciting. 00:19:15 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really fascinating. So before we talk about Citi, let’s start a little bit with your time at BlackRock. You joined them almost a decade ago in 2016 you were chief equity strategist. Tell us a little bit about your initial role and how that played off of what you had been doing previously. 00:19:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so I joined BlackRock to be part of the BlackRock Investment Institute, which is kind of the internal macro think tank. And the institute has a couple of different functions. There is a segment that is client facing, but there’s also a big function around bringing together the investors across all the platforms in BlackRock and convening for, you know, forums and symposiums around specific topics. And although I was called Chief equity strategist, I actually sat on the equity platform with all the equity PMs and my job was to be basically embedded in all of the equity portfolios as the macro. My team was the macro resource for them and it was great. And you know, I always knew that I would do that for a little while. They basically said, can you do this and help to sort of change some of the equity culture and to have some macro inputs and then you can kind of figure out where you wanna sit. And ultimately, you know, moving back to a multi-asset fund made the most sense for me because here’s my joke, Barry, like I think of myself as being a macro equity investor, you know, combining macro stuff into equities, but the macro people will say, I’m equity and the equity people will say I’m macro. Yeah, that makes sense. So a multi-asset fund is a, is a good home for me. Huh? 00:20:50 [Speaker Changed] So 2019 you start working with the thematic strategy and portfolio manager group. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about thematics that’s become sort of an alternative to beta in a lot of shops. BlackRock especially. 00:21:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well let me say this, I actually started my career, you know, at Morgan Stanley investment management and the hedge fund that my team launched at MIM was a global thematic hedge fund. This is way back like over 23 years ago at this point. So we were ahead of our times, right? So I’ve actually had this thematic approach, frankly in my investment approach throughout my entire career. And it’s just now becoming really popular to call everything a thematic. So lemme say this, I think there are three ways at this time to approach thematics, three different flavors if you will. The first is this kind of like long duration slow bleed thematic. Like eventually we are going to have reduce the amount of plastics in all of our goods. And so we wanna lean into companies that are investing in that transition. You 00:22:01 [Speaker Changed] Don’t think microplastics accumulating in your lungs and bloodstream is a bad thing. 00:22:06 [Speaker Changed] It is definitely a bad thing. I wonder if I’m a little bit cooked when it comes to that already. But this is kind of a set it and forget it strategy, right? Where you identify companies that are making these changes or facilitating the changes and you buy a basket of them and you or an ETF that invests ’em and then you just set it. The second type of thematics is what I would call like discontinuous change, catalyst driven thematics. And these are more tactical, like, you know, it could be a couple quarters, it could be up to a year or two or even longer. But this is kind of a more actively managed way to approach thematics, right? Where, so you identify the idea, you identify the catalysts, you identify the players, and actually there’s more of a rotation in the names and the sizing of that expression in the thematic. That’s really exciting. It’s also hard because sometimes you look around and say, I don’t see a ton of catalysts here. There’s nothing really jumping out. You 00:23:02 [Speaker Changed] Gotta get the theme, right? The asset class, right? And the timing right 00:23:05 [Speaker Changed] And the sizing, you know, within that, right? And so that’s not like by 40 companies that are thinking about microplastics. It is like four to eight names, a more concentrated expression around a theme. You’re taking some idiosyncratic risk and you are continuing to to invest around that. And then the third type of thematic investing, I would say is really business cycle thematic. And a lot of people talk about this, you know, today there’s a, you know, where are we in the cycle? What are the companies sectors or qualities that perform well in that part of the cycle? I’m thematically investing in inflation beneficiaries, et cetera. And I’ve always liked to do those two, kind of number two and number three together, which is the catalyst driven and the business cycle. And I think that together makes a nice portfolio. 00:23:54 [Speaker Changed] You know, I recall back in the day when we were talking about sort of thematic cycle investing, business cycle investing, it was used to go by the name sector rotation. Yeah. I don’t know if anybody still does that sort of stuff anymore, it 00:24:09 [Speaker Changed] Seems like, or the investment clock. Do you remember the investment clock? Sure, sure. Absolutely. Everyone had an investment clock, which was like this two dimensional representation of which sectors or which maybe style factors. Once that became part of our lexicon performed well in different macro environments, 00:24:26 [Speaker Changed] It was always sort of a sine wave. And here’s where we are in this sector here in the sector there. Yeah. If it only were, were that easy. 00:24:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, I, I won’t call out names, but I know some folks that like to chart where we are, which quadrant we’re in, right. You know, on a regular basis. And instead of this nice round circle or an oval, you know, it’s very sort of spastic point to point, to point to point because the macro data is moving so quickly and the positioning data, which also indicates, you know, investor risk, appetite changes so rapidly that we jump from one quadrant to the other sometimes month to month. 00:25:05 [Speaker Changed] So, so you mentioned removing plastic from the food supply or wherever. Yeah. What other trends have you looked at? Deglobalization, decarbonization ai. What gets you excited these days? 00:25:18 [Speaker Changed] Oh wait, you just said a hot button word for me, which is deglobalization. And let me just say I don’t believe in deglobalization. 00:25:24 [Speaker Changed] I’m with you, but I want to hear your reasons why. 00:25:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I don’t believe in deglobalization because even if, let’s say hypothetically the US and China continue to separate and by hypothetical I was making a joke for all the listeners, of course the US and China are gonna continue to separate. That doesn’t mean the relationships between each of these countries and other trading partners or allies is not gonna deepen, right? Maybe we call it re globalization instead of de-globalization, but a, a shifting of some other relationships. But I have spent a lot of my time, like a lot of folks frankly, looking at themes in and around technology. I mentioned the microplastics. It’s actually not a theme I’ve invested in. The only couple companies I’ve really seen who are geared towards that are private. And so it’s harder to access. But around technology, you know, a few areas I’ve been pretty excited about for a good considerable amount of time has been, you know, have been in, in software. 00:26:20 And one of those areas is cybersecurity. This was a major theme for me in the portfolio at Global allocation at BlackRock. And basically every time I was thinking that I’d want to either shift out of the theme or reduce it, there was another event on the horizon or something happening that led to increased spend in this space. I’ve now come to believe that investment in, in security software is existential for companies, right? And while there’s room to rotate, you know, names based on capabilities, et cetera, I believe it’s a, it’s a core part of a portfolio 00:26:54 [Speaker Changed] Longstanding secular trend that’s gonna be ongoing. 00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But I first put on this investment in January of 2020 Okay. When I was at BlackRock and that was before the pandemic and it was basically based on geopolitical risk and of course the pandemic that increased the risk from all this data for many different companies. So we saw big up uptick in spends. As I said, it was a, it’s been a rolling series of catalysts over the last five and a half years and makes it more of a secular theme than a, a shorter term catalyst driven theme. So. 00:27:25 [Speaker Changed] So let’s drill down a little bit to your core investment philosophy. You’ve mentioned thematics, you’ve mentioned pursuing Alpha. Tell us what is Kate Moore’s investment philosophy? 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it’s really important to have three pillars to your decision making and one pillar that’s off to the side that’s controversial. So I think you have to start with a macro view. I think you need to understand politics policy, the major economic data you need to understand government behaviors. ’cause so much of that dictates the environment for different industries. And some people just sort of brush it off. By the way, I love my equity colleagues and friends, but nothing makes the hair on the back of my neck go up more and kind of me bristle than to hear. I don’t pay attention to macro because I just pick good companies. Well good, you’ll be out of business. You don’t have a choice in this environment. You can’t set it and forget it for the next three years and not focus on what’s happening in the business cycle and policy and how that may impact the interest and desire to own your asset class. 00:28:29 So I think macro is critical and a good starting point. I also like to get into the fundamentals of things, right? Like where are the fundamental thematically, like who’s growing, what technology has come out, where do we think about, you know, changes in consumer behavior, changes in supply chains, and where are the real kind of fundamental opportunities? What are the companies doing? Well I think that’s not controversial either, but with the third stage, and it’s really important to me, I mean it’s grown in importance over the course of my career is the positioning, sentiment and technicals. And this has become really, really, really important for your, for defining your entry and exit points, even if you are a long-term investor because the markets move really quickly and you need to be really thoughtful about how you enter and exit. So I pay attention to flows, hedge fund, mutual fund positioning, introduction of new instruments, you know, a million things we kind of look at at our dashboard. And then this is the one I was saying the pillar off to the side valuation is a nice to know, but it is not a driving force of my investment process. And people might kind of cringe when I say that, you 00:29:40 [Speaker Changed] Know, know what, let me jump in here and, and I won’t explore that ’cause I don’t disagree with any of that. People kind of forget that bull markets that run 10, 20 years, valuations tend to start on the lower end and they tend to end on the higher end. But if you decide, oh, we’re above the average valuation of the past cycle, you’re missing a lot of upside, aren’t you? 00:30:06 [Speaker Changed] Ton of upside. Well there’s also this assumption that that underpins this view on valuations. That there is some sort of mean reversion, right? 00:30:13 [Speaker Changed] Tomorrow we’re gonna snap at, look at the cape is my favorite example of that. Yeah, the Schiller cyclically adjusted PE ratio. You would’ve been out like 90% since 1990. A hundred. Yeah. If you followed that, it’s, it’s kind of wild. 00:30:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, for sure. You would absolutely have not taken advantage of an incredible run in equities. Like, just to make this point and underscore it, I say evaluation is a starting point for your investment decision, what you’re screening for and entry and exit points. You would never own US tech and you would be long Russia, you know, and anyone who wants to take that trade, God bless, but you’ll be out of business, right? 00:30:50 [Speaker Changed] Russia’s been cheap, but some stocks are cheap for a reason. 00:30:54 [Speaker Changed] They are European banks cheap for reason. And we know that kind of over the medium term, this I’ll define as kind of three years, you know, stocks can stay quote unquote expensive or the way I like to say it be valued at a higher end of the market range because they are superior businesses and they can stay at those levels for multiple years, sometimes much longer and continue to rerate and stuff can look like it’s a discount to the rest of the market, but be structurally impaired and therefore deserve the discount. The other problem I have when people do these kind of like mean reversion, you know, valuation trades as they say like, oh we need to go back to some historical period where s and p was at 14 times, right? Why? I mean the market composition from a sector perspective completely different. The balance sheets of these companies completely different. The cash profiles and free cash generation of these companies completely different. The regulatory environment, the politics, the behavior, the market technicals, I can go on and on and on. It is literally the laziest piece of analysis I have ever seen. 00:32:04 [Speaker Changed] When when you look at last century companies like US Steel or even General Motors, you know, the expression was men in material, they need tons of capital giant factories today, two people with a laptop and Amazon web servers. You could, you could do as much business as any startup from any decade previously. 00:32:27 [Speaker Changed] Totally. I mean another example I like to use, like near and dear to our hearts in terms of the investment landscape is, you know, how many analysts do I really need to cover all different sorts of sectors? You know? And it, there was a time where I needed everyone to be an expert in a different industry or a different sector and to be very siloed and and deeply specialized. But right now I can be in a meeting sitting across the table from A CEO or CFO and they may be talking about a business that I only know 50% about, right? And I, in real time, I can use my AI tools, I can pull up what their competitors have said in recent earnings calls or you know, in the social media, I can look up terminology, I can pull up data. I am a hundred times more informed. I don’t need to be briefed for three hours from an analyst before I walk into that meeting. You know, just by understanding the types of questions to ask and having this data at my fingertips, I’m a faster and better investor. 00:33:25 [Speaker Changed] So here’s the challenge, and we could talk about AI as a theme in a little bit, but the challenge is you’ve gone through that whole process over the past 10, 20 years where you’ve, you know, done the reps put in the heavy lifting. Yeah. How is the next generation going to become the Kate Moore in 25 years if they don’t get to go through that process? And AI seems to, the phrase I heard recently was removing the bottom rung on the career ladder. Is this, is this a genuine concern? 00:33:59 [Speaker Changed] It is somewhat of a concern and I think it’s more of a concern for, for kids who are going through school and are incredibly specialized about what they’re studying. And this is kind of a flag frankly, I would say to people, you don’t wanna just take courses in one discipline. Your job as an undergrad. And I would also argue even in grad school, even in MBA program, is to learn how to think and learn how to ask questions to get exposed to as many different disciplines as possible. So I tell like young folks, like you gotta study philosophy, you should also study things like art history because there’s context behind it. You should study things like you know, hard sciences because you know, it gives you a discipline in terms of the way that you’re thinking you should take a music theory class. I mean do all of this. You want your brain to be flexible and compliant. You want to be able to approach the problem by using these tools in unique ways. And people who are only point and shoot, only have one specific way of approaching an investment problem are often wrong. 00:35:04 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really, really interesting. So you were brought to Citi specifically to focus on the wealth business there. What’s your strategy for breathing life into that space? 00:35:18 [Speaker Changed] So I think there are a couple things. We have a lot of amazing raw material at at Citi in terms of human capital and of course our clients. But thinking about how to invest in a different way than perhaps my other wealth competitors invest is, is one of the greatest challenges and opportunities. And here’s what I will say, you know, I want to examine the way that we’re approaching discretionary multi-asset class asset allocation products, right? Just to sort of set it and forget it. Here’s your stock bonds cash, I’m not sure is gonna be the right path moving forward. I mean, we want to think about what is the right combination of both asset class and factor exposures for, for clients in different risk profiles and how do we implement in, in an interesting way in that space. So it’s not just like, hey we have a, you know, large cap stock fund or, and we have a, you know, mid, mid duration bond fund and this is what we’re kind kind of combining together. This is really about, you know, what are the best expressions of each of those things? How much of it should be beta? How much of it should be alpha seeking? Whether it’s you know, sector specific or thematic. What is the best implementation in alternatives? And particularly as we get more liquid alternatives available, you know, that sort of diversification in a portfolio is going to be kind of democratized and we’re gonna see more and more of our clients across risk spectrum be able to access that. So, 00:36:51 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about the opportunities in the wealth business. What’s driving the growth here? Is it just the amount of capital that’s sloshing around? How big are demographics, the move towards alternatives? There’s so many different cross currents going on that make that space so attractive. What do you see as the key drivers? 00:37:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, there’s a bunch of different drivers, Barry. I’d say, you know, first of all there’s been an enormous amount of wealth created. We know over the last, you know, 10 years, it’s longer than that. But let’s just say in the last 10 years 00:37:23 [Speaker Changed] Post-financial crisis. 00:37:24 [Speaker Changed] Post-financial crisis, great 15 00:37:25 [Speaker Changed] Year run. 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And big concentrations of wealth and frankly a lot of very wealthy families have held a lot of these, this wealth in cash, you know, or in cash equivalents or have reinvested in their business. I think there’s now an understanding that they wanna diversify. So the investment opportunity set for all this wealth creation is huge. I’d say there’s another trend, and I’m sure people have talked about this before with you, which is like the transfer of wealth that’s gonna happen from the b the boomer generation to my generation, and then ultimately to our, you know, younger generation. And the values and the interests on the investing side change from generation to generation. You know, the types of risk clients wanna take, the types of like bespoke opportunities and private stuff that they wanna do. Maybe it’s around, you know, environmental social governance stuff. Maybe it’s around specific geographies, mission aligned. I mean I think that the flavor of investing is changing, which also makes us super exciting. And then finally I would say can, you know, the, the breadth of investment instruments that are available to individual investors and into wealthy families is actually really exciting because you can do cooler things than just a 60 40 portfolio, which was kind of the way wealth businesses ran in the past. 00:38:46 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. So you had mentioned the role of behavioral finance in some of your education and background. You were at University of Chicago, which has become a hotbed of behavioral finance. Dick Thaler. Yeah. He’s recipient of the Nobel. Tell us how you think about behavioral economics in your day job. How do you help clients steer through some of this year as a perfect example, a lot of volatility, a lot of sterman, drang, and here we are above where we were before liberation day. How do you guide people through that? 00:39:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, this is such a tough one, Barry, because you know, this is where understanding kind of the positioning, the technicals and the biases really differentiate a good investor from maybe a less good investor. One of the things I try and pay close attention to are all of these sentiment indicators and like, you know, the dashboard for sentiment indicators continues to change, right? Sometimes we look at, you know, historic filings, but we know that mutual funds and hedge funds change their positions really quickly. Sometimes we look at the volume and the flow. I like to pay attention to more kind of third party and, you know, coincident things like what, what’s being discussed in different social media or on different message boards or whatever. And to just try and understand what’s capturing the attention and energy from different client segments. But I also pay really close attention to frankly, how the market responds to different types of news. And that gives you a good sense. You gotta have your finger on that pulse. You know, I, I learned this from someone named Ben Hunt, who you may be familiar with. Of course, 00:40:32 [Speaker Changed] You’re right. Epsilon theory. 00:40:33 [Speaker Changed] Epsilon theory. So I learned this from Ben years ago, but he said, you know, number one, the first order to getting things right is like having a good forecast, right? Let’s just say you have a forecast for stock earnings. The second order is to understand what consensus thinks, right? And comparing your number against that, right? But to get it really right in the market, you need to understand what consensus thinks. Consensus thinks 00:40:59 [Speaker Changed] It’s a Kane’s beauty contest. 00:41:02 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And, but, but kind of instilling that in my team is really important because it’s like, great, I’m so glad you think we’re gonna have $263 of s and p earnings this year. If consensus actually thinks it’s 2 67, we should know that too. But if the printed number is 2 67 but everyone’s just dragging their feet on cutting the numbers and they’re actually at 2 55, that makes a difference in terms of how people take risk and respond to different news. And so, you know, kind of, of putting all these pieces together, doing the work, understanding what like written or published consensus is and then getting all these kind of sentiment inputs to really evaluate what is the whisper real number versus what’s published. 00:41:46 [Speaker Changed] So let me push back slightly on sentiment ’cause I want to get your take on this. So my experience generally has been most day-to-day sentiment is kind of noisy and it really matters when it hits an extreme. At least that’s a trader’s perspective. But the thing I really wanna push back on has been the University of Michigan. Yeah. Consumer sentiment data, which over the past couple of years it’s been worse than the financial crisis, worse than the beginning of the pandemic, worse than the the 2001 September 11th attacks or the.com implosion worse than the 87 crash. How do we figure out what’s going on in sentiment where it seems to have just detached from consumer behavior, Hey, everything is terrible, but we’re going out and spending totally, 00:42:38 [Speaker Changed] We’re still going out to restaurants even though we think the world is ending, right? Yeah, no, you’re absolutely right. So any single sentiment indicator or survey needs to be discounted, right? We need to come combine all these things and look at it kind of on a moving average of a number of prints. Another one that kind of flagged for me was the conference board confidence, which hit the lowest levels from like September of 2011, you know, last month. And that was a crazy number, right? Because it, September of 2011, we had just gone through this debt fiasco. We were going to Operation Twist, you know, there was like 00:43:11 [Speaker Changed] Post flash crash, it had gotten even crazy. 00:43:14 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. So, you know, that, that seemed really disconnected from reality. So sometimes you have to discount all of these things, but your point is well taken. There has been a generalized sentiment deterioration. Another one I look at is the, what is now the Richmond Fed, but historically had been the Duke Fuqua CFO survey. And you’ve seen over the past couple years this massive decoupling between expectations for own company over the next six months where the CFOs are going, like things are pretty good actually. And expectations for the economy where they’re like, the economy’s in trouble. 00:43:46 [Speaker Changed] It’s so funny you bring that up ’cause well first I had Tom barking and not too long ago, but second, we see that everywhere my congressman’s okay, but the rest of Congress thinks totally my financial circumstances seem to be pretty good, but we think the economy is going lower. Like that exact sort of sentiment split. What do you imagine is driving people to think, Hey, things aren’t that bad for me, but everywhere else it stinks. 00:44:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, hmm, this is tough one, but I, I honestly think the news flow, how media portrays recent events, the echo chamber on social media, the fact that people are not getting a broad based view. Do you see all these, you know, traditional news programs now that are trying to dedicate one night a week or whatever the heck it is to the good news, right? They’re 00:44:36 [Speaker Changed] Is that true? That’s, 00:44:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s like, that’s funny. There’s a, there’s a, a local channel I’ve watched that it will do one good story after they’ve just reported a bunch of like murders and you know, everything for the previous 25 minutes. The last story is like, they’re trying to leave you on a positive note, huh? I’m mean like, okay, but the skew is definitely really negative. 00:44:55 [Speaker Changed] If it, if it bleeds it leads, that’s always been the news thing. Yeah. 00:44:58 [Speaker Changed] Really, really fascinating. But now people are consuming more of that 00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] And so I think, I think you’re definitely onto something. But 00:45:04 [Speaker Changed] So we, yeah, we do maybe need to z score the sentiment right now, let’s just put it that way. We, we have to adjust for this declining overall sentiment. But when I’m talking about sentiment, I also like, I’m trying to infer sentiment from price reactions to different news, right? And that might be a better gauge in some of these surveys where people can say, you know, the sky is falling but then just book a carnival cruise, right? Like, you know the, and you know, if a stock puts up pretty good numbers in terms of earnings but doesn’t beat by huge margin and falls 15%, you can tell that like people are at the edge, right? And so, you know, you have to kind of correct your own equity exposure for that type of behavior, huh. But your point’s well taken on you mish and on, you know, all of these other surveys, there’s been a generalized decline. We have to correct for that. 00:45:52 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. So let’s talk a little bit about today’s market environment. 2025 has been kind of a volatile wacky year. What, what’s your current macro view on the global economy? What’s going on in markets? The fed yield inflation, tariffs, it all seems to be kind of tumbling together at once. 00:46:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I have to say 2025 has been a tough year for anyone and it’s also been a tough year candidly for me to start a new job. I like to say that every time I start a new job there’s some big volatility event. This one might be the biggest and frankly totally self-induced as opposed to some kind of exogenous or external shock. So it’s been really difficult to navigate through this market and yet, you know, there are some things we can still anchor to paying attention to what companies are saying about their businesses. This kind of sort of sentiment stuff we were talking about a moment ago. Looking at the long-term trends, this all leads us to say like okay, we can still be invested. But I am deeply worried Barry about what’s gonna happen to the economy over the summer and and into the beginning of 2026. 00:47:05 We know that companies have been operating more or less BAU business as usual despite all of the shocks on headlines around tariffs and consumers, you know, may have pulled forward some demand, but they’re also kind of operating BAU for the most part. There’s not been a significant change. And yet we know that the introduction of these tariffs and the risk aversion that’s a result of these tariffs and changes in policy and changes in expectations for global supply chains is going to lead to some weakness and activity. The thing I just wanna point out is like going into the end of 2024, in the beginning of 25, I was also like a little worried frankly that the economy was slowing not catastrophically, not recession style, but there were enough cracks across the consumer and enough indications from companies to basically suggest like this was not gonna be an accelerating year even before these policy shocks. 00:48:01 And now I think despite some adjustments, you know, immediately after the tariff announcements, companies don’t have an incentive to do a bunch of different things. And that is engage in real CapEx, they’ll spend what they need to to stay in business or to maintain or things that are absolutely necessary, but they’re gonna prioritize expansionary CapEx and acquisitions I think are off the table. Number two on the labor market. We’ve heard a lot of people talk about it being frozen. Yes there’s still some hiring, but when you look at kind of the composition of the hiring, it’s not as exciting as it might have otherwise been in a, you know, policy, you risk free economy and I think companies have an incentive to kind of keep their labor force where it is without really expanding. ’cause they don’t know if that’s gonna make sense for margins and stuff going forward. 00:48:51 And then the third thing I would say is, you know, companies need to ask themselves what should my supply chain, what should my corporate relationships look like over the course of, you know, the next couple years? Because the truth of the matter is if they have to realign ’em, it will be a significant cost. It will take a ton of time and take a ton of energy. And yet if there might be a policy shift either at the midterms or under a new administration, the incentive to make these multi-year investments as low. So I get this sort of paralysis that’s playing out in terms of the market in, in terms of corporate behavior. And so I’m a little, I wouldn’t say worried about a recession, but concerned about much slower activity in the second half of the year. 00:49:35 [Speaker Changed] So that raises so many different issues. We keep hearing from CFOs, CEOs about the lack of clarity. If you don’t know what the policy’s gonna be, how do you relocate manufacturing plan a headquarter? How do you plan to do any sort of expansionary hiring? So I’m completely with you that hey, this seems to be this self-inflicted wound that’s preventing the economy from accelerating and yet despite all that the economy seems to be incredibly resilient and not taking too big of a hit from all of these on again off again tariffs. Does that just mean that this administration inherited a really robust economy? 00:50:23 [Speaker Changed] Yes, and I think there’s another element to it. I do think this administration, you know, inherited a resilient economy. One that was perhaps underappreciated over the last couple years because not everyone was feeling that resilience in the same way or wealth creation wasn’t as broad as some would’ve liked. Okay. But I think there’s another element to this too, and this goes a little bit into kind of corporate behavior and how investors react to corporate decisions. Which is, you know, if a company pulls back prematurely, let’s say they shed a bunch of workforce or they cut a lot of CapEx and they really hunker down for a bad economic environment and that doesn’t actually show up for multiple quarters and they la 00:51:08 [Speaker Changed] Kinda like the past few years. Yeah. Everybody forecasting recessions that never came 00:51:12 [Speaker Changed] And they lag their peer group and they look weak relative to the rest of the industry. Wow. That, that makes people lose confidence in that management team. Hmm. So there’s almost an incentive for management teams to maybe have contingency plans to talk about that with their board and the rest of their leadership, but not necessarily communicate that with the investment community and keep operating with only a tiny bit of defensive action because there’s gonna be a penalty on their stock price and frankly in the confidence people have in the management team, if it looks like they’re being too emotional and reactionary. 00:51:48 [Speaker Changed] This sounds like the game theory work you did at UFC Yeah is coming into the 00:51:52 [Speaker Changed] Before a a hundred percent that that it plays a huge part in the way I think about this. So you know, no company has an incentive to talk about how concerned they actually are publicly because the first one that does it will be penalized. 00:52:05 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That’s interesting. And, and since you work at a giant bank, we’ve seen bank earnings that are pretty strong across the board. Yeah. That’s kind of unexpected. Tell us a little bit about what does that mean in light of this environment? Relatively high rates really just more normalized than what we’ve seen in the prior two decades. What’s going on in the banking sector? 00:52:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, well I can talk a little bit about Citi because we’ve had some pretty awesome operating performance and there are a couple things really driving that. Of course, you know, there’s been a real focus in terms of cost and expense. This is not just Citi, this is across the board at major financial institutions and frankly investment investors really love this. They want to see that discipline continue. Number two, like the mix shift has actually contributed to earnings. And I think as you well know, you know, wealth has been a huge driver for many of the diversified financial services companies. I expect it con will continue and I’m looking forward to wealth being an even bigger driver for Citi over the next couple years. And then I think there’s a, you know, another element too, which is that the speed and sort of the, the facility that management has in toggling between different types of business for different parts of the cycle has significantly improved relative to how people think about banks 15 years ago. So we were talking about valuations earlier and you know, financial services and kind of banks more specifically kind of dragged down overall market multiples when they were a huge part of the market cap for the US large cap indices in the past. 00:53:39 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about soft data. It’s kind of been negative when we’re talking about sentiment and things like that. This really hasn’t translated into the hard data yet. Tell us what you’re looking at in that space. 00:53:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, of course. I mean, I’m shaking my head as you say that ’cause it’s absolutely right. The soft data into hard data in a normal period, you know, gets translated in in over inconsistent time period. So there’s not like a map that says like, hey, the soft data does x and then three quarters later or one month later it translates into something in the market or some other hard data and economic activity. So it’s always a bit of an art interpreting the soft data into the hard data. And yet it’s really important to, to pay attention because it may impact the marginal decision. Right now the soft data has went from catastrophic post the April 2nd to tariff announcements to really awful, to maybe a hair better, but still pretty bummed out. And as we’ve talked about, the economic data has stayed somewhat resilient. That doesn’t mean that the economic data will never show weakness. And again, I’m expecting some soft pockets throughout the second half of the year. Not recessionary, but kind of like sub 2% sub one point half percent growth. I think we should buckle down for, and that’s where I expect more durable earning stories. Secular growth stories will outperform the rest of the market. 00:55:06 [Speaker Changed] So it sounds like there are a couple of catalysts in the pipeline and you’re just waiting to see which direction the majority of these go. Tell us a little bit about what you see is upside and downsized. 00:55:18 [Speaker Changed] Catalysts. Okay. So around tariffs, any given day that we’d be having this discussion, there would be, there’s a new set of news. One thing I do know is that we have a series of deadlines over the course of the summer where people are hoping for some level of resolution. And the way I say talk about this, Barry, is this, is that we may be past peak tar of shock, but we are nowhere close to peak tariff pain. We don’t really know how bad it’s going to be quite yet. And this is why of course companies have been reluctant to significantly change their guidance and their earnings revision ratios have looked, you know, better than some people expected. Here’s what I will say. Even if the reciprocal tariffs don’t hold up and they end up going to the Supreme Court and that’s a decision, the sectoral tariffs which take longer to implement are much stickier and frankly have much long larger. 00:56:09 [Speaker Changed] When you say sectoral like North America Canon? 00:56:12 [Speaker Changed] No, like semis. 00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] Oh, okay. Gotcha. Pharma, 00:56:16 [Speaker Changed] Copper, steel, all of these sectoral tariffs are much stickier and have much greater potential impact than the country to country bilateral reciprocal tariffs. 00:56:28 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s so interesting you mentioned that someone was from a biomedical device company was having a conversation with me. It’s like I don’t understand an iPhone is exempt from China tariffs, but the pacemakers we make that save people’s lives are not, and if we have to relocate this to wherever, to Taiwan, to Vietnam, to Canada, right? The FDA process starts over and it’ll be eight years. So for about half a decade or so, as the the Chinese manufacturer at pacemakers sell off, but before the new ones come online, there’s not gonna be enough pacemakers 00:57:07 [Speaker Changed] Right there. We have a real risk of some of these important raw materials and these important consumer goods and these important medical goods, you know, not being adequately supplied. And so we have to really watch this. So I, so I will say this, that the tariff side is not gonna be resolved over the course of the summer and because it’s gonna bleed out for longer, we may have slower growth, but not catastrophic. But eventually we’ll have some really big sectoral consumer and business impacts. 00:57:36 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really interesting. You mentioned some of the news stories and how things are affecting sentiment. How do you see the role of narratives driving market responses? It seems like there are different stories for different asset classes every other week. 00:57:54 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. The narrative changes. It sometimes it feels like on 30 minute increments, it, you know, it used to be you’d have a couple weeks of a narrative taking hold. I know many people think about this, but the market can really only focus on one thing at a time, one major narrative at a time. You know, and that’s where you end up seeing the bulk of the price movement. For example, is it around tariffs? Is it around inflation data? Is it around fed expectations? Is it around the technology conflict between the US and China? Is it around some geopolitical shock? You know, it’s, but it’s not gonna be all of those things at once, even though I would argue all of those things are happening concurrently. And I think the market has become even more short attention span if we can, you know, personify it here. And as a result, the narratives are shifting very quickly. This is why it’s really important to, when you’re thinking about portfolio construction, to anchor on the right asset class and factor exposures, to layer it with more sort of medium term thematic alpha generating ideas and then offer some ballast to the portfolio, either in less correlated assets or in expressions of the asset class or factor that that has a different duration. So, 00:59:07 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about some of the quote unquote less correlated asset classes. There has been a giant move into alternatives, most especially private credit, private equity. What do you see in that space? How is that evolving over the next five to 10 years? 00:59:25 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, let me answer that second part first. I think the evolution of this, this broad bucket of alternatives is gonna be towards more liquid expressions. 00:59:34 [Speaker Changed] More liquid, yes. 00:59:36 [Speaker Changed] Or at least more vehicles that allow for individual investors and, you know, family offices and things like that to invest in these types of vehicles. Right? You don’t have to set it and forget it for like 10 years. I think there’s gonna be a lot of demand just as we’ve seen say traditional mutual fund transfer into ETFs, active ETFs, but be more kind of combined vehicles. The challenge I think is that there’s been so much money, and we know this, we’ve got great data on this chasing this like a small number of deals. And it has become so popular to think about alternatives as an asset class that the returns that some of these strategies have been able to achieve in the past, I think are much more challenged in the future. 01:00:21 [Speaker Changed] Ha Haven’t we seen that in sort of venture capital land? Absolutely. Back in the absolutely the eighties and nineties VC numbers were spectacular. And post.com implosion. Yeah. Not only you have more companies staying private for longer, it just seems like a ton of low hanging fruit were picked, you know, decades ago. Yeah. 01:00:39 [Speaker Changed] The narrative is like 85% of US companies are actually still private. And so it’s really important to have all these vehicles to access them on the equity on the credit side. I hear that. But there’s certain major differences. Of course, if you’re a private company, you may continue to need different types of funding. You don’t have to disclose to your shareholders on a regular basis, of course, that you don’t have to deal with the, the stock price fluctuation and, and all of that, what that might mean for your employees who are paid and, and shares. But it also creates a complicated environment where when you don’t have to disclose, when you don’t have to report, you know, you may make a different set of decisions. Some of that might be good for the long term and some of it may be just like a poor allocation of capital. ’cause no one’s calling you out on it because the capital’s already locked in. So it’s, I would say this 85% of companies that are still private, that the alternative managers are exciting about, about giving you exposure to not all of them are the same quality as the, you know, publicly available, you know, large cap, mega cap companies. 01:01:46 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense. I want to get to my favorite questions. Okay. But before I do that, I gotta throw you at least one curve ball. You are on the resource council for the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. Yeah. Tell us about that. Does 01:01:59 [Speaker Changed] That sound random to you, 01:02:00 [Speaker Changed] Barry? Yeah, it sounds totally ra I know you’re a former ski bum. I am. So maybe there’s some relationship with that. Yeah, I 01:02:08 [Speaker Changed] Actually split my time between New York City and Jackson Hole. So I spent a lot of time in the Jackson community. I’m super passionate about the conservation and nature programs at Grand Teton National Park. And I’ve been on the Resource council now for about three years. It is a kind of sub-board of the, of the board of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. And we do some really amazing things. One of the things I’m most passionate about are some of these wildlife programs and the money that we raise specifically for research that benefits some of the biologists in the park and also that, you know, all of the visitors to the park can take advantage of. My favorite thing to do every summer, Barry is the Wolf Watch, which we do some, some days during August, we’ll go up with a biologist to this bluff and we will watch a, a pack that lives in Grand Teton National Park and learn all about wolf habitats behaviors and changes in their patterns. 01:03:04 [Speaker Changed] So, so this is part of the National Park system, but yet there’s a private foundation that helps raise assets and manage resources for the park. Tell us a little bit about that 01:03:15 [Speaker Changed] Structure. Yeah, actually, almost all the national parks have friends groups. And this Grant Teton National Park Foundation is the friends group for Grand Teton National Park. We are a very large and successful one and we’ve really helped to partner with the park on everything from like visitor centers to, you know, accessible options to the, to rivers, to redoing the trail system, to sponsoring some of the biologists, et cetera. The park is run by the park, but the superintendent and the CEO Grant Teton National Park Foundation are close partners. And I like to think, yeah, we’re the best friends group out there. 01:03:47 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really quite fascinating. Let’s jump to our favorite questions ’cause I only, I know I only have you for a few more moments. We’ll, we’ll make this our speed round. Starting with what’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you watching or listening to? 01:04:03 [Speaker Changed] Okay, so I don’t watch television at all very infrequently. 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] No Netflix, no prime, no Apple tv, none of that. 01:04:10 [Speaker Changed] It’s not really my jam. Wow, 01:04:12 [Speaker Changed] That’s really 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] Interesting. Yeah, it’s not really my jam. I do watch like things, sometimes a news magazine or whatever, but for the most part I’m just an avid reader and I like to spend my time when I’m not working, reading, playing sports, listening to music, and I’m an amateur artist, so I’ve been watching screens after being in front of screens all day long is unappealing to me. 01:04:35 [Speaker Changed] Can I tell you that sounds shockingly healthy. 01:04:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I try to be shockingly healthy. I also try to put my devices down and be focused on other things because I get enough screen time during the day. 01:04:46 [Speaker Changed] I, I totally get it. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 01:04:52 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know that I had a lot of official mentors. I will tell you, I had more peer mentors, if that makes sense. You know, growing up in the business, I, I was often the only woman in the room, or the only woman on the investment committee. And I built really strong peer relationships with other investors of similar levels around the street. And there are a lot of people who’ve helped to influence my way of thinking or have challenged me. But yeah, I mean, I try and be a mentor to as many, especially young women as I can in the business since I didn’t have that available to me at the time. But I wish I had a long list of mentors, but I would say it’s, it’s more my peer group that I’ve really linked arms with and grown with that I think of as kind of playing that role for me in my career. 01:05:37 [Speaker Changed] Huh, interesting. So you mentioned you read a lot. Let’s talk about books. Yeah. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:05:44 [Speaker Changed] Okay. I’m a giant sci-fi in fantasy nerd. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] Oh boy. Were you talking to the right person? 01:05:49 [Speaker Changed] I mean, so on this theme of not watching screens after I work, I like to really escape, like deep in escape after a long day of staring at numbers and analyzing, you know, economics. So here’s what I will say. I am in an amazing series right now, the Murder Bot series by Martha Wells. I know it’s been made into a series. I will not watch it because it will ruin the entire vision. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] It’s on Apple tv. It’s gotten mixed reviews so far. Yeah, so far. But I have that in my queue, the first murder box. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it’s so good. It’s amazing. And you know, thinking about this intersection between bots and AI and the future, and there’s a lot of inner dialogue in there that I don’t think will translate well into a series. But anyway, neither here nor there. So I love to read that before I, I’m on book six now. Before I started that I read the latest from Town of French, which is called the Searcher and, and that and the Hunters two books together, it takes place in Ireland. She’s one of my favorite contemporary fiction authors. It’s like, these are mysteries. And so I love that. And yeah, I pretty much gobble up anything that will make it onto the Hugo or Nebula shortlist. Right. And try and geek out as much as possible. 01:07:05 [Speaker Changed] I had no idea you were a geek. Any non-fiction that that crosses your transom? 01:07:10 [Speaker Changed] Well, the one that’s really kind of stood out to me, and it was recommended by a former colleague of mine from BlackRock is 4,000 weeks. 01:07:17 [Speaker Changed] So good. 01:07:18 [Speaker Changed] So good. And as someone who’s tried to optimize my life many times in the past, but have had a couple he health setbacks and things like that, this was a great reminder that getting through the to to-do list is not the goal. 01:07:31 [Speaker Changed] Right. Oliver, Oliver Burke, something like that. 01:07:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:07:34 [Speaker Changed] The, the line that I remember from that book was 4,000 weeks is about 80 years is human lifespan. Yeah. Human life is insultingly brief. Yes. And that phrase just stood out. 01:07:48 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And this idea that we are all, every day approaching our death is actually empowering. Yes. Instead of discouraging. If you know that you don’t have infant time, you make better decisions. Frankly, 01:08:02 [Speaker Changed] Scarcity is an important economic thesis. 01:08:05 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But you cut out the stuff that’s not important and you focus on the things and the people and the experiences that are, and anyway, I love this book. 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, I totally agree. Final two questions. Yeah. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career of, normally I would say whatever the person’s specific specialty is, but you’ve done so much across consulting and strategy and buy side and sell side and hedge funds and portfolio management, and now chief investment strategy. Someone interested in just finance or wealth management. 01:08:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I would say the most important thing is to keep an open mind. One of the most frustrating things, you know, young graduates and even young graduates from business school or or other graduate programs, is that they have like a path in mind. You know, in three or five years I expect to be here in 10 years. And I say keep an open mind because there’s so much disruption and so much change across these industries. You can’t have a mapped out plan. Your goal is to be a sponge and to learn and learn and learn, and also to be patient. Honestly, Barry, I’d say this a lot because you know, you get some like really smart 23, 24, 20 8-year-old who you know, wants to find out what’s over the next hill. And I wanna remind them, you know, if the actuarial tables are even somewhat right, they have 70 more years of life ahead of them. I think that’s right. And they don’t need to rush. They can enjoy the moment of learning, enjoy the experience, and understanding that not just, they’ll have the opportunity to pivot. They’ll have the mandate to pivot. As you know, industries get disrupted and technology evolves. Huh. 01:09:43 [Speaker Changed] Fascinating. And our final question. Yeah. What is it that you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew 25, 30 years ago when you were first getting started? 01:09:54 [Speaker Changed] I thought there was a more systematic way to approach investing when I first started, you know, close to three decades ago. And now I understand that true investing is both art and science. Maybe that’s the reason why I think I’ll stay in this business for the rest of my life because I’m constantly intellectually challenged to not get frustrated if a model doesn’t work out. In fact, sometimes the process of going through creating a model or a piece of analysis or going down a rabbit hole in research that doesn’t yield anything this year may actually be really helpful for me in three years, or help to reframe my thought process. So understanding that it’s not perfect and that it’s art and science. 01:10:33 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. Thanks Kate for being so generous with your time.

Title: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum’s smart-contract platform has crossed a major line. According to data shared by Token Terminal on X, the total value of tokenized assets on Ethereum now tops $6 billion. That figure covers products from asset managers, fund houses and blockchain firms. It proves institutions are treating on‑chain finance as more than a tech demo. BlackRock leads the pack. The world’s largest asset manager holds the biggest share of tokenized AUM on Ethereum. Close behind are Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Superstate, Apollo and Ondo Finance. Franklin Templeton focused on parts of its US Government Money Fund. WisdomTree launched funds you can buy through a mobile app. Superstate and Apollo each add smaller but steady sums. Based on reports, these six names together make up most of the $6 billion milestone. Tokenized AUM on @ethereum is at an all-time high World’s biggest financial services firms & asset managers are tokenizing assets on Ethereum pic.twitter.com/5Xl4XXYQ3O — Token Terminal 📊 (@tokenterminal) July 6, 2025 The climb didn’t happen in a day. Adoption started slowly around mid‑2023. It rose further in early 2024. Then by January 2025, the line on the stacked chart shot straight up. That jump comes as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton pour in fresh tokens. Faster trades and fewer middlemen are big draws. Trades that once took days can now settle in minutes or seconds. That kind of speed appeals to big investors, who want clarity and a clear audit trail. This push into tokenized finance shows a shift in how big firms manage money. Ethereum still faces questions about scaling. If gas fees jump again, trading costs could rise sharply. Regulators in the US, Europe and Asia have yet to set clear rules. A clampdown in one region might push firms toward other chains or private blockchains. Competition from Solana, Avalanche and new networks is already heating up. With $6 billion on‑chain, tokenized assets are past the trial stage. More firms will likely join once rules firm up and scaling solutions roll out. Markets could see new fund types, cross‑border trades and on‑chain yield tools. For now, Ethereum holds the lead. Yet the next hurdles—fee pressure, rule making and rival chains—will test whether it can keep growing. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Government approves establishment of commission of inquiry into historic sexual abuse in schools
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/07/08/government-approves-establishment-of-commission-of-inquiry-into-historic-sexual-abuse-in-schools/
Time Published: 2025-07-08T12:17:32Z
Full Content:
The Government will “pursue all levers available” to compel the religious orders to pay redress to victims of historic sex abuse in schools, the Minister for Education Helen McEntee has stated. A commission of inquiry into allegations of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools has been established by the Government with a time frame to report within five years. Speaking after the commission was approved by the Cabinet, Ms McEntee said any redress due to the victims arising out of the commission should be paid for by the religious orders. The compensation will be a “measure of accountability” for what happened to victims. This will include looking at changes to the statute of limitations on civil claims and changes to the status of unincorporated associations, as well as looking at the assets that religious orders have. An examination of how to get compensation from religious orders will run in parallel with the commission of investigation. The Attorney General Rossa Fanning and his office has been involved in drawing up proposals to pursue the religious orders for money. Successive governments have had little success in pursuing religious orders for compensation. A deal made in 2002 that capped contributions from the religious orders at €128 million – less than 10 per cent of the eventual compensation liability – was widely criticised. The religious orders fell short of the 50:50 split in relation to the 2009 Ryan Report and only two religious orders out of eight offered redress to survivors of mother and baby homes. On foot of that failure, the Minister for Children Norma Foley asked the Attorney General to examine ways that might lead to the sequestration of assets or the seizing or freezing of bank accounts of religious orders. When asked how the Government plans to improve on collecting money from the religious orders, she said: “There is more work that needs to be done to find out exactly what is owned and is in the possession of the religious orders or institutions. “It is clear that any redress scheme approved by Government will have to be funded by these religious organisations.” Under the terms of reference of the report, which were published on Tuesday, Mr Justice Michael MacGrath must report within five years – and write to the Minister for Education within two years, updating her as to the likelihood of meeting that target. The commission will begin its work in October and Ms McEntee said the cost of it is likely to “run into tens of millions of euro”. [ Schools sexual abuse inquiry: It was open season on children’s bodies. These men did what they likedOpens in new window ] Labour has brought forward a Bill that would remove legal obstacles to the Government forcing the religious orders to pay redress. “These orders cannot be allowed to hide behind trusts and legal mechanisms to avoid accountability,” Labour leader Ivana Bacik said. “This legislation provides a clear and immediate pathway to justice, and Government should support its passage without delay . . . Survivors have waited long enough.” Abuse survivors’ support organisation One in Four said it welcomed Tuesday’s news. Chief executive Deirdre Kenny said the commission’s scale “reflects the thousands of lives affected and the deep impact on families and communities for generations”. However, the group said it is “concerned that the issue of redress will be further delayed. While we appreciate this is complex, survivors have shown immense resilience and patience; therefore, we are concerned about any further delay. Delays disadvantage survivors and may allow institutions to avoid accountability and responsibility.” Last September, the then government formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools, following recommendations in the 700-page scoping inquiry report, led by Mary O’Toole SC. The report disclosed 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by religious congregations, involving 884 alleged abusers. A high number of allegations were concentrated in special education schools, where 590 allegations were recorded in 17 institutions involving 190 alleged abusers. [ ‘Their childhood stopped the day the abuse started’: Almost 2,400 allegations of abuse in religious run-schoolsOpens in new window ] The inquiry was set up following revelations of widespread sexual abuse of boys at Willow Park and Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It followed the broadcast of RTÉ radio documentary Blackrock Boys in November 2022 and the launch that month also of a restorative justice programme involving abuse survivors and the Spiritan congregation, which runs the schools. There will be a sampling approach used – whereby cases will be chosen that have sufficient witnesses and documentary evidence available to allow the commission to fulfil its functions. An initial survey will be undertaken to identify the potential number of survivors.

US stock market steadied Tuesday as Trump's tariff deadline delay gave investors hope for new global trade deals. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures showed modest movement after Trump extended the July 9 tariff start date to August 1, offering trading partners more time to negotiate. Countries like South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia now have breathing space to respond. While markets remain cautious, the delay sparked optimism that Trump’s firm-yet-flexible stance may open the door for diplomatic progress. Investors now await the Fed minutes and Delta’s earnings to see what’s next for the economy.

July 08, 2025 07:34 ET | Source: CC Capital; ReserveOne Inc. CC Capital; ReserveOne Inc. NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ReserveOne Inc. (“ReserveOne”), a newly formed, first-of-its-kind digital asset management firm inspired by the proposed U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, today announced it has entered into a definitive business combination agreement with M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp. (NASDAQ: MBAVU, MBAV, MBAVW) (“M3-Brigade”), a special purpose acquisition company.

Title: The Democratization Of Wall Street: AI Trading For All

ByDouglas B. Laney ByDouglas B. Laney, Contributor. AI and man superimposed looking at a stock chart It’s 1988, and somewhere in New York, a young financial analyst named Larry Fink is nursing a bruised ego and a $100 million loss. That catastrophic trade at First Boston would haunt him, but also sparked an obsession that would quietly reshape global finance. Fink's solution was to build a sophisticated AI system to prevent such disasters. He called it Aladdin. Fast-forward nearly four decades, and that same system now manages over $20 trillion in assets, roughly 7% of the world's financial wealth. BlackRock's Aladdin has become the invisible hand guiding institutional investment decisions worldwide. Today, BlackRock expects the AI boom to continue boosting U.S. stocks throughout the year, despite concerns about debt and global uncertainty clouding the outlook. The firm is betting big on AI-driven market rallies, and now individual investors can finally join that bet with tools that were unattainable, if entirely unimaginable, just a decade ago. Today, however, AI-driven approaches are finally reaching retail traders and testing Wall Street's hegemony. Some entrepreneurs saw this democratization coming years before others. TechBerry, a Germany-based trading company, began developing AI-driven trading models in 2014, launching commercially in 2015 just as the enterprise AI revolution was in its infancy. Its concept and timing both proved prescient. While institutional giants were tuning their systems for trillion-dollar portfolios, TechBerry's founders saw gaping market whitespace for individual investors. "Our biggest challenge was assembling a top-tier team of experts to build a unique AI model back in 2014, when the industry was just emerging," said Techberry CEO, Bruno Baily. "We had to do it with limited personal investment since investors showed little interest in our startup back then. Quite a contrast to the attention we receive today." As early movers in this space, they demonstrated that AI trading could be effective at scale beyond institutional walls. While institutions focused on managing trillions of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, an enormous underserved market of individual traders was left wanting for similar sets of tools. Unlike the perfunctory AI solutions that many fintech companies were peddling (basically repackaged algorithms with flashy interfaces), TechBerry invested in building what it claims is the world’s largest dataset of historical trades. Its platform now counts over 110,000 active traders, creating network effects that improve performance for everyone involved. This trader dataset creates genuine competitive moats in ways that traditional Wall Street firms struggle to replicate. Techberry CEO, Bruno Bailey Two years after TechBerry launched, Larry Fink saw the writing on the wall. "We have to change the ecosystem. That means relying more on big data, artificial intelligence, factors, and models within quant and traditional investment strategies," he declared to The New York Times in 2017. He doubled down: "BlackRock must bet big on the power of machines, be it Aladdin, the firm's risk management platform, robo-advisers, big data, and artificial intelligence." Fink wasn't just describing BlackRock's future. He was validating what TechBerry had already understood: AI would fundamentally rewire investment management. But while TechBerry was building for individual traders, the institutional world had been operating with this advantage for decades. Aladdin's Monte Carlo simulations can stress-test portfolios against a range of scenarios, from government collapses to global pandemics. For the longest time, this kind of technological firepower remained locked away in institutional vaults. During the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, while retail investors scrambled with basic tools and gut instincts, big corporations and government agencies had Aladdin whispering market secrets in their ears. The exclusivity wasn't accidental. Building these systems required the kind of capital and expertise that only the largest financial institutions could muster. The barriers to entry seemed insurmountable for anyone operating outside the institutional ecosystem. What sets TechBerry apart from the typical Silicon Valley AI narrative is its European perspective on technology and regulation. Operating from Germany within the EU's strict financial services framework while serving a global user base, they've built compliance into their DNA rather than treating it as an afterthought. This regulatory-first approach has paid dividends in credibility. TechBerry’s performance has been verified by independent third-party auditing services, including FXAudit and Myfxtools, which have shown verified monthly returns of 11%. This transparency was virtually unheard of in retail AI trading just a few years ago. For decades, retail traders have been burned by systems that worked boffo in backtests but crumbled under real market conditions. Thankfully, third-party auditing provided the kind of institutional-grade accountability that retail trading has desperately needed. Democratization genuinely levels the playing field. TechBerry's approach shows how real-time information from a broad base of investors can create entirely new competitive advantages, rather than simply copying institutional playbooks. Its expansive trader network generates fresh data continuously, potentially offering insights that even established institutions might lack. While systems like Aladdin excel at institutional portfolio management, platforms like TechBerry can tap into the collective intelligence of thousands of individual traders putting their own money on the line. That's a fundamentally different and potentially equally valuable dataset. Instead of top-down institutional wisdom, you get bottom-up market intelligence from people with skin in the game. The trend toward sophisticated trading algorithms becoming accessible to individual investors shows no signs of slowing. TechBerry plans to expand its AI model into cryptocurrency trading, potentially bringing institutional-grade analysis to one of the most volatile and retail-dominated markets. Their goal of growing its trader base to 200,000 suggests confidence that AI democratization can scale without compromising performance. The broader implications are staggering. If AI trading becomes truly democratized, will it level the playing field or simply create new advantages for early adopters? The evidence so far suggests both outcomes are possible, but companies like TechBerry are proving that individual investors no longer need to accept second-class citizenship in the world of algorithmic trading. What seems certain is that the exclusive club of AI-powered trading is rapidly expanding. The same sophisticated analysis that once required institutional resources is becoming available to anyone with internet access and modest capital. When a European AI-driven startup can deliver serious returns through democratized data and analytics, it signals that the barriers may be crumbling faster than anticipated. As Larry Fink predicted back in 2017, the ecosystem is evolving rapidly. While BlackRock continues to bet on AI-driven market growth, individual investors can place similar bets using similar tools. The question isn’t whether AI will transform trading for individual investors, it’s how quickly they’ll adapt to this new ascendancy.

Title: Tesla’s troubles are deeper than you think | CNN Business

Time Published: 2025-07-08T11:23:43Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Tesla’s troubles go far beyond CEO Elon Musk’s recent dust-up with President Donald Trump, who accused the former “first buddy” of going “completely ‘off the rails’” in a social media slap fight over the weekend. But while the battles between Musk and Trump are getting all the attention, the outlook for Tesla’s revenue and bottom line have gotten notably worse. And the company could even be back to losing money, for reasons unrelated to Musk’s personal politics. Musk was Trump’s largest financial supporter during the 2024 campaign, and was a mainstay at Mar-a-Lago and the White House at the start of Trump’s second term, with his role in slashing the federal workforce at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But Musk has since announced he was starting a new political party due to his displeasure with the tax and spending bill signed by Trump on Friday — and the barbs on their respective websites have only increased since then. Shares of Tesla closed Monday down 6.8%, as investors were concerned about the implication of Musk’s latest political moves, despite his promises to re-focus on the company. It rebounded only 1.3% in Tuesday trading. “Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who’s known for being optimistic about the company. Ives put out a follow-up note Tuesday saying that the Tesla board should set ground rules to limit Musk’s political activities because the company is at a “tipping point” for its future. “Tesla is heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle with the autonomous and robotics future now on the doorstep and cannot have Musk spending more and more time creating a political party which will require countless time, energy, and political capital,” he wrote. Still, Ives maintained his buy recommendation and $500 price target for the stock in his note. But analysts at William Blair cut their recommendation on the stock to “market perform” or neutral, and also cut their earnings forecast for the company. Because even without the political stink, the Tesla’s financial outlook is suddenly looking notably worse. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. But when Ives posted his belief that the Tesla board should tie Musk’s future pay package to the amount of time he spends at Tesla and have oversight of his political “endeavors,” Musk responded with his own post on X, saying “Shut up, Dan.” Blair’s note pointed out that Trump’s bill not only removed the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle (EV) buyers, but also eliminated the financial penalties for automakers that fail to meet federal emissions targets. Emissions fines have historically forced automakers who still build primarily gasoline powered cars and trucks to buy “regulatory credits” from EV companies. Removing those fines eliminates “market demand for Tesla’s credits,” said the note from William Blair analysts Jed Dorsheimer and Mark Shooter. The sale of those federal and state credits added $10.6 billion to Tesla’s bottom line since 2019 and often enabled the company to post a profit. Without the revenue from those regulatory credits, the company would not have reported a positive annual net income until 2021, and it would have been back in the red again in the first quarter of this year, when its net income plunged 71% compared to a year earlier on sharply lower sales around the globe. Musk has largely downplayed all the recent bad news, saying the company’s future rests on robots, artificial intelligence and self-driving taxis. But the company’s taxi service is very limited to date, launching only in Austin, Texas, for a select group of customers – mostly Tesla fans – and with a Tesla employee riding in the front passenger seat to monitor the car’s performance. That puts Tesla behind the robotaxi service already offered in Austin and three other cities – San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix – by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet. And Tesla’s rollout has had its shares of problems, including a video showing a robotaxi traveling on the wrong side of the road for about half of a block and another video of a robotaxi slowly turning its front wheels into a parked car. While Musk has promised his robotaxi service will be expanding soon across many other cities, he has not given any further details. He also hasn’t said when the Austin service will be expanded to the general public, nor when the company’s human monitors sitting in the front passenger seat will no longer be needed. Meanwhile, Waymo has definitive plans to expand its service to Miami and Washington, DC, next year in partnership with Uber. “We expect that investors are growing tired of the distraction at a point when the business needs Musk’s attention the most and only see downside from his dip back into politics,” said the William Blair note. “We would prefer this effort to be channeled towards the robotaxi rollout at this critical juncture.” Then there’s the problem of Tesla’s sales. Or rather, the lack thereof. Global sales were down a record 13% in each of the first two quarters of this year, compared to a year earlier, even though demand for EVs overall continues to climb, a further sign of Tesla’s declining market share. Part of the lost EV market share is due to increased competition, both from Western automakers rolling out their own EV offerings, and Chinese automakers that have made a massive push into the market. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to surpass Tesla in global annual EV sales this year for the first time, even though Tesla is a still a major player in China, and BYDs are not sold in the US. Demand is likely to weaken further come October 1, when the $7,500 tax credit for electric car buyers expires. When a previous version of the tax credit was phased out for Teslas in 2019, the company had to cut the price of the car by about half the value of the lost credit. Tuesday Tesla posted on X that “If there ever was a time to yolo your car purchase, it’s now,” referencing the upcoming tax credit expiration and using the acronym for “you only live once.” But Tesla has also faced missteps of Musk’s own doing. There has been backlash against Musk’s political activity, which has had a significant impact on Tesla sales. That is likely to continue even as he moves to distance himself from Trump. In the early months of this year, hundreds of protests were held outside Tesla showrooms in the United States, Canada and Europe. Worries about self-inflicted brand damage started the company’s shares on their downward slide. It prompted Trump, who was still Musk’s ally at the time, to announce he was buying a Tesla for himself. In March, the president hosted an event at the White House urging others to buy the company’s cars. At one point, Musk and Tesla investors might have hoped that in a closely divided country, the lost sales to Trump critics might be at least partly made up for by sales to Trump fans. But Musk seems to now face the possibility of backlash from both sides of the political spectrum. “He’s been able to alienate everyone, which many thought was impossible, but he’s actually been able to do it,” Ives told CNN Monday. “And the problem is, this soap opera just keeps going on.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Feedback Loops, Not Dashboards, Drive Real CX Insights

Time Published: 2025-07-08T11:23:32Z

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Metrics miss why. Behavioral data tracks what happened, but it rarely explains why customers act or leave. Feedback loops fill in those gaps. Ask, act, announce. Closing the loop requires three steps. Ask customers, act on input, and announce what changed. Most firms stop after the first step. Feedback builds trust. People don’t resist sharing opinions. They resist being ignored. Timely follow-up turns feedback into trust and stronger retention. Companies track click-through rates, build dashboards of behavioral data and run attribution models. Yet, many skip the simplest step of asking customers what they think. This habit reflects the deeper problem of metric fixation. Leaders chase numbers that are easy to collect, but those figures rarely explain why people buy, stay or leave. Studies show response rates for large federal surveys have fallen from 70% to under 40%, and executives point to “survey fatigue” as proof that asking questions no longer works. That excuse hides the real issue. People are not tired of sharing opinions; they are tired of feeling ignored. When feedback disappears into a black hole, trust erodes. When companies listen and act, participation rebounds. In other words, the flaw is not in asking but in how businesses treat the answers. This breakdown reveals the missing piece and shows how firms that close the feedback loop outperform those that only track clicks. We’ll cover shifting market trends, examine a real-world turnaround and end with a step-by-step plan you can use now. This will help you understand why moving from passive metrics to active conversation helps you measure what truly matters and build relationships that last. Companies that master feedback do not send longer surveys. They design shorter, smarter questions, time them to key moments and, most importantly, show customers how their comments drive change. The payoff is clear. It’s higher retention, stronger lifetime value and a culture that values listening over guessing. Most organizations rely on indirect signals to gauge engagement. They watch open rates, dwell time, net promoter scores and conversion funnels. Then they infer satisfaction from the movement of those lines. This approach feels scientific, but it hides three big flaws. Understanding the trade-offs between behavioral data and direct feedback reveals why active loops drive deeper insight and action. Amperity's 2024 analysis of global consumer retail and hospitality brands found that companies misidentify 23% of their most valuable customers, the very individuals responsible for over half their revenue. They focus on surface-level optimizations like faster page load times or shorter forms, yet customer defection continues. That is because behavioral data only reveals what has already happened. Cart abandonment or subscription cancellation becomes visible only after the damage is done. Direct questions, on the other hand, uncover intent earlier, before disengagement turns into loss. TruRating, a customer feedback platform, specializes in capturing simple, targeted feedback at the point of payment by asking just one question during checkout. This minimalist approach has proven highly effective, and it delivers response rates of over 80% in-store and 50% online. The results speak for themselves. TruRating clients have reported revenue increases of up to 8% after implementing changes based on the insights gathered. With more than 500 million pieces of customer feedback as of 2023, TruRating demonstrates that single-question feedback systems are not only scalable but also capable of driving measurable business impact. Metric fixation offers speed and simplicity but sacrifices depth and accuracy. It is like steering a car by watching the speedometer while ignoring the road. To fix the problem, we need to add a missing ingredient that brings customer voice back into the equation. Closing the loop requires moving beyond simple surveys to act on customer insights and communicate outcomes. The missing ingredient is an active feedback loop with three steps. Those are ask, act and announce. Most companies handle the first step, ask, by using surveys or pop-up forms. Only a few move to the second step, act, where teams review feedback, identify root causes and fix problems. Even fewer complete the third step, announce, by telling customers what changed because of their input. Why does this loop matter? It turns data into dialogue. When customers see that their voice sparks action, they feel valued and stay engaged. Zendesk found that a follow up within 48 hours doubles future survey responses and cuts churn by 30%. Active loops close the “why” gap left by behavioral metrics. Imagine a streaming service noticing a spike in mid-season drop-off. Usage data flags the episode where viewers quit; feedback explains the exit: too many product placements broke immersion. Start with a single, context-specific question placed at a high-impact moment. Route responses to a cross-functional team that can act quickly on experience, messaging and policy. Next, send a concise thank you, share what you learned and outline the first change you will make. Six weeks later, update participants on progress. A common mistake is to release new features and celebrate them without listening to customer feedback. Maybe you should consider addressing the issues your customers are facing before releasing new features and benefits. I use one tool to build emails and one tool only, Stripo. It is the most flexible editor I have ever used. But what really sets it apart is how they handle feedback. When you request a new feature or report a bug, they respond, tell you when they will fix it and actually follow through. I have seen real changes happen based on my input. It does not make me feel special. It makes me feel heard, not to mention the fact it makes my life easier. Other companies tell me they will put my suggestion on their “product roadmap” that they “take very seriously.” Roadmap or no, it feels like I’m just being pushed aside. Technology streamlines every step. Modern voice of the customer platforms tag themes, flag urgent issues and trigger tickets. AI sentiment analysis highlights emotional drivers that correlate with churn. Tech also tracks how many suggestions led to real change, which reinforces accountability. Do not over-promise. Focus on a few high-impact fixes per cycle. Do not ask questions you will not address. Finally, do not collect feedback just to check a box. If customers take the time to respond, they should see something change as a result. Active feedback loops do more than patch problems; they create a culture of listening. A few market shifts make active feedback loops essential. Privacy rules reduce passive tracking. As cookies fade, direct questions respect consent. Meanwhile, the demand for personalization has been rising. According to Accenture, 91% of people say they are more likely to shop with brands that recognize them and offer helpful suggestions, and 83% are willing to share their data if it helps make that happen. Another big market shift is that AI requires qualitative fuel. Large language models mine comment text for insight unavailable in clicks alone. Finally, don’t forget that social media amplifies voices. Forty-eight percent of online consumers have left a negative review online. Private loops solve issues before they go public. Forward-looking brands already benefit. SMS surveys achieve up to 45% response rates for Shopify customer feedback collection, with a read rate of 98%. When Delta implemented new customer survey software from Medallia, the company saw response rates double compared to their existing questionnaires during the initial testing period. Failing to adapt means flying blind as privacy rules tighten and dashboards lose fidelity. Active loops keep you aligned with consent-based data and evolving customer demands. Related Article: The State of Consumer Data Privacy Legislation in 2025 Common objections include the belief that annual surveys are enough because issues evolve quickly, but week-to-week changes demand timely feedback. Some worry customers will not respond, yet short questions at the right moment and visible follow-up drive higher response rates. Others cite a lack of analysis resources, yet freemium AI tools can tag themes in minutes. Scale is no longer a barrier. Amazon processes approximately 10 million customer opinions monthly through seller feedback alone, which demonstrates how large-scale operations can still maintain responsive customer engagement. Across industries, companies that close the feedback loop achieve significant measurable improvements. Research shows an average six-point net promoter score increase when organizations actively respond to customer feedback. Companies that close the loop with customers reduce their churn by a minimum of 2.3% annually, while those that don't close the loop increase their churn by at least 2.1% every year. Also, when it comes to revenue impact, upselling strategies informed by customer feedback can lead to revenue increases of 10-30% on average. Businesses see up to a 20% increase in customer lifetime value when implementing effective feedback-driven upselling approaches. Firms that cite loop programs on earnings calls often enjoy higher valuations. In 2009, Domino's Pizza was facing a severe brand crisis. The company was plagued by widespread customer dissatisfaction, with complaints describing their pizza as having "sauce that tasted like ketchup" and "crust that tasted like cardboard." Customer feedback was overwhelmingly negative, with frequent complaints about taste and quality. The company ranked last in a 2009 consumer taste preference survey, tied with Chuck E. Cheese. Sales were stagnant, customer satisfaction was at an all-time low, and the brand had developed a reputation for subpar food quality. Social media complaints and negative word-of-mouth were actively driving customers away. The company's stock price had fallen to $6.87 by Dec. 31, 2009, and same-store sales declined for the first time in company history in 2008, continuing into 2009. Domino’s Pizza collected customer criticism across surveys, reviews, social media and employee input. They publicized harsh feedback verbatim in national commercials to demonstrate accountability. They then launched the “Pizza Turnaround” campaign with the CEO openly acknowledging past failures. Next, they reformulated core recipes, including new sauce, a new cheese blend and garlic-seasoned crust. They retrained staff through comprehensive training programs to improve quality and consistency, and they upgraded delivery systems and kitchen equipment to support operational improvements. Streamlining processes allowed them to address service issues and improve overall efficiency. Significantly, they created a transparent communication system outlining changes, timelines and quality goals, and they released behind-the-scenes footage documenting the recipe and quality transformation. Through their “Oh Yes We Did” campaign, they reinforced their turnaround and ongoing commitment. Stock price rose from $6.87 in 2009 to $426.77 by 2024, a 6,200%+ increase, and U.S. market share grew from 9% to 15%. Q1 2010 same-store sales jumped 14.3%, the highest in company history at that time, and full-year 2010 same-store sales grew 9.9%. In 2010, Domino’s achieved its first positive domestic store growth since 2007, and they rebranded from “last resort” to the world’s second-largest pizza chain. They shifted their identity to a technology-driven company, with digital roles comprising half of HQ staff, and they rebuilt customer loyalty and established a stronger foundation for sustainable growth. The Domino's case demonstrates that radical transparency, comprehensive operational changes and authentic customer engagement can drive remarkable business turnarounds even when starting from a severely damaged brand position. First, set a clear objective; choose one journey stage to improve. Next, map the moment; position the prompt seconds after that stage ends. Then craft a microsurvey using plain language, with one rating question and an optional comment. Fourth, choose a channel; match customer preference, whether that’s SMS, in-app, email or kiosk. Fifth, build a response team and give them the authority to act. Next, close the loop publicly; you can thank them 48 hours later and update customers once changes go live. Finally, measure and iterate. Track response, resolution time and business outcome. You can expand your strategy once targets are hit. Some optional enhancements to this roadmap include incentivizing first-time responses with points or donations, localizing questions to key languages and rotating open-text prompts each quarter. However, remember not to survey your customers about things you can’t deliver on. Start on freemium tools; upgrade to sentiment analysis and CRM integration as volume grows. Create a feedback council to standardize libraries and share wins. Momentum beats perfection. Within a year, you can evolve from reactive support to proactive experience design that only includes one question, one action and one announcement at a time. Customer insight is not a data problem. It’s a trust problem. Customers are not reluctant to share; they are reluctant to repeat themselves. They will offer feedback but only when it feels like a conversation. They want to know that their answers will lead to action. The data supports this. Short, well-timed questions earn strong response rates, and companies that close the loop turn those responses into higher retention, greater revenue and a more resilient customer base. This is what happens when organizations stop guessing and start asking. Direct feedback delivers results when it is treated as input for action, not just another metric to monitor. One honest answer from a customer at the right moment can reveal more than weeks of behavioral data. You do not need to build a complex feedback architecture to begin. Ask one meaningful question. Fix one visible issue. Communicate one tangible change. Then ask again. That is how trust is built and rebuilt. If your company cannot act on customer input today, it is not ready for customer retention strategies, personalization or AI automation. But if you can respond to one piece of feedback right now, you are further ahead than most. Listening is not a campaign; it is a commitment. Active feedback is the foundation of sustainable growth.

Title: WOLF Stock To $20?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Wolfspeed, Inc. logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, United ... More States, on January 3, 2025. (Photo Illustration by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) While Wolfspeed faces severe financial challenges, recent developments suggest a potential turnaround story that could deliver exceptional returns for risk-tolerant investors willing to bet on the company’s survival and recovery. The appointment of Gregor van Issum as CFO sparked immediate investor confidence, driving the stock price up 2x following the announcement. Van Issum brings substantial semiconductor industry experience from his previous roles at ams-OSRAM and NXP, two respected players in the sector. His track record suggests he understands the complexities of semiconductor operations and financial management. Now, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process has already delivered significant improvements to Wolfspeed’s financial structure. The company expects to eliminate nearly $4.6 billion in debt (70% reduction) and cut annual interest payments by 60%, dramatically improving its cost structure and cash flow dynamics. Wolfspeed operates in the silicon carbide semiconductor space, which offers superior energy efficiency compared to traditional silicon chips. This technology is increasingly critical for electric vehicle applications, positioning the company in a high-growth market segment. However, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than a single stock, you might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, garnering >91% returns since its inception. Additionally, check out – MSFT Stock To $1,000? If Wolfspeed successfully navigates its financial restructuring and executes its turnaround plan, the upside potential is substantial: The Wolfspeed turnaround story represents a classic high-risk, high-reward investment scenario. While the potential upside is substantial if the company successfully executes its restructuring and capitalizes on the growing silicon carbide market, the probability of success remains uncertain given the company’s operational challenges and competitive pressures. Investors considering this opportunity should view it as a speculative position suitable only for those who can absorb complete loss while recognizing that successful turnarounds in distressed technology companies can generate exceptional returns for those willing to accept the substantial risks involved. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

HuffPost may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Shopping Writer for HuffPost With tariffs still threatening to make products more expensive, 2025’s Prime Day deals couldn’t have come at a better time. It’s worth jumping on big sales when they appear so you aren’t stuck paying significantly higher prices on items like personal electronics, tools and foreign goods with the fluctuating economy. According to previous HuffPost coverage, price hikes can affect multiple categories, including tech, major kitchen appliances, Korean skin care and more. Products in all of these categories are on sale for Prime Day July 8 through 11, so we rounded up some of the best deals to help you save on these investments and prevent yourself from having to pay even higher prices for the items you want. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. HuffPost readers love a high-quality skin care product that can replace pricey facial treatments, like this K-beauty serum that one beauty TikToker calls “filler in a bottle.” Its prowess is attributed to an ingredient called PDRN, which is widely used in injectables overseas. It has anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing capabilities that can improve skin firmness and leave recipients with a telltale glow. It's usually extracted from salmon sperm cells, but Iope's serum has a completely vegan, plant-based formula that is as unique as it is effective. Additional ingredients like niacinamide, probiotics and caffeine round out this repairing formulation — all ingredients that are beloved by HuffPost editors and readers alike. It's such a great product that it was awarded a HuffPicks seal of approval. This 10-liter air fryer has 17 preset settings and three racks, with a maximum temperature of 400 degrees. You can bake, air fry, dehydrate or even used the included rotisserie spit to cook a rotisserie chicken. There's also a drip tray to catch messes on the bottom and make cleanup easier. You can clean the air in rooms up to 1,076 feet with this large room air purifier, which has dual air intakes to purify twice as fast (it only needs 60 minutes for a room that size). It operates nearly silent at just 24 dB, and you can choose between four fan speeds or just set it to automatic mode and let it choose for you based on the air quality. There's also a timer with three settings, so you can set it and forget it. The air purifier comes in black or white. Made by the K-beauty company Medicube, this collagen face mask is made to be worn over and can boost your skin's elasticity while you sleep. In addition to collagen, the mask contains skin-nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycerin and ceramide NP for hydration, skin barrier maintenance, addressing fine lines and other benefits. The mask dries down in 15 minutes and is designed to peel off easily in one piece for little mess. According to previous HuffPost coverage, home improvement items like tools may be affected by tariffs, so why not stock up on them at a discount while you can? This kit from trusted brand Dewalt contains a cordless oscillating multi-tool, 20V Max battery, blades for cutting wood, a sanding pad with sandpaper and other handy tools. It all comes with a handy tool bag and a storage box. Reviewers say the oscillating tool works on rubber, metal, plastic and wood. More advanced than your average speaker, this amplifier can upgrade your home entertainment system with 60 watts per channel by connecting to your TV, record player and other speakers. The amp is compatible with Alexa and Google Home, and you can stream Spotify, Amazon Music and more directly from it. You can use the WiiM app to adjust the volume and other settings from anywhere. A must-have home improvement tool, this cordless drill by Black + Decker uses a 20V Max battery to operate and comes with a charger. The drill features LED lights for visibility, an 11-position clutch and a variable speed trigger for easy control. There's also a built-in bit holder for easy storage. Having an extra screen can help you see everything at once when you're working on a computer or smaller device. This Arzopa monitor has a 1080P, 15.6-inch display that can connect to your other devices with a USB-C cable. The monitor has a dual speaker system to deliver powerful audio, and can connect to a Mac, PC, Xbox, Switch, iPhone and more. Great for a small space like an apartment, dorm or even RV, this portable dishwasher can go right on the countertop and can hold up to two full place settings, or 30+ items. It only consumes 6 liters of water per cycle using the built-in tank, and has five washing programs in addition to an auto-open function and a UV sterilization function. You can even use this to wash fruit. You might be familiar with Cosrx's snail mucin essence, which we've covered here at HuffPost many times. But the essence isn't the only snail mucin product out there — Cosrx also makes this snail mucin moisturizer, which we found to be at a steeper discount. The cream has 92% snail mucin for moisturizing and exfoliating, along with hyaluronic acid. The cream is lightweight and can address redness, dryness and even acne scars. Get two gadgets in one with this dual air purifier and fan from Dyson. The fan circulates air and keeps you cool while the purifier works to trap pollutants in the HEPA filter. You can use Dyson's app to track changes in air quality and pre-set the machine for intervals between 30 minutes and 8 hours. The fan also features a night mode that operates more quietly so it won't disturb your sleep. The Google Nest Thermostat allows you to track your energy consumption, offers recommendations for when it's best to use in-house heating or cooling systems, as well as offers complete control of a home's temperature even when users aren't at home. The thermostat is designed to work without a C wire in most homes and doesn't require professional help to install nor the need for any other Google smart home devices. A lesser known — but perhaps just as good as — alternative to the uber-expensive Dyson Airwrap is the Shark FlexStyle multi-styler, a tool that utilizes the same reverse directional airflow technology and functionality as the famed predecessor, but with some added ergonomic differences. The FlexStyle features a swivel function, which changes the 90-degree positioning of the arm into more of a traditional-shaped hair dryer to help make it less cumbersome for all-over styling and easier for creating multi-directional curls. This tool comes with up to five attachments to meet your styling needs whether you're creating bouncy curls, salon-style blowouts or smoothing frizz. Promising review: "I have been using this beautiful instrument for the past few months and I have to say it is definitely a major time saver in the morning.It’s pretty easy to find your groove with the tool after the first few uses. I will say the handle is long with the curling attachment so I just adjust my grip towards the center of the handle and it actually feels way more balanced. Definitely a tool I enjoy to use for my hair and would recommend!" — Ben This well-known stick vacuum from Dyson makes vacuuming easier than ever thanks to its lightweight body and extra-portable cordless design, with two powerful cleaning modes so you can tailor its suction to the job at hand while enjoying up to 40 minutes of cord-free runtime. Those with pets (or long hair) will also appreciate how effectively this thing traps fur and hair without getting strands tangled in its brush. Plus, it's designed to capture an impressive 99.99% of dust and other allergens in its filter for a cleaner home and cleaner air. Bose infused its signature high-fidelity sound and powerful noise-canceling technology into these over-the-ear wireless headphones that offer 20 hours of listening per charge. Enjoy 11 levels of active noise canceling and a microphone system that allows you to take calls and be heard, even in noisy environments. K-beauty brand Anua makes this pore control cleansing oil with heartleaf, a Southeast Asian plant that has anti-inflammatory properties. You can use it to remove makeup or SPF, or as part of a double-cleansing routine to prevent your pores from clogging. According to the brand, you may begin to see a decrease in your skin's production of sebum (the oily substance your skin produces that can clog and cause breakouts) in as little as four weeks. Instantly get coffee shop-quality espresso in the comfort of your home with this wildly popular full-service espresso machine. Lattes, Americanos, cappuccinos and espresso shots are pulled to precision alongside a built-in conical burr grinder that grinds beans on demand and a frother wand for making perfectly delicious steamed milk.It’s the stuff coffee dreams are made of. HuffPost Shopping managing editor Emily Ruane raves about this Breville machine. “I did as much research as I could and this model seemed to be a popular and well-reviewed option,” she said. “The Breville was pricy, but it gets used at least twice a day. I wake up every morning looking forward to a perfect latte and I truly feel so fortunate to be able to enjoy this convenience at home.” Anker's Soundcore Bluetooth speaker is an outdoor-ready and super portable device that delivers crystal-clear sound with enhanced bass and zero distortion thanks to an advanced digital signal processor. This 12W speaker is also completely waterproof so you can enjoy up to 24 hours of listening time per charge no matter where you are. It's possible you've seen some version of these overnight hydrogel masks on TikTok that start off opaque and become transparent as all of the infused goodness absorbs into skin, leaving behind a complexion that's plump, hydrated and glass-like. These Biodance masks contain a collagen-peptide that's of a low molecular weight to penetrate deeper into the skin. It also has brightening niacinamide, moisture-trapping hyaluronic acid and galactomyces to improve skin tone and texture. These high-quality headphones are currently retailing for just $35. Enjoy up to 32 hours of battery life and if you ever forget to charge them, you can speed-charge for two hours of listening time in just 10 minutes. Make calls on the go with a “VoiceAware” program that lets you limit how much of your own voice you hear as you talk. These earbuds are water and dust-resistant, perfect for taking on the trail, mowing the lawn or using while working out or working at your desk. When it comes to quickly brewed single-serve coffee, no one does it like Keurig, and their K-Elite model has quickly become a fan-favorite. Choose between multiple brew types and strengths, including an iced coffee setting. Given what we know about Bose and the brand's reputation for unbeatable sound, the deal on this TV soundbar is worth a mention. Connectible with Bluetooth or an HDMI cable, the speaker offers a wide natural sound and spatial audio for an immersive listening experience. Stop misplacing your keys by attaching them to a Bluetooth tracker. Tile by Life360 Mate uses an app to help you locate whatever item you attach it to. The tracker can also be triggered as an SOS alert in case of emergencies. The Instant Pot Pro manages to do the work of 10 cooking appliances all in this 6-quart-capacity multi-cooker, already outfitted with five customizable settings so you can make your own recipes at the touch of a button. Home cooks can do everything from sauté to steam to sous vide and even make yogurt. The SoundLink Flex by Bose claims to offer the clearest possible sound by using a special positioning technology that allows the water-resistant speaker to sense what position it's in for optimal clarity. Its state-of-the-art design features deep, clear, and immersive audio and up to 12 hours of listening per charge.

The Verge’s favorite deals from Amazon’s four-day sales event, from earbuds and video games to robot vacuums and more. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Day one of Prime Day is in the books. The good news? Almost all of the great deals survived the night, and we’re monitoring them all right here in our Prime Day day two post. As such, the post below will no longer be updated. Original article follows below. Prime Day, Amazon’s four-day thunderdome of exclusive deals, is here. Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we anticipate this to be the best moment of the year to score discounts on headphones, laptops, TVs, gaming gear, and really anything else that might be on your wishlist — or someone else’s. We sorted through thousands of deals, ultimately narrowing them down to include products we’ve tried (many of which we’ve reviewed) and can vouch for. To repeat, there will be four — count ’em — four days of deals aimed at Prime subscribers, which means you have double the amount of time to save this year. We don’t expect each new day to wipe the slate clean of previous deals and introduce brand-new ones; however, there will likely be some time-sensitive lighting discounts added at intervals throughout, sprinkled on like a garnish. Also, some big retailers outside of Amazon, including Walmart and Best Buy, are also slashing prices, so we’ve added more purchasing options whenever possible. The Sonos Ace are the company’s first set of wireless headphones. They feature a premium, comfortable build and active noise cancellation, along with compatibility with Sonos Arc and other Sonos soundbars. Read our review.

The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning. Read our review. The latest pair of Beats earbuds are a no-brainer for athletes. They pack fantastic sound and thumping bass, along with active noise cancellation, IPX4 water resistance, and heart rate monitoring. Read our review. Bose’s QuietComfort Headphones, which replace the QuietComfort 45, have adjustable noise cancellation and the ability to set custom modes. However, they lack immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones.

Our reviewer Victoria Song praised their cozy fit as well as their USB-C charging (goodbye, proprietary charger!). Read our review.

Anker’s jack-of-all-trades travel adapter packs enough ports to refill your devices during some downtime. It features one AC outlet, two USB-C ports (one tops out at 20W), and two USB-A ports. It’s not the fastest wall charger, but it’s a solid choice when you can find it at a discount. Twelve South’s 3-in-1 charging stand offers full 15W MagSafe iPhone charging and can simultaneously top up a set of AirPods while fast-charging a compatible Apple Watch. The charger includes a power supply (with travel adapters) to deliver enough juice over its five-foot / 1.5m USB cable. A compact, flexible Qi2 charger for vent and dash mounting. Read our review.

Read our review. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a 6.3-inch outer screen and an eight-inch inner screen once it’s unfolded — both of which are larger than the original Pixel Fold. The new foldable also lies flat when opened, sports IPX8 weather resistance, and offers a thinner design than the last-gen model. Read our review. The OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price. Read our review.

Read our review. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is still one of the best phones you can buy, even if its “Ultra”-ness is a little diminished. Two telephotos, a built-in stylus, and a big screen are the main attractions. Read our review. The Galaxy A35 5G comes with a good 6.6-inch OLED panel, a robust IP67 dust and water resistance rating, and a strong software update policy for its class. The standard Moto Razr features a 6.9-inch inner screen, accompanied by a larger 3.6-inch cover screen. Wired charging tops out at 30W, compared to the Razr Plus’ 45W, although it features 15W wireless charging, up from 5W on the previous model. Read our review. The MacBook Air is Apple’s budget-friendly laptop from 2020. It comes outfitted with the company’s M1 chip, which offers terrific performance, even if it’s not as fast as Apple’s newer models. It also sports all-day battery life, Touch ID, and MagSafe charging. Read our review. The latest version of Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer features an M4 chip and support for Apple Intelligence.

The Boox Palma 2 is a 6.3-inch smartphone-sized e-reader that’s highly portable. It also runs on Android and comes with the Google Play Store built-in, allowing you to download apps for other digital bookstores, newspapers, note-taking apps, and more. Read our review. The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first e-reader with a color display. It also boasts 32GB of storage, waterproofing, and support for wireless charging. Read our review. Google’s 11-inch Pixel Tablet uses the same Tensor G2 chip found in the Pixel 7 lineup. It also features a crisp LCD display and a four-speaker sound array. Read our review. Amazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance. It also boasts longer battery life than the previous model, retains IPX8 waterproofing, and includes a USB-C port. Read our review. Google’s excellent TV Streamer 4K is its best attempt at a streaming device yet, offering built-in ethernet along with smart home compatibility with Matter and Thread. Read our review. Amazon’s latest streaming stick is faster than its predecessor with Wi-Fi 6E and double the storage. It also now displays widgets and artwork when idle while continuing to offer Alexa integration. LG’s B4 might be one of the cheapest OLED TVs available, but it still offers plenty of bang for your buck — including four HDMI 2.1 ports, speedy performance, and five years’ worth of webOS updates. TCL’s Mini LED QLED TV is a great value, particularly for those who want a fast frame rate and a bright picture. It offers a 144Hz refresh rate, features two HDMI 2.1 ports, and supports Google TV’s robust software. Samsung’s art-inspired 4K TV uses an anti-glare matte QLED display, which can showcase artwork and photos with canvas-like quality when idle. Bargain hunters seeking a large, yet reasonably priced, 65-inch OLED TV should consider Samsung’s S85D. It’s Samsung’s entry-level model, though you still get HDMI 2.1 ports, 4K resolution at 120Hz with consoles, and a variable refresh rate. iFFALCON’s slim-bezeled mural TV takes after Samsung’s Frame TV, but costs significantly less. The TCL sub-brand’s TV sports an art mode and several high-end features, including a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. Alienware is a major player when it comes to OLED monitors. This 27-inch 360Hz model hits the sweet spot in terms of screen resolution, features, and — most importantly — price. This ultrawide (21:9) QHD OLED gaming monitor has a 165Hz refresh rate, a fast response time, and a slick design. It’s tough to get more OLED for your money than with this model when it’s discounted. The newer Echo Spot is an excellent smart alarm clock with decent sound for its size and no camera. It features Amazon’s smart voice assistant for voice control and is worthy of a spot on your nightstand. Read our review. If you’ve ever wished you had a robot that could push a button for you, that’s precisely what the SwitchBot Bot does. It’s simple, smart, and works on anything with a button. Stick it on the device you want to turn on or off, and you’re set. The newest Echo Show 5 is just as small as its predecessor but features updated mics and a speaker system that delivers double the bass and clearer sound quality. Meross makes a handy add-on that can transform a variety of garage door models into smart doors that you can open remotely. It works with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. Developed in partnership with Resideo, the Amazon Smart Thermostat allows you to control the temperature of your home through Alexa voice controls and remotely via an app. Read our review. The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro delivers high-quality video with adjustable, accurate radar-powered motion detection, 2,000 lumens of light, and a good digital zoom. It offers smart alerts for people or motion and works with Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and Ring’s excellent app. This is a great battery-powered buzzer with excellent video quality, a good head-to-toe view, and very speedy response times for a battery doorbell. It integrates well with Amazon Alexa and can record locally to a Ring Alarm Pro, but the battery only lasts about two months unless you turn on battery-saving features. The fifth-gen Echo Dot touts a temperature sensor, better sound, and faster response time than the prior model. It can also act as an extender for your Eero Wi-Fi system. Read our review. Amazon’s apt-titled Smart Plug doesn’t require a hub and lets you add Alexa functionality to any outlet, allowing you to control a range of devices with just your voice. These smart lights have beautiful colors, a nice selection of festive scenes, and an easy-to-use app. They are super reliable when paired with a Hue Bridge and also work over Bluetooth. They come in two lengths, work with all the major smart home platforms, and are Matter-compatible. With top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop which is why it’s our top pick overall. It features Roborock’s best obstacle avoidance, innovative features like dirt detection, and a hands-free dock that makes it an expensive but excellent choice. With a neat ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can’t reach. The X10 is a great robovac with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, a user-friendly app, and good mapping capabilities. Our favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation. It also features an auto-empty dock. The Sonos Beam (second-gen) is a compact soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos and can stream music from a plethora of services. Read our review. Vizio’s Elevate SE is a budget-friendly alternative to its high-end Elevate soundbar. It still features many of the same highlights, though, including booming sound quality and rotating speakers that provide the verticality required for Dolby Atmos content. Ultimate Ears’ latest disc-shaped Bluetooth speaker is small and affordable, with a built-in strap for attaching it to your belongings. It also charges via USB-C and features an IP67 rating against dust and water, along with up to 12 hours of battery life. The last-gen JBL Go 3 may not be quite as powerful as larger models in JBL’s current lineup, but it remains a great pool-ready Bluetooth speaker that can fit in your pocket. If you’ve ever wanted a Bluetooth speaker that looks like a guitar amp, Marshall’s Acton III is one of the best. It’s got tactile switches and knobs out the wazoo, letting you fine-tune the bass and treble, along with the option to plug in a 3.5mm source or use Bluetooth for playback. The WiiM Mini makes it easy to wirelessly stream music from your phone, a streaming service, or other local storage to existing speakers you already have. It supports AirPlay 2 and a variety of streaming services. Sonos’ Era 100 smart speaker is a replacement for the older Sonos One, utilizing two tweeters (left and right) and one larger woofer. In addition to Wi-Fi, the Era 100 also supports Bluetooth audio and line-in playback via an optional 3.5mm to USB-C adapter. Read our review. The JBL Authentics 300 is one of only a few smart speakers on the market with simultaneous Google Assistant and Alexa support. The ’70s-style speaker is heavy, but it produces impressive, powerful sound, especially at louder volumes. Read our review. Star Wars Outlaws is an original open-world adventure set in the vast universe of the iconic film series. It stars Kay Vess, a protagonist looking to steal from criminal overlords to gain her freedom. A new expansion featuring Lando Calrissian recently launched, alongside an update that improves stealth and some of the game’s most glaring issues. Read our review. Princess Zelda’s first solo adventure as a playable character tasks her with saving her people, including Link, who have been taken away through mysterious rifts. Read our review.

Read our review. If you bought a Meta Quest 2, you’re a prime candidate for the Quest 3S. It’s a faster, more comfortable VR headset that runs the same chipset as the pricier Quest 3. While its screen resolution hasn’t improved, nearly everything else about the hardware has. Read our review. What if the dream of Microsoft’s Kinect lived on? It does in the Nex Playground, an all-in-one, motion-controlled console filled with kid-friendly games. Exhaust and entertain your little ones. You’re welcome. This affordable kit includes two glossy screen protectors for the Nintendo Switch 2 that are very easy to install on the system. The G Pro X Superlight 2 is Logitech’s lightest and most advanced mouse to date. It features a 32,000 DPI Hero 2 sensor and 4kHz polling rate, as well as support for USB-C charging and Logitech’s Powerplay mouse mat. For something cheaper — and in some ways better — than Nintendo’s official Pro controller, there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2, which works with the original Switch and Switch 2. It features TMR joysticks with trigger switches for adjusting the feel, as well as vibration and motion control support. Sony’s wireless gaming buds offer low latency, active noise cancellation, and support for both Bluetooth and USB-C. The Insta360 Link 2 offers the same auto-swiveling design as its predecessor, but it’s smaller and offers a slate of new features, including group tracking and no-follow zones. The MK.2 version of the standard Stream Deck comes with 15 programmable buttons, a swappable faceplate, and a detachable stand. A teleprompter is a luxury. They help you make it look effortless to look at your camera as you read from a script or a chat log. Elgato’s option includes a small screen and a mirror, the latter of which allows you to see what you need to look at without breaking eye contact with viewers. Samsung’s ultrafast 990 Pro is a PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe SSD that can reach sequential read speeds of 7,450MB/s and write speeds of 6,900MB/s. It’s more than capable for high-end PC builds, and its preinstalled heatsink means it’s easily installable into a PlayStation 5. Its heatsink even has a bit of RGB lighting for some extra pop (if you’re able to see it). The Keychron V1 is one of the best entry-level wired mechanical keyboards available. It has hot-swappable switches, full remappability with VIA, great build quality, RGB backlighting, and double-shot PBT keycaps for under $100. A strategy card game in which players compete to build Renaissance Europe’s most lucrative and prestigious jewelry business. Azul is a game in which you arrange patterned tiles in order to create the most beautiful tapestry possible. Arranging tiles in a strategic sequence will help you build your score while limiting your opponents’ ability to grow theirs. The latest Dungeons & Dragons Player’s Handbook teaches you about 12 core classes, 48 subclasses, and helps you construct your story with 16 backgrounds and 75 feats. With a bit of help, you’ll be DMing your own original campaigns in no time. Apple’s AirTags are unobtrusive, waterproof, and tap into the massive Find My network for out-of-range locating. Read our original review. Furbo’s rotating 1080p gadget can fling treats on command and automatically track your pet as they roam around your home, allowing you to keep a closer eye on your pet via a mobile app when you’re away. Slice’s retractable, finger-friendly ceramic blade is great for tearing through packing tape and cutting plastic wrapping. The comfy tool also features a sturdy, reinforced nylon handle and a hooked design that makes it easy to stow when not in use. LifeStraw’s basic filter removes unwanted viruses, bacteria, and microplastics as you drink, giving you a safe way to hydrate no matter where you are. Lego’s brick-ified replica of an Imperial Star Destroyer is an excellent 1,555-piece throwback to Star Wars: A New Hope, one that comes with seven minifigs, plenty of interior detail, and a convenient handle for carrying it around the room. The ChomChom is a reusable roller that works great for removing unwanted pet hair from furniture, allowing you to skip lint rollers, vacuuming, and other cleaning tools in a pinch. Bird Buddy’s charming, camera-equipped feeder identifies and snaps shots of each bird that stops by, supplementing its 5-megapixel stills with insightful facts via an app. The pocketable HoverAir X1 keeps things simple, with a 2.7K at 30fps max resolution and six preset flight modes for easy, hands-free shooting. It lacks GPS and obstacle avoidance, but it launches in seconds and is easy to use. Look, a carpet cleaner is not a very Verge-y gadget. But we’ve all got carpets and / or upholstery to keep clean, right? Luckily, Bissell’s relatively compact cleaner does a great job of restoring fabrics to their original sheen with just a little elbow grease. This battery has the juice, so to speak, and quite a lot of it. Its main role is to be available to jumpstart a car battery (12V/1000A), but it has USB ports, too, making it handy for charging other devices you bring in the car. The Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth transmitter and receiver features an integrated 3.5mm cord and long-lasting battery life. It can also connect up to two sets of headphones, making it a great choice for listening to in-flight entertainment. The Xreal One aren’t the most affordable augmented-reality glasses available, but they are some of the best for displaying movies and games on the go. You can connect them via USB-C to your smartphone, tablet, or handheld gaming PC. The latest Tile Mate helps you keep track of your personal belongings from up to 350 feet away, which is 100 feet wider than its predecessor’s range. It’s also platform-agnostic, and can send SOS alerts if you pay for the $14.99 monthly Life360 Gold subscription. The Grownsy snot sucker comes with three interchangeable soft tips for a good fit and provides three levels of suction. Your kid might still hate it, but at least one of you will have an easier time with it. The Aura Carver is a lovely, 10.1-inch display that allows you to showcase photos uploaded via the web or a mobile app for Android and iOS. It’s easy to set up, crisp, and keeps unwanted pillarboxing to a minimum. Glocuscent’s rechargeable book light hangs around your neck to illuminate whatever you’re reading, while offering adjustable brightness and warmth settings. Whether you primarily drive a car, motorcycle, or a bicycle, the one thing in common with all three modes of transport is the need for well-inflated tired. This rechargeable 150psi inflator might just save you from a flat (or from being dangerously close to one) when you least expect it. Coway’s surprisingly efficient Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty is compact enough to fit in any corner of your home and offers a three-stage filtration system, including a true HEPA filter. The AeroPress has made a name among enthusiasts for its great brewing ability and extreme portability. Its simple, hands-on operation can make your morning coffee ritual more fun and engaging than a traditional drip-style maker. Hoto’s electric screwdriver is perfect for making small- to medium-sized repairs around the house. In addition to a USB-C port, the screwdriver comes with a magnetic case and 25 steel bits.

Title: Jio BlackRock to disrupt India's funds sector with low-cost strategy: sources

The joint venture between Jio Financial Services, backed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and BlackRock, enters India's 72.2 trillion rupee ($844 billion) funds market with a business structure that threatens to shake up the sector, as it leverages its large digital network to bypass traditional distributors used by the rest of the industry. Jio BlackRock plans to leverage Jio, India's largest telecom network, and BlackRock's investment management platform Aladdin, to offer differentiated products in the crowded market, two of the three sources said. The asset manager has applied to the market regulator to launch eight funds, the two sources said, adding to the first three funds it launched last month. The funds will allow for investments as low as 500 rupees ($5.83), the two sources said. The asset manager said on Monday that it has raised more than $2.1 billion across three debt mutual fund schemes and that 90 institutional investors and 67,000 retail investors have invested in these funds so far. On average, the cost associated across plans will be lower for Jio BlackRock funds compared with the industry average, one of the sources said, declining to specify a level. "By being direct only, Jio BlackRock plans to do away with the cost of distribution," this person added. Jio BlackRock declined to comment on Reuters' inquiries regarding its fund launches and pricing strategy, which have not been previously reported. At present, active funds offered through distribution on an average have a total expense ratio of about 1.78%. They can charge a maximum 2.5% of the investment amount. Direct funds generally reduce costs by 0.5% to 0.6%. Jio BlackRock intends to bypass the dominant channel of distributors, offering funds directly to institutional and retail investors, the sources said. That will reduce fee or expense ratios associated with the funds, they said. Ambani's Jio has been known to disrupt markets with its pricing and reach. Jio, India's largest telecom carrier by subscriber count, launched in 2016, became the largest by offering mobile phones and voice and data packages at well below prices prevailing in the industry. Jio BlackRock will use the distribution reach of its partner and target the existing 8 million active users of financial services on its digital platforms such as MyJio and Jio Finance, a second source familiar with the matter said. BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager at $11.6 trillion as of December 2024, is known for its passive funds, which track established indexes. It manages $7.8 trillion through exchange traded and index funds. However, Jio BlackRock plans to offer a mix of active and passive funds in India, where active funds still dominate. "Passive funds are growing in India every year and there is a potential for BlackRock to further build this segment," said the first source. Passive funds accounted for 12.11 trillion rupees, or 16.78% of total assets in India as of May, marking a 25% growth from a year earlier. The fund house plans to leverage Aladdin, an investment and risk management system, to deliver consistent returns, said the first source. Aladdin is an end-to-end investment management system that collates all analytics in one place to enable portfolio managers to take investment calls. "Relevant portions of Aladdin will be made available to Jio BlackRock's investors as well," the first source said. ($1 = 85.3730 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Jayshree P.

(Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Is it possible for Applied Materials stock (NASDAQ:AMAT) to reach close to $380 in the coming years? There is a strong likelihood, as the company is poised to benefit from the rising capital expenditures driven by the generative artificial intelligence boom. While AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) captures headlines with its stock having increased over 3x in the past two years and its valuation nearing $4 trillion, lesser-known players like Applied are essential for producing the very AI chips that Nvidia markets. These stocks could present more value and significant upside potential. The data presents a compelling case. According to SEMI, capital spending on advanced chip manufacturing equipment is expected to nearly double between 2023 and 2028, with global capex expenditures anticipated to exceed $100 billion in 2025 alone. Applied, which specializes in advanced equipment and software utilized to manufacture semiconductor chips—ranging from etchers and deposition systems to process control software—may be well situated to capture a substantial portion of this investment. The company’s clientele includes industry giants such as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel, positioning it as a central player in both the logic and memory sectors of the chip market. Applied Materials has seen its revenues increase at a robust pace, with an annual growth rate of 13% over the last five years. Although the company is expected to experience a slowdown in sales growth to about 6% for FY'25, reaching $29 billion, growth could accelerate. If Applied manages to grow its sales at an average annual rate of nearly 22% over the next three years—driven by increased demand for advanced tools for producing memory and logic chips for AI—its revenues could rise from approximately $29 billion in FY'25 to about $53 billion by FY'28, representing an increase of roughly 81%. Several trends may facilitate revenue growth in the upcoming years. The generative artificial intelligence (AI) surge is fueling a sharp increase in semiconductor demand. AI workloads necessitate substantial computational power, greater memory capacity, and more intricate chips, all of which require advanced manufacturing processes. Additionally, AI demands high-bandwidth memory and sophisticated chip packaging—areas where Applied Materials excels. For instance, producing HBM chips is three times as wafer-intensive as standard DRAM, owing to lower bit density and the necessity for 3D stacking. This directly results in higher demand for products manufactured by companies like Applied. While Applied’s considerable exposure to China, which made up over a third of its revenue in FY'24, has raised investor concerns due to U.S. export restrictions, signs of easing tensions are emerging. Recently, the U.S. and China reached a trade agreement that includes rare earth exports. As part of this accord, the Trump administration relaxed recent export license requirements for certain chip design software sold to China. If this thawing of tensions continues and extends to semiconductor equipment exports, firms like Applied could gain improved access to an essential growth market. Applied Materials has performed well in recent years, climbing from approximately $85 in early 2021 to around $190 currently. However, the increase in AMAT stock over the past four years has not been consistent, as annual returns have exhibited much greater volatility compared to the S&P 500. The stock's returns were 84% in 2021, -38% in 2022, and 68% in 2023, followed by 9% in 2024 and 17% year-to-date so far in 2025. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has proven to be significantly less volatile. Moreover, it has outperformed the S&P 500 every year in that timeframe. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with diminished risk compared to the benchmark index; offering fewer wild fluctuations as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. When we combine this substantial revenue growth with the fact that Applied's adjusted net margins (net income, or profits remaining after all expenses and taxes, represented as a percentage of revenues) are on an upward trajectory—growing from 19.6% in FY'19 to 26.5% in FY'24—we see that the company has benefitted from improved economies of scale and a more premium product mix. We anticipate that margins could continue to rise to approximately 31% by FY'28 as Applied concentrates on new technologies such as Gate-All-Around (GAA) semiconductor equipment, while also effectively managing its costs. Applied is experiencing faster growth in its services sales compared to products, which could furthermore enhance margins since services contracts typically yield recurring revenues and are increasingly focused on more lucrative software. Additionally, Applied has demonstrated considerable discipline in its capital expenditures as compared to other competitors in the chip sector, which could also contribute to higher margins. The combination of approximately 81% revenue growth with about a 20% increase in margins suggests an estimated 2.2x growth in earnings over the subsequent three years. If earnings do in fact grow by 2.2x, the P/E multiple would contract by 2.2x, assuming the stock price remains constant. However, this is precisely what investors in Applied Materials are wagering will not be the case. If earnings increase by 2.2x in the next few years, instead of the price to earnings multiple compressing from around 20x now to approximately 10x, a scenario where the P/E ratio stabilizes around 18x appears quite plausible, as the robust growth and expanding margins instill greater confidence in the future of Applied Materials.This would result in a potential doubling of Applied stock price from $190 to roughly $380 within the next few years, making it a realistic scenario.What is the time frame for this high-return possibility? While our example above illustrates a timeframe of roughly three years, in practice, whether it takes three years or four may not significantly differ; as long as Applied is on this revenue expansion path, with margins remaining stable, the stock price could respond accordingly. While there may be upside potential for AMAT stock, there are inherent risks associated with investing in individual stocks. Conversely, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has exceeded its all-cap stocks benchmark (which combines the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. What is the reason for this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach, allowing optimal capitalizing on thriving market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as elaborated in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Set in the former O’Brien’s Pub building, which was subsequently home to The Chop House, this is now a serious diningroom with a long counter for walk-ins and a smaller room at the back. The menu sticks to local and seasonal produce – seafood chowder, deep-fried calamari, pan-fried halibut with leek and mussel sauce, duck leg confit with spring onion champ and buttered carrots. There’s also an 18-seat garden terrace – uncovered, unheated, and fully weather dependent. Corinna Hardgrave When the sun is shining there is no better place to be than outdoors at Fisk with a selection of their original seafood dishes lined up in front of you and a cold drink in hand. Think gochujang glazed trout, buttery brioche roll stuffed with prawn cocktail or spicy Bloody Mary topped with oyster and shrimp. It turns out that chef Tony Davidson is also rather handy with Mexican food too, so dig in. Joanne Cronin A Green Egg barbecue runs hot here, chargrilling vegetables such as asparagus for brunch, served under a heated 80-seat yurt-style tent. Rose O’Toole (formerly of Misunderstood Heron, Aimsir) runs the kitchen, serving up Irish crab and smoked black pudding benedict, Doyle’s sausage brunch burger and house-made sourdough with romesco. The wood-fired oven slow-cooks meats for sandwiches and will fire up again for Grangecon Kitchen pizzas on summer weekends. Sunday pop-ups offer a set menu (€45-€55) built around local produce. CH It’s a bit of a drive to Helen’s Bar, but the reward is a table outside overlooking Kenmare Bay – boats bobbing below, mountains stacked behind. The menu keeps it simple: bowls of mussels, plates of crab claws, fresh fish pulled from the bay and straight on to the plate. Good value, easy-going service and seafood that repays the detour in full. CH Lobster grilled with garlic butter and chips sets the tone here, backed by wild Irish fish and chips, mussels with cream, garlic and white wine and crab claws caught aboard the Atlantic Freedom, served swimming in garlic butter. There’s also wild Irish smoked ling – “smokies” – baked with crème fraîche. A heated terrace with a permanent roof and three beach huts makes outdoor eating possible whatever the weather. CH In Clifden’s former post office, Michael and Hannah Nagle serve a seafood menu that gets straight to the point. Fish and chips (€21), half lobster and chips (€28), mussels with sourdough (€15), and crab claws (€16) are the backbone, while daily specials like mackerel with apple and cucumber (€12) keep things fresh. The live-fire konro grill adds a smoky edge, and outdoor seating with heaters and blankets makes it a great spot, rain or shine. Larger groups can book a two-set menu (€30-€65). CH Diarmuid Ó Mathúna runs one of the best daytime spots around – breakfast, brunch and lunch built on proper seasonal produce. The taco with deep-fried Ros an Mhíl haddock, Aran Islands crab salad with Velvet Cloud yoghurt, and the toastie with Feeney’s pulled bacon collar are all worth the trip. Outside, there’s now a 40-seat garden, half covered, backed by 22 solar panels. They even make their own condiments, from honey mustard mayo to berry compote. CH Casual by day with small plates and sandwiches, more focused at night, William Browne’s Blackrock spot has James Strathern (ex-Dede, Orwell Road, Roe Wines) in the kitchen. There’s a short a la carte and a six-course tasting menu at €64. Cod and nduja arancini, red mullet crudo, wild garlic gnocchi and sausage and ricotta ravioli keep it tight. A sea-view heated deck with 12 uncovered seats makes the most of the setting. DJ nights and summer events are planned. CH Keith Coleman – formerly of Roots, Fumbally and Fia – is behind some of the best casual food in Dublin. The evening menu runs Thursday to Saturday: roast Iona Farm carrots with labneh and chermoula, cauliflower with smoky cashew sauce, free-range chicken thigh with tzatziki and hot honey. The sheltered 42-seat garden, planted and properly thought through, is one of the best places in the city to sit and eat when the weather behaves. A new bakery and test kitchen are on the way later this year. CH In a restored 1820s coach house, Ciaran Kiely (ex-Oliveto) is cooking over a bespoke ember pit, working with Ballincarey Organic Farm, An Tairseach and Higgins butchers. The menu runs from Sheelagh’s beetroot with St Tola’s goat’s cheese to Kilmore Quay monkfish, pork belly, and a Wagyu cheeseburger that means business. Outside, a 40-seat terrace – half covered, marble tables, wood stove and heaters – makes outdoor eating worth a gamble. Thursday nights run a two- or three-course neighbourhood menu.

Title: Revenue veto ‘caps use of Scarp small business rescue scheme’

Expert warns the potential opt-out stops some firms using the project Dessie Morrow, of Azets Ireland. Photo: Brian Claffey An effective veto the Revenue Commissioners have over allowing debtors to use the small company administrative rescue process (Scarp) is weighing on wider adoption of the scheme, despite increasing signs of distress on firms, according to Dessie Morrow, a specialist in company rescues. The latest Scarp Index from accountancy firm Azets, where Mr Morrow is a partner, shows construction, hospitality and alcohol producing sectors accounted for the highest proportion of businesses using the scheme so far this year. It also shows a 15pc increase in the number of businesses being restructured using the Scarp, compared to the first half last year, an increase that is consistent with higher numbers of insolvencies and other forms of distress. The latest index shows a total of 100 business have now used the Scarp process since scheme launched in 2021. Mr Morrow says 1,314 jobs have saved thanks to use of the rescue process. Scarp was introduced following lengthy consultation with industry as an alternative to the more expensive and lengthy examinership regime. The idea is to provide a simplified restructuring mechanism for viable small companies facing financial distress, with only a relatively light court involvement. A Scarp process is initiated by companies themselves and can begin without any court approval being required, helping to slash overall costs. The first step is the appointment of a specialist adviser – generally an accountant specialising in insolvency who must then notify creditors the process is under way and they have 50 days to come up with a rescue plan acceptable to the various affected parties. Including a 21-day cooling-off period, the process must be concluded within 70 days. Creditors who stand to lose under a rescue deal can object. Crucially however, state agencies including Revenue and the Department of Social Protection, can opt out of a Scarp arrangement, meaning even if a deal is done with other creditors and landlords, for example, a business may be left with what is regards as unsustainable tax debts including warehoused Covid era liabilities. Mr Morrow says Revenue has in practice been willing to engage with rescue efforts, but the risk it will not row in behind a scheme is a disincentive to businesses operators from attempting to restructure. “The Revenue opt out does deter businesses,” he said. It is one of a number of issues identified by Azets following an analysis of the 100 Scarp cases. It is calling for the existing Revenue opt-out at the start of the process to be removed. It also argues the short time frame of the process can create resource constraints in particular for micro companies where an individual may be responsible for a number of areas within the business – everything from staffing the counter to bookkeeping. The proposed solution is to bring the process to a pre-populated form-filling stage as a first phase. Meanwhile, the Scarp Index for the first half of the year shows 15 processes have started to date in 2025: hospitality (20pc) accounted for the highest proportion of cases, followed by the construction (13pc) and alcohol producing (13pc) sectors, an indicator that uncertainty around trade tariffs may already be impacting the export orientated boutique spirits sector. Among the businesses to have successfully undergone Scarp with the support of Azets advisers this year are Big Mike’s Restaurant in Blackrock and New Century Engineering.

Title: $30 billion blast-off: Why Rocket Lab just hit an all-time high and the 32,000 Kiwis along for the ride

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck at his firm's mission control room in Auckland. Photo / Dean Purcell Rocket Lab shares jumped 9.03% today to US$38.88, giving the Nasdaq-listed, Kiwi-American firm an all-time high valuation of US$17.94 billion ($30.48b). Forbes accordingly bumped founder Sir Peter Beck’s estimated wealth (based on his 10.5% Rocket Lab stake) by 9% or US$164m to US$2.0b on its real-time net-worth tracker. While most of Beck’s wealth is tied up in his firm, he sold a parcel of shares worth US$20.2m in 2023 to capitalise his charitable foundation. The former Fisher and Paykel Appliances apprentice has also invested in numerous Kiwi start-ups at key points in their life, including Halter, Partly, Foundry Lab, Astrix Astronautics and HeartLab. It’s not just about Beck’s bank account, however. When Rocket Lab began its bull run midway through last year, Sharesies said around 20,000 Kiwis owned shares in the firm through its fractional ownership platform. This morning, co-founder Leighton Roberts said the number has hit 32,000. The average buy price in the volatile stock is US$12.76, Roberts says. Sharesies also recently added Rocket Lab to the list of US stocks eligible for its self-select KiwiSaver scheme, which sees customers choose a base fund, with the option to add various individual stocks or exchange-traded funds. “Several hundred” self-select customers had already added Rocket Lab to their KiwiSaver mix, Roberts told the Herald. Rocket Lab’s share price is now running ahead of analysts’ valuations. According to a Wall Street Journal summary, there are 10 analysts with a “buy” rating on Rocket Lab, with one “overweight” and four giving the stock a “hold”. None of the 15 analysts covering the stock have an “underweight” or “sell” rating. The average 12-month target price is US$32.18 (with a low of US$20.00 and a high of US$45.00). Two interrelated factors are behind the stock’s recent surge. One is SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s fallout with Donald Trump - which has seen the US President withdraw the nomination of Musk ally Jared Isaacman to be the new head of Nasa (the US space agency being one of the biggest customers of both SpaceX and Rocket Lab). Trump has also threatened to cancel SpaceX’s Government contracts. At the same time, Rocket Lab is building up to the first test launch of its much larger, crew-capable rocket, the Neutron - which will put it toe to toe with SpaceX for the first time. Rocket Lab has started to sign up the first Neutron customers to its US$1b-plus order book, which was opened after the US election in late 2024. Key clients, including various defence agencies, want competition. Things looked darker as Musk emerged as Trump’s right-hand man, at the same time as SpaceX was pushing for billions more in Federal funding. Now, the stars are more aligned to Beck’s firm. While Neutron will only launch from the US, the giant new rocket forms only half of Rocket Lab’s growth story. The firm is also banking on further growth in its space systems business, including satellite components being manufactured at its expanded Auckland facility. In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX - buoyed at the time by Musk’s then-close relationship with Elon Musk - had a US$350b private equity valuation. Beck’s company is the only other private player to stage regular launches, but Musk’s firm is still far ahead. SpaceX, which also owns the Starlink satellite network, staged 138 launches in 2024 to Rocket Lab’s 16. Jeff Bezos’ New Origin - currently best-known for its near-space tourist jaunts - is also gearing up for a medium-lift push. Things have also turned out better than originally anticipated for US solar and wind farm operator Longroad Energy, 37% owned by NZX-listed Infratil. Jarden analysts said the final form of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” was less bad for the clean energy sector than Infratil had anticipated. Arie Dekker and Grant Swanepoel maintained their buy rating and hiked Infratil’s 12-month target price from $10.77 to $14.31 (shares were recently trading at $10.96 (other recent developments have included a 1% fall in CDC’s independent valuation and chief executive Jason Boyes buying $1.25m worth of stock). The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provided US$369 billion ($621b) to spur green infrastructure and decarbonisation, was a Biden centrepiece. Trump campaigned on a promise to gut the legislation, which he called “the green scam”, and withhold US$104b in IRA funds yet to be allocated. In its last annual report, written before Trump’s election, Infratil took a punt on political commentary. “More than 80% of the investment in large-scale clean energy and semiconductor manufacturing pledged since the passage of the IRA and the Chips and Science Act will go to Republican congressional districts. Even if Republicans controlled the Federal government, many in the party may view reversing the IRA as too politically risky.” That turned out to be largely prescient. The original “Big Beautiful Bill” gave energy firms 60 days after its passing to begin new projects, thus securing IRA tax credits. Now, after watering down in the Senate, the final “Big Beautiful Bill” gives Longroad and its peers 12 months to start a new project. It’s a complex set-up but Jarden’s read is that Longroad and its peers will be able to “safe harbour” or claim full IRA tax credits until “well beyond 2027″. For Boston-based Longroad - Infratil’s third-largest asset after CDC and One NZ, with a $2.1b fair value - those new projects will include a contract with Meta, signed in December, to supply the Facebook owner with 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of renewable electricity to support its data centre operations. It’s a similar story for Allbirds, with its Trump impact bad, but a lot less bad than it initially seemed. In May, Allbirds - the producer of sustainable footwear and activewear made from New Zealand merino wool, co-founded by ex-All White Tim Brown - reported another big loss and another big fall in revenue. But it forecast a return to revenue growth in the final quarter of this year, subject to no more external shocks - and Vietnam, home to nearly all of its manufacturing, succeeding in keeping tariffs on its exports to the US at a 10% “pause” level, rather than the 46% initially slapped on the country on Trump’s “Liberation Day”. A US-Vietnam preliminary trade deal announced overnight set a 20% tariff for Vietnam imports (compared to a pre-Trump average of 10%). Allbirds had braced for the worst, announcing a new US$75m revolving credit facility on June 30. The firm had no immediate statement but its need to draw on the new credit line seems less pressing now than anticipated. Its shares, which dived to US$4.39 after “Liberation Day” have staged a sharp recovery over recent weeks and were recently trading at US$10.54.

The Veterans Affairs Department will reduce staff by 30,000 through retirements. This avoids large layoffs initially planned. Veterans groups and Congress worried about the impact on veteran care. The VA assures safeguards are in place to protect services. Staff reductions happened through attrition and a hiring freeze. Secretary Collins says performance is improving despite fewer employees.

July 07, 2025 19:17 ET | Source: Portnoy Law Portnoy Law Investors can contact the law firm at no cost to learn more about recovering their losses LOS ANGELES, July 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. ("DoubleVerify" or the "Company") (NYSE: DV) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). DoubleVerify investors have until July 21, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. provides media effectiveness platforms that help advertisers optimize digital ad performance. According to the class action lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material facts, including that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting ad spending away from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the company’s technological capabilities were limited and faced direct competition from native tools offered by platforms such as Meta and Amazon; (ii) developing DoubleVerify’s technology for these closed platforms was far more costly and time-consuming than represented to investors; (iii) monetization of Activation Services on closed platforms would take several years, contrary to defendants’ suggestions; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to implement AI solutions on closed platforms, impairing DoubleVerify’s competitiveness and profitability; (v) the company systematically overbilled customers for ad impressions served to known bots operating from data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially misleading by presenting already occurring issues as hypothetical risks. The lawsuit further alleges a series of corrective disclosures that negatively impacted the company’s stock price: February 28, 2024: DoubleVerify issued lower-than-expected Q1 2024 revenue growth guidance, citing a “slow start by brand advertisers” and slow onboarding of new customers. On this news, the stock dropped over 21%. May 7, 2024: DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook, attributing the change to reduced ad spending by customers. The stock declined nearly 39% following this announcement. February 27, 2025: DoubleVerify reported disappointing Q4 2024 earnings and sales, revealing that the shift from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the company. On this news, shares fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.

Title: Will food delivery robots be a success in the U.S.?

Time Published: 2025-07-07T22:20:29Z
Full Content:
Food delivery robots carrying everything from pizza to hamburgers are trying their luck on city streets and college campuses. It’s not clear if it is the future or a hilarious misstep. Visitors to Hollywood have probably seen them around, where they have been in operation since 2020, but there’s now an effort to spread usage to college towns. The Wall Street Journal wrote about how the robots are getting flipped over, stuck in snow piles and some students have been found to sit on them, or trip over them, when drinking. Companies like Coco Robotics, which makes food robots, noted they are a huge hit on social media, and kids find them cute. Tokyo also has seen a growth in food robots but, in general, has residents who are more respectful of the robots and it seems to be going a little better than U.S. college campuses. Question: Will food delivery robots be a success in the U.S.? Caroline Freund, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy YES: If you build them, they will deliver. When Uber launched the first U.S. ride-hailing app in 2009, people asked who would get in the personal car of a stranger? Uber’s market cap is now nearly $200 billion. Americans love food delivery. Where labor is scarce, streets are easy to navigate, and people are hungry, robots will thrive. College campuses are great places to innovate, expand and refine service. Kelly Cunningham, San Diego Institute for Economic Research YES: Deliveries by robots certainly have potential to work well, particularly in congested urban areas having access provided by ADA compliant streets and buildings as well as ability to enter elevators. They clearly need some form of security as they inevitably will be misused, perhaps like Tesla cars having cameras to record vandalizing and to prevent misappropriating of their operations. Flying drones may avoid some problems navigating terrestrial obstacles and potentially be less intrusive and faster. Alan Gin, University of San Diego YES: There are some current problems, but the technology will undoubtedly get better in the future. Some Americans like the convenience of having their food delivered, and the food robots can do it at a lower cost than delivery services. Yes, college students may drink too much and try to abuse the robots, but that is likely to decrease as the novelty of the robots wears off and they become a more accepted part of life. David Ely, San Diego State University YES: College campuses, resorts and dense urban areas would seem to provide a suitable environment in which food delivery robots can be successful. There are many prospective customers in these markets who will appreciate the convenience and novelty of this innovation. Delivery via robot can be less expensive than alternatives that require a human. Experience will soon allow businesses to determine the distances, sidewalk conditions, regulatory constraints and weather conditions where robots can be successful. Ray Major, economist YES: But not in their current form, the current tech needs more time to mature. Think of this as a V1.0 of a generic personalized delivery service. As with many V1.0s, the concept is ahead of its time, and its implementation needs to be refined. Inventions like Apple’s Newton laid the foundation for iPhones. Segways failed, but in another form became e-bikes and set the stage for micro-mobility. Give it a few years and it might compete with Amazon. James Hamilton, UC San Diego YES: At least in some settings. In controlled environments like college campuses, hospitals and large corporate complexes delivery robots are already proving to be successful. The extent to which they can succeed in tougher urban environments is another question. They pose a new potential sidewalk hazard for the elderly and those of us with disabilities. And it’s yet another step leading people to greater social isolation with less interaction with real humans. Norm Miller, University of San Diego YES: Eventually these will be perfected and become part of normal operations, just as self-driving cars are inevitable. I’ve seen them used in Asian restaurants. I once had tenants that stole every campus machine not bolted down, and if these guys are not in jail, then the challenge for U.S. public delivery robots is that they are too easy to steal from, or abuse, and none, at present, have any defense mode like electric-shocks. Hmmm? Chris Van Gorder, Scripps Health YES: I don’t know if they will be successful in the general populations just like I’m not sure drones will be either, but in select communities like college campuses or major business campuses, they could be quite helpful and efficient. Scripps has been using food delivery robots or “TUGs” to deliver patient meals to different nursing units at Scripps La Jolla for years and it’s likely the use of these robots will be expanded in years to come. Phil Blair, Manpower YES: The U.S. will become early adopters of any technology that improves service and saves money. Jamie Moraga, Franklin Revere NO: Like the Bird and Lime e-scooters, these “cute” food delivery robots are likely to face significant challenges. While the intention is good and the concept promising, the reality is that these robots will be vandalized, damaged, robbed or intentionally destroyed. Additionally, they could pose liability issues and dangers to walkways and roadways, not to mention the threat of overregulation by local municipalities. The U.S. still has a way to go before food delivery robots can be successful. Gary London, London Moeder Advisors YES: I’ve seen them in Westwood (Los Angeles) and New York City. Early autos were probably targeted by horse and carriage people. Once the novelty wears off and delivery robots become ubiquitous, I’m sure they will just blend into the urban fabric. Change is hard, but the combination of densification in the cities, labor costs and technological advances makes them inevitable. We will eventually see a coupling of autonomous vehicles and robotics deliver to the suburbs, as well. Bob Rauch, R.A. Rauch & Associates YES: Food delivery robots are already gaining significant traction in the U.S., particularly in urban areas such as Los Angeles, San Jose and Dallas. Companies like Uber Eats and Serve Robotics have deployed over 2,000 delivery bots. Each of our hotels has a “service robot” for food, beverages and supplies, and customer satisfaction is high. Delivery speed and cost efficiency are improving, which is critical since uninformed politicians want to raise the minimum wage by 45%. Austin Neudecker, Weave Growth YES: Robot couriers may stumble today, but over a longer horizon, their spread feels inevitable. Early pilots will hit curbs, pranksters and regulatory roadblocks. Many will fail. Yet technology improves rapidly, labor continues to tighten, and consumers expect increased convenience. There will be a period of adaptation and acclimation for a diverse population, spanning early users to luddites. Ultimately, simple economics will prevail. Expect a messy adjustment marred by layoffs, zoning fights and skepticism. Have an idea for an Econometer question? Email me at phillip.molnar@sduniontribune.com. Follow me on Threads: @phillip020

Title: Chris Hedges: Profiting From Genocide

Time Published: 2025-07-07T20:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Activism Chris Hedges, ScheerPost War is a business. So is genocide. The latest report submitted by Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as Blackrock, insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. The report, which includes a database of over 1,000 corporate entities that collaborate with Israel, demands these firms and institutions sever ties with Israel or be held accountable for complicity in war crimes. It describes “Israel’s “forever-occuption” as “the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors and private and public institutions profit freely.” The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission laid the legal framework for recognizing the criminal responsibility of institutions and businesses that participate in international crimes. This new report makes clear that decisions made by the International Court of Justice place an obligation on entities “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure that any engagement with Palestinians enables their self-determination.” “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative, it’s profitable for far too many,” Albanese told me. “It’s a business. There are corporate entities, including from Palestine-friendly states, who have for decades made businesses and made profits out of the economy of the occupation. Israel has always exploited Palestinian land, resources and Palestinian life. The profits have continued and even increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into an economy of genocide.” In addition, she said, Palestinians have provided “boundless training fields to test the technologies, test weapons, to test surveillance techniques that now are being used against people everywhere from the Global South to the Global North.” You can see my interview with Albanese here. The report lambasts corporations for “providing Israel with the weapons and machinery required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship, livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards.” The Palestinian territory, the report notes, is a “captive market” because of Israeli-imposed restrictions on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and water for colonies. Corporations have profiteered from this “captive market” by “exploiting Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural resources, building and powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods and services in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and globally.” “Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at least 35 per cent of its GDP,” the report notes. Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers have “channeled finance into the illegal occupation,” the report charges. In addition, “universities — centres of intellectual growth and power — have sustained the political ideology underpinning the colonization of Palestinian land, developed weaponry and overlooked or even endorsed systemic violence, while global research collaborations have obscured Palestinian erasure behind a veil of academic neutrality.” Surveillance and incarceration technologies have “evolved into tools for indiscriminate targeting of the Palestinian population,” the report notes. “Heavy machinery previously used for house demolitions, infrastructure destruction and resource seizure in the West Bank have been repurposed to obliterate the urban landscape of Gaza, preventing displaced populations from returning and reconstituting as a community.” The military assault on the Palestinians has also “provided testing grounds for cutting-edge military capabilities: air defense platforms, drones, targeting tools powered by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United States of America. These technologies are then marketed as ‘battle proven.’” Since 2020, Israel has been the eighth largest arms exporter in the world. Its two biggest weapons companies are Elbit Systems Ltd and the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). It has a series of international partnerships with foreign weapons firms, including “for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United States-based Lockheed Martin.” “Components and parts constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet, which Israel customizes and maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and domestic companies.” the report reads. Since October 2023, F-35s and F-16s jets have been “integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.” “Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines in the skies of Gaza,” the report reads. “Drones largely developed and supplied by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries have long flown alongside fighter jets, surveilling Palestinians and delivering target intelligence. In the past two decades, with support from these companies and collaborations with institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drones used by Israel acquired automated weapons systems and the ability to fly in swarm formation.” Japan’s FANUC companies sell automation products and “provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for IAI, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.” “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller — Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post-October 2023.” There was a “65 per cent surge in Israeli military spending from 2023 to 2024 – amounting to $46.5 billion, one of the highest per capita worldwide.” This “generated a sharp surge in their annual profits,” while “Foreign arms companies, especially producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.” At the same time, tech companies have profited from the genocide by “providing dual-use infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the occupied Palestinian territory.” They enhance “carceral and surveillance services, from closed-circuit television (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced tech checkpoint networks, ‘smart walls’ and drone surveillance, to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and data analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.” “Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy,” the report reads, “as the NSO Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did. Its Pegasus spyware, designed for covert smartphone surveillance, has been used against Palestinian activists and licensed globally to target leaders, journalists and human rights defenders. Exported under the Defense Export Control Law, NSO group surveillance technology enables ‘spyware diplomacy’ while reinforcing State impunity.” IBM, whose technology facilitated Nazi Germany’s generation and tabulation of punched cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics, train traffic management and concentration camp capacity, is once again a partner in this current genocide. It has operated in Israel since 1972. It provides training for Israeli military and intelligence agencies, especially Unit 8200, which is responsible for clandestine operations, the collection of signal intelligence and code decryption, along with counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, military intelligence and surveillance. “Since 2019, IBM Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the Population and Immigration Authority, enabling collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit regime of Israel,” the report notes. Microsoft, active in Israel since 1989, is “embedded in the prison service, police, universities and schools — including in colonies. Microsoft has been integrating its systems and civilian tech across the Israeli military since 2003, while acquiring Israeli cybersecurity and surveillance start-ups.” “As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown,” the report reads. “In 2021, Israel awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a $1.2 billion contract (Project Nimbus) — largely funded through Ministry of Defense expenditure — to provide core tech infrastructure.” Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon “grant Israel virtually government-wide access to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing, decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities.” The Israeli military, the report points out, “has developed artificial intelligence systems such as‘Lavender,’ ‘Gospel’ and ‘Where’s Daddy?’ to process data and generate lists of targets, reshaping modern warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature of artificial intelligence.” There are “reasonable grounds,” the report reads, to believe that Palantir Technology Inc., which has a long relationship with Israel, “has provided automatic predictive policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction and deployment of military software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows real-time battlefield data integration for automated decision-making.” Palantir’s CEO in April 2025 responded to accusations that Palantir kills Palestinians in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true.” “Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial occupation,” the report reads. “Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment from leading global manufacturers to ‘unground’ Palestinians from their land, demolishing homes, public buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure. Since October 2023, this machinery has been integral to damaging and destroying 70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of cropland in Gaza.” Caterpillar Inc. has for decades provided the Israeli military with equipment used to demolish Palestinian homes, mosques, hospitals as well as “burying alive wounded Palestinians,” and killed activists, such as Rachel Corrie. “Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the Israeli military, deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralizing’ the territory and killing Palestinians,” the report reads. This year, Caterpillar “secured a further multi-millionaire dollar contract with Israel.” “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially-owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been linked to destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through exclusively licensed Israeli dealers,” the report reads. “As corporate actors have contributed to the destruction of Palestinian life in the occupied Palestinian territory, they have also helped construction of what replaces it: building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading materials, energy and agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies as if to a regular holiday destination.” “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the report concludes. These building projects have used Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators and heavy equipment. Hanson Israel, a subsidiary of the German Heidelberg Materials AG, “has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank.” The quarried dolomite is used to construct Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Foreign firms have also “contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians.” Global real estate companies sell properties in colonial settlements to Israeli and international buyers. These real estate firms include Keller Williams Realty LLC, which has “had branches based in the colonies” through its Israeli franchisee KW Israel. Last year through another franchisee called Home in Israel, Keller Williams “ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.” Rental platforms, including Booking.com and Airbnb, list properties and hotel rooms in illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food conglomerate, which utilizes land seized from Palestinians in the West Bank. In the energy sector, “Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMedEnergy (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan.” BP and Chevron also serve as “the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude oil, as major owners of the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium, respectively, and of their associated oil fields. Each conglomerate effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil between October 2023 and July 2024, supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian oil fields, in which Petrobras holds the largest stakes, and military jet fuel. Oil from these companies supplies two refineries in Israel.” “By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing to civilian infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation and now weaponizes in the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza,” the report reads. “The same infrastructure that these companies supply resources into has serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven obliteration of Gaza. ” International banks and financial firms have also sustained the genocide through the purchase of Israeli treasury bonds. “As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have played a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza,” the report reads. “From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8 per cent deficit. Israel funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance, including $8 billion in March 2024 and $5 billion in February 2025, alongside issuances on its domestic new shekel market.” The report notes that some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, “stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms — including Blackrock ($68 million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960 million) — were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them.” Faith-based charities have “also become key financial enablers of illegal projects, including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions abroad despite strict regulatory charitable frameworks,” the report reads. “The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over 20 affiliates fund settler expansion and military-linked projects,” the report reads. “Since October 2023, platforms such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible crowdfunding in 32 countries for Israeli military units and settlers. The United States-based Christian Friends of Israeli Communities, Dutch Christians for Israel and global affiliates, sent over $12.25 million in 2023 to various projects that support colonies, including some that train extremist settlers.” The report criticizes universities that partner with Israeli universities and institutions. It notes that labs at MIT “conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.” These projects include “drone swarm control — a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023 — pursuit algorithms, and underwater surveillance.” You can see my interview with the MIT students who exposed the collaboration between the university Israeli military here. Genocide requires a vast network and billions of dollars to sustain it. Israel could not carry out its mass slaughter of the Palestinians without this ecosystem. These entities, which profit from industrial violence against the Palestinians and mass displacement, are as guilty of genocide as the Israeli militray units decimating the people in Gaza. They too are war criminals, They too must be held accountable. Activism Activism Activism Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Any dip in Nvidia stock is most likely a buying opportunity. This article isn’t about Nvidia’s parabolic rise amid the AI boom. It won’t dwell on the well-known fact that Nvidia’s GPUs power roughly 90% of AI data centers worldwide or that tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta remain deeply invested in its silicon innovations. It’s not even about CUDA, Nvidia’s giant competitive moat that is still relevant today. Nor will we focus on how the stock struggled earlier this year, as investors kept raising the bar, until even spectacular results weren’t good enough. And yet, Nvidia has not only reclaimed its top spot, it is trading at record highs. The trillion-dollar question now is: Can Nvidia stock reach $200 by year-end? Or is that a stretch even for a strong compounder like the AI bellwether? On June 25, 2025, Nvidia surged over 4%, closing at a record $154.31, reclaiming its spot as the most valuable publicly traded company (~$3.77 trillion market cap), surpassing Microsoft and Apple. The stock is even higher now, and the last closing price is $159.34, marking a stellar comeback, from Nvidia’s April 4th closing low of $94.30. Nvidia stock erased more than 40% of its value between February and April of this year, not because of any failing on its part. Concerns over moderating AI spending, and unpredictable tariff policies triggered the decline. This is not Nvidia’s first rodeo either. Prior to that, DeepSeek revelations in late January created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day. The market was simply recalibrating its perception of perfection. While DeepSeek showed promise, it is nowhere in the leagues of an established AI leader like Nvidia. So, the sell-off was unjustified in my opinion. The Nvidia stock bounced back within a month. Last year too, Nvidia shares fell nearly 23% from mid-July through early August, closing August 7th trade at $98.88. The sell-off was triggered by fears that Nvidia’s big tech customers may trim their AI spending budgets. However, Nvidia stock staged a strong recovery of more than 30% from these low levels, closing August 19 at nearly $130. Every time a quality stock drops, the internet floods with "Should you buy the dip?" takes. My view is simple: Study the cause. If the sell-off happened for reasons that can be fixed – go ahead and buy. But if it stems from deeper, structural weaknesses, then walk away. It’s not like there’s only one good stock out there. Nvidia’s deeply integrated AI ecosystem gives it a wide berth over competition, and its innovation remains unsurpassed. Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. That said, investor perception is everything when it comes to stock pricing. The recent rally has given reason to hope that the market may be finally waking up to the true value of this stock following a period of inflated expectations and sharp corrections.The fear of missing out (FOMO) is likely to keep the buying pressure active and drive NVDA to at least $180 by the end of this year. Of course, I could be wrong. China is a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened dramatically from 95% before 2022, to 50% currently, after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. To comply with the U.S. export curbs, Nvidia has been selling H20 to China. H20 is a watered-down version of its H100 chips with significantly lower computing power. However, in April, the U.S. government tightened restrictions again, reclassifying even the scaled-down H20 as requiring an export license. The decision effectively halted shipments and dealt Nvidia a serious financial blow. CEO Jensen Huang put it bluntly: “The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China.” Calling the $50 billion Chinese AI chip market “effectively closed to the U.S. industry,” Huang also warned that if U.S. export restrictions continue, more Chinese customers will turn to Huawei's chips. I highlighted this risk in a previous article that flagged both the threat of an H20 ban and Huawei’s preparation for competitive positioning, citing Jefferies and WSJ reports. Nvidia recognized $4.6 billion in H20 revenue prior to April 9, before the new export restrictions kicked in. The financial fallout from the ban was significant. Nvidia wrote down $4.5 billion in unsold H20 inventory for the first quarter, and was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of what would have been H20-generated revenue. Gross margin fell to 61%, versus the 71.3% it would have reported without the China-related charges. In an interview with the Stratechery podcast in May, Huang also revealed the company had to walk away from an additional $15 billion of sales. The topline guidance of $45 billion for the July quarter, would have been higher by $8 billion, but for the new export restrictions. So, why is there still hope for a China rebound for Nvidia? Nvidia is pivoting swiftly. A Reuters report citing sources familiar to the matter said Nvidia is planning to build a GPU or graphics processing unit for China based on its latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors that will be priced at $6,500-8,000, well below the H20’s price range of $10,000-$12,000. The lower price could reflect the new export limits on GPU memory bandwidth – a metric crucial for AI workloads that require extensive data processing. Also, recent developments suggest a thaw in the U.S.’s formerly hardline stance against China, signaling a broader shift in tone This gives rise to a key question: In this more conciliatory phase, is there any possibility that the U.S. could revisit its chip export restrictions to China as well? The New York Times reported on June 27th that China confirmed details of a trade framework with the Trump administration. “China will review and approve applications for the export of controlled items,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, and “the United States will correspondingly cancel a series of restrictive measures it has taken against China.” While specifics remain vague, the framework hints at a meaningful de-escalation. The most compelling driver behind this shift? Not a change of heart, just China’s dominance in rare earth elements – critical for semiconductors, robotics and aerospace applications. This accord between the U.S. and China, includes the latter’s commitment to deliver rare earth, in exchange for the U.S. lifting its export curbs on ethane, chip software and jet engines. As trade talks evolve, Beijing is not above deploying its rare earth “Trump card” to reopen access to restricted U.S. AI chip technologies. If the U.S. should revise or relax chip export policies or greenlight a new line of compliant processors, Nvidia could regain access to the highly lucrative market. Such a development would materially bolster the case for Nvidia hitting $200 by year’s end. However, even without China, Nvidia remains on solid footing, thanks to its ability to innovate relentlessly. Nvidia’s growth story is deeply structural, spanning beyond GPUs to hyperscaler ramp-ups, AI factories, sovereign AI, Networking, gaming, cybersecurity and self-driving cars. Nvidia isn’t just firing on all cylinders – it is building entirely new growth engines. Blackwell’s Blockbuster Ramp: In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia’s data center revenue surged 73% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $39 billion, with compute revenue accounting for $34.2 billion, up 76% y-o-y. At the heart of this explosive growth lies Blackwell, the fastest-ramping architecture in Nvidia’s history. AI Factories and Sovereign AI: As nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack, Sovereign AI is a solid growth engine for the AI bellwether. Nvidia has sovereign AI deals in place with Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the UAE. AI factory build-outs are driving significant revenue for Nvidia with deployments at AT&T, BYD, Capital One, Foxconn, MediaTek and Telenor. The count of Nvidia-powered AI factories doubled y-o-y to roughly 100 in the first quarter, with the average number of GPUs powering each factory also doubling in the same period. Nvidia’s new Spectrum-X and Quantum-X silicon photonics switches will enable next-level AI factory scaling to millions of GPUs. These switches offer 3.5x greater power efficiency, 10x higher network resiliency and accelerate customer time-to-market by 1.3x. Other revenue drivers: This brings us to networking, which is shaping up as a critical contributor for Nvidia with first-quarter networking revenue reaching nearly $5 billion, up 56% y-o-y and 64% sequentially. Networking growth was driven by NVLink, with Q1 shipments exceeding $1 billion. Hyperscale customers can now build semi-custom CCUs and accelerators that connect directly to the Nvidia platform with NVLink. Also helping networking growth is the continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions. Spectrum X – which is the world’s first Ethernet networking platform for AI – is now annualizing over $8 billion in revenue with deployments across Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Meta, Google Cloud and xAI. For AI-powered cybersecurity – Checkpoint, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are using NVIDIA’s AI security and software stack to build, optimize and secure agentic workflows. CrowdStrike, for instance, has achieved 2x faster detection triage with 50% fewer compute resources. Gaming revenue for the first quarter was a record $3.8 billion, up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, driven by sales of the Blackwell architecture. Professional Visualization revenue, which includes Nvidia Omniverse, rose 19% from a year ago to $509 million, thanks to broader adoption of Ada RTX workstation GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation. Automotive and Robotics revenue rose 72% to $567 million from a year ago, driven by sales of Nvidia’s self-driving platforms. Most recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang identified robotics as the company’s next biggest growth opportunity after AI, noting that self-driving cars are likely to be the first major commercial application of this technology. Even at record highs, Nvidia’s stock may not be as expensive as it is touted to be. Some valuation metrics suggest room for upside: Interestingly, those discount levels align closely with the roughly 25-30% upside Nvidia would need to reach $200. That leaves the question less about if Nvidia can reach $200 and more about when investors will be ready to price that in. So, what are analysts saying about the Nvidia stock? Nvidia currently has a “Strong Buy” rating with a 12-month price target of $174 per share. Loop Capital lifted its price target for Nvidia to $250 from $175, while maintaining its "buy" rating. The rating firm’s client note said, "Our work suggests we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger-than-anticipated demand.” Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Buy rating with a $200 target, citing robust fundamentals and strong growth expectations through 2025 and especially in 2026. A few Bumps on Nvidia's road to $200 include: Bottom line In my opinion, Nvidia stock is likely to reach at least $180 by year-end, supported by a re-rating in its forward PEG to around 1.47, if market sentiment continues to remain constructive. Key catalysts will be earnings announcements for the rest of the year, but it all boils down to market perception. Nvidia can continue to generate stellar results, and if that fails to align with already-high investor expectations, Nvidia stock could pause or pull back. That said, for the long-term, Nvidia is a structural compounder with deeply embedded growth levers and robust AI tailwinds. Any dip in the stock is most likely a buying opportunity. If there is any change in China export policy, the Nvidia stock could achieve its $180 target even sooner and be well on its way to $200 by year-end.

Title: Citibank Raises Price Target for One Tech Stock That’s in Global Race for AI Infrastructure: Report

Traders at Citi are building conviction for a “Magnificent 7” stock that they say is competing in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race. The bank says that a major bump in the demand for AI infrastructure, especially sovereign governments looking to build national plants, is bullish for Nvidia (NVDA), Yahoo Finance reports. Say Citi analysts Atif Malik and Papa Syll, “We believe sovereign demand is already contributing up to billions of dollars in 2025 [and will rise more in 2026].” The analysts note that “essentially every sovereign deal” involves Nvidia, putting the company in a central position in the race for AI infrastructure. “Nvidia has line of sight to tens of gigawatts of sovereign and enterprise AI factory buildouts over the next few years.” Citi is forecasting a 5% growth in Nvidia’s revenue for fiscal year 2027, and 11% in 2028, and has currently raised its price target for NVDA to $190, a 20% rally from current prices. In a recent interview with CNBC, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that despite the tariff war and geopolitical uncertainty, retail investors had been using the trading platform to accumulate most of the classic favorites as before, one of which was NVDA. “And if we look at retail, retail has pretty much continued to buy the names that they were buying previously. So heavy in the AI space with companies like Nvidia, Tesla, electric vehicles, big in crypto and fintech-related companies. So it’s very much long innovation. Some companies like Palantir, obviously in the defense space, continue to be retail favorites, but that was always the case, that’s been the case for many, many years. So I would interpret it as retail is sort of moving on ahead investing.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai The SaaS sector experienced a dramatic bifurcation in the first half of 2025, with clear winners and losers emerging based on AI differentiation, security positioning, and vertical specialization. While the broader S&P 500 gained approximately 5-6% YTD, SaaS performance ranged from spectacular gains of nearly 80% to significant declines of -30% (or more). Market Drivers: The performance spread of over 95 percentage points between top performers (~80%) and worst performers (-43%) highlighted the market’s demand for innovation and differentiation in an increasingly competitive landscape. How AI Led Palantir From Slow Growth (13%) to Hypergrowth (49%!) The SaaS market in 1H’25 showed clear bifurcation between companies with compelling AI differentiation (70%+ gains) and traditional enterprise software (single-digit or negative returns). Security and data infrastructure companies emerged as the biggest winners, while general productivity and communication tools lagged significantly. Bottom Line: Success in 2025 required either mission-critical positioning (security, data), clear AI differentiation (Palantir), or deep vertical specialization (Veeva, Guidewire). Generic horizontal tools and traditional enterprise software struggled to gain investor confidence despite solid operational performance. Data sources: Live stock performance data verified through multiple financial platforms as of July 2025 While we’ve focused on the SaaS bifurcation between AI winners and traditional enterprise software strugglers, there’s an important counterpoint worth highlighting: Oracle Corporation (ORCL). The 47-year-old database giant delivered a stunning +41% YTD performance, reaching $234.22 and a market cap of $658 billion. Oracle proves that legacy doesn’t have to mean left behind. 🤖 AI Infrastructure Positioning: Rather than trying to become an AI company, Oracle positioned itself as the essential infrastructure backbone for AI workloads. Their database and cloud services became indispensable for companies building AI applications. ☁️ Cloud Migration Momentum: Oracle’s aggressive cloud transformation finally gained enterprise traction, with customers migrating mission-critical workloads that competitors couldn’t easily displace. 💾 Data as the Moat: While others chased AI features, Oracle doubled down on what it does best—managing enterprise data at scale.

Title: Coffee Break: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Good Money After Bad

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is upping the ante in the AI business, triggering a bidding war for talent and he’s willing to poach from competitors. Why? Well, like most of us, Mark is in hot pursuit of Godlike super intelligence. pic.twitter.com/0MqEqiiKpK — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 Perfectly rational man in a perfectly rational society that has truly mastered rational resource allocation. pic.twitter.com/H58LvHoh7S — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 Ed Zitron summed up Zuckerberg’s recent moves and his overall strategy: Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, my previous subject in this King Idiots of AI mini-series squealed like a stuck pig: pic.twitter.com/LXfthZ4STJ — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 5, 2025 I really should quote a little from the NY Times piece I referenced above: In April, Meta released two new versions of Llama, asserting that the models performed as well as or better than comparable ones from OpenAI and Google. To prove its claim, Meta cited its own testing benchmarks. On Instagram, Mr. Zuckerberg championed the releases in a video selfie. But some independent researchers quickly deduced that Meta’s benchmarks were designed to make one of its models look more advanced than it was. They became incensed. Mr. Zuckerberg later learned that his A.I. team had wanted the models to appear to perform well, even though they were not doing as well as hoped, people with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Zuckerberg was not briefed on the customized tests and was upset, two people said. His solution was to throw more bodies at the problem. Meta’s A.I. division swelled to more than 1,000 people this year, up from a few hundred two years earlier. The rapid growth led to infighting and management squabbles. And with Mr. Zuckerberg’s round-the-clock, hard-charging management style — his attention on a project is often compared to the “Eye of Sauron” internally, a reference to the “Lord of the Rings” villain — some engineers burned out and left. Executives hunkered down to brainstorm next steps, including potentially ratcheting back investment in Llama. In fairness to Meta, the NYT failed to mention that Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, said that it’s “simply not true” that Meta trained its Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout models on “test sets.” And if you can’t trust the fine folks at Meta, who can you trust? But I don’t want to dismiss Zuckerberg too cavalierly. I’m a serial sucker taking things at face value, investing based on business fundamentals and underlying product value, and betting on professional wrestling. He’s a stone playa who read the true nature of this society at a very early age, from The Harvard Crimson, 2003: The creator of the short-lived but popular Harvard version of the Am I Hot or Not? website said he will not have to leave school after being called before the Administrative Board yesterday afternoon. Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06 said he was accused of breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy by creating the website, www.facemash.com, about two weeks ago. The charges were based on a complaint from the computer services department over his unauthorized use of on-line facebook photographs, he said. Zuckerberg said he will not be forced to withdraw or leave school for any amount of time, but declined to elaborate on whether the board took some lesser action. …“I understood that some parts were still a little sketchy and I wanted some more time to think about whether or not this was really appropriate to release to the Harvard community,” Zuckerberg wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson earlier this month. After taking it down, Zuckerberg decided that criticism of the site was too strong to re-post it. “Issues about violating people’s privacy don’t seem to be surmountable,” he wrote at that point. “I’m not willing to risk insulting anyone.” The site was created entirely by Zuckerberg over the last week in October, after a friend gave him the idea. The website used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the “hotter” person. Students were ranked within the general Harvard community and individual Houses according to attractiveness. Zuckerberg hacked into House websites to gather the photos, and then wrote the codes to compute rankings after every vote. The programming and algorithms that made the site function were Zuckerberg’s primary interest in creating it, he said. After creating the website, Zuckerberg forwarded the link to a few friends for advice. But the link then was sent out on several campus group list-serves, and traffic skyrocketed. In the course of one day, the number of visitors quadrupled—by 10 p.m., the site had been visited by 450 people, who voted at least 22,000 times. The part I love about the story above is the way Zuckerberg is the only source quoted. Those Harvard educated journalists are allowed to be awful from the get. She also didn’t report the blog post he put up the night he launched the site: “I’m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even 10 p.m. and it’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland [dorm] facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive. By the time of his 2018 congressional testimony Zuck had gotten some press training: Zuckerberg, 33, paused and smirked. “No, congressman. FaceMash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,” he said. “You put up two pictures of two women and decided which one was the better, more attractive of the two, is that right?” Long asked. Zuckerberg responded, with an emphasis on his youth at the time: “That is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was a sophomore in college.” Ok, so he’s always been ruthless, shrewd and openly anti-social but I’m not sure he’s really that smart. Social media had been pioneered by MySpace, Friendster and several other companies long before Zuckerberg allegedly stole the idea for Facebook from classmates. Facebook primarily rose to the top because of three factors: Since launching Facebook, his biggest wins have come from buying budding competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp more than from any internally created ideas. Never forget, this is the same guy who spent $47 billion in five years on “the Metaverse.” He clearly cannot tell a good idea from a bad one. He’s explained his recent AI spending spree to investors (who have no ability to depose him) in April: “The major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything we do.” At the same time, Meta upped its capital expenditures range for the year to between $64 billion and $72 billion from between $60 billion and $65 billion to reflect more data center investments in AI and potentially higher hardware costs. What Zuckerberg didn’t say then is that he was about to start shelling out mounds of cash to revamp his AI organization. “Mark Zuckerberg is in founder mode and he’s not going to be stopped,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview on Friday with CNBC’s “Money Movers.” Luria has a buy rating on the stock, but said that to win in AI, Meta needs to be successful with the next round, with the dream team that they’re building.” I had to include the hypersonic quote from D.A. that CNBC featured. I’m sure it made great TV. It wouldn’t be American corporate media if it didn’t feature interchangeable hustlers competing to spout the most ridiculous nonsense in the most simplistic terms. They’re all like a TV sportscaster talking to drunks at noon on a Sunday except with no contract and an urgent need to be invited back right away. Also making me doubt Zuckerberg’s wisdom was his recent, much publicized decision to hire the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s CEO Dana White to be a board member for a reported seven figure stock and cash compensation package. Although there was some logic behind that decision. From The MMA Draw, a publication aimed at investors in the fight sports industry: This well-planned and well-executed attention-getter kicked off Meta’s 2025 with a bang. That’s right, Meta, a company with a $1.59 TRILLION market cap has brought America’s best-known fight promoter (and wife-beater) on their board of directors. The collective “WTF?!?” spawned headlines and social media posts all over the Internet. Based on this round-up of headlines from Google News, the mainstream media already has a theory and it has to do with a certain newly re-elected President celebrating a big anniversary on January 6th. pic.twitter.com/zQb8SgdvWq — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 It’s also, according to The MMA Draw, part of Zuckerberg personally rebranding himself for the Trump era: Reason #2: Zuck Is Getting Based 2024 saw Mark Zuckerberg embark on what Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian called “a wider strategic overhaul of the tech mogul’s public image.” She also explained why Zuckerberg might be doing this: Meta is embroiled in an anti-monopoly lawsuit and is being sued by dozens of states alleging that Facebook and Instagram are exploiting children to boost profits. Far better, don’t you think, that we all talk about how handsome a bearded Zuck would be rather than dwell on Meta’s less attractive business practices? Honestly, it’s been a pretty incredible rebranding campaign for Zuckerberg, scoring wins by showing off his wakeboarding, flag-waving, and beer-drinking mastery. Anyone who remembers Zuckerberg’s pathetic attempt to launch himself as a potential political candidate in 2017 should be impressed by how dramatically he’s improved his PR game. He’s even gotten favorable notice from the Twitter fashion guy. Zuck’s (seemingly genuine) fondness for training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has been a big part of this rebranding and a great excuse to pal around with Dana White. Zuckerberg been talking up his love for BJJ since at least this 2022 appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. Mark Zuckerberg on what he loves about BJJ: (It’s) a thing that is both super engaging physically but also intellectually and where you can’t afford to focus on something else. I think (it’s) the perfect thing because if you stop paying attention for one second you’re gonna end up on the bottom. So I’ve just found that is just really important for me in terms of what I do. Being able to maintain my energy level, maintain my focus… then after an hour or two of working out or rolling or wrestling with friends, now I’m ready to go solve whatever problem at work for the day. Zuckerberg has also medaled in a BJJ tournament and at one point even had Dana White calling up the Roman Colosseum looking for the right venue to host a bout between himself and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Naturally with 2020’s Zuckerberg, even the cage fight was vaporware. Caveat: The Market, aka the most effective price discovery system ever invented disagrees. pic.twitter.com/eGqayBw4If — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 5, 2025 Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. The dual share structure grants him dictatorial powers at Meta, meaning the guy has Imprimatur to do pretty much what he wants, including torching $47bn on what amounted to little more than a personal obsession with the metaverse, memory-holing that episode, and then lining up hundreds of billions more in his continuing quest for a defining “second act” that will secure his place amongst the pantheon of great innovators (as opposed to being known as the guy who stole the idea for facebook from a friend and has since built his empire on strangling emerging competitors in the crib). He’s as desperate for this second act as Trump is for a Nobel Peace Price. His strategy clearly rests on aggregating the critical inputs for AI supremacy ie data (expect Meta’s family of apps to be harvested for every last bit of training data, user privacy be damned), algorithms (Deepseek’s algorithmic breakthroughs shocked SV titans, including MZ, to their core, hence his poaching spree to build bench strength and an AI intellectual aristocracy within Meta to push forward the frontier of algorithmic discovery, which by the way, given Meta’s history, will likely mean just copying whatever the real frontier players are doing) and compute (data centre build out is the sport of kings and given his profligate pursuit of metaverse supremacy, the man can outspend an army of drunken sailors everyday and twice on Sunday). We sure do live in interesting times. https://youtu.be/_v3KiaAjpY8?feature=shared I would recommend this video in full as it does flesh out the whole notion of how one reinvents themselves (or as this video calls it – becoming a new guy) as part of the broadrler topic. It does address Zuck in particular around 42:37. Zuckerberg and the other techbros are looking several steps ahead, but they’re not great at watching their feet. Hey we saw the movie version, Aaron Sorkin on top of every PMC trend. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_social_network It’s not exactly warm and friendly toward Zuck but does seem enamored of Larry Summers. As for Zuckerberg’s trial and error business model that’s so very much a Silicon Valley thing is it not? Musk blows up a giant rocket and just shrugs. break things Contrast with Zuck against say, Bill Gates who quite famously took others ideas or seriously underpaid in hindsight, either is applicable. Good connections and voila, now IBM has a supplier in Microsoft for their software OS on this new idea called the PC…Mark just took the same steps but got to the wealthy billionaire level much quicker. So much to add about my personal experience but I enjoy many of the films directed or helmed by Fincher. Even the occasional dud or a film he disavowed, Alien 3 being a key example. Speaking of the Facebook/Zuck movie, it was recently rated as the 10th best movie of the 21st century by both fans and critics. I mean, I liked the movie OK, but 10th best of the (quarter) century? Not even close, and I don’t watch that many movies. https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/best-movies-21st-century-new-york-times-films-111414429.html I was listening to a podcast about AI and investing. Regardless of what you think about it, it is getting lots of attention from investors that don’t want to be left out. Meaning if you are not investing in it you look like a fool and they will take their money elsewhere. Never mind what China keeps doing with low cost AI. Whether he’s interested or not, he kinda has to go along with the narrative > Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Good Money After Bad #NitPick: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Unearned, Magic Money Made Up Via Market Malfeasance After Bad It’s all Unicorn Rainbow Poop, designed via finacial chicanery to become high powered money. All of it, inflated value made real via stock “money”. That’s why he can pelt it around like tennis balls at a summer carnival trying to win prizes. Ugh. It’s family-blogging tragic when you think about it from the perspective of the public good being laid waste to by the US uni-party. And another “inception” subtext to all this is our collective sanitization of the term “billionaire”, and the notion of “a billion dollars”. And absolutely obscene amount of money that could fuel a thousand lifetimes, sadly made acceptable for one person to have in a single lifetime. #GuillotineWatch lost the last of 3 baby geese. and i stepped on a wire or something in the flooded road(tetanus vaxxed)…so my feets are both wrinkled and one is sorta sore. no other casualties. i am alone with the animals on this place. we’re all good. 23″. since thursday afternoon. 7-7-2025 so heres how it happened for me. july 3rd, afternoon, check weather, as usual. Looks like heavy rain and some flooding…so I decide, after evening chores…critters put up, etc…to sit out at the wilderness bar, drinking beer(started w a margarita(likker first!)) and rolled 4 little joints(lack of proper zigzags), and determined to watch the storm…as is my wont…..my fone is filled with vids of these often dramatic events…usually brief. This event didnt turn out to be brief,lol. When im out here, I have my laptop for music and for occupying myself with the web. And also for weather. First place I go when I get up(4am) is NWS and Wundermap, to see whats happening…and then I do this regularly, all day. So I had all my weather shit in one window…so i’m watching the storms IRL, and on the near real time radar. And a brief, relatively minor event, turned into a catastrophe….storms just sat there, dumping rain by the tankerfull…all over from here to kerrville. (turns out I got the most rain from this event…24” on my place, since thursday afternoon…more than kerr cnty..but I dont live on a river, nor have canyons). So I watched it rain…hard. Threw a tarp over the laptop and retreated(quite drunk and high, mind you) to the spots that generally stay dry. And it just kept on raining, superhard. Im from houston, and ive spent a lot of time in a vw van all over the gulf coast, and ive never seen a monsoon, before, save in films. Thats what this was like…bangladesh. So im out here, 5 sheets to the wind(by now, im sipping tequila…because why the hell not?) watching this incredible monsoon hammer down and I remember thinking, “ well, this aint what they predicted”. So I watched and watched…and soon, I heard a sound that I know well…rushing water…like over a rapids at a river. But way out here. It was the road and my almost always dry gully…which is not connected(for 40 years) to any current drainage system in this watershed. I had a pond…but filled with rushing water, calf-high…and so did the road,,,,and it stayed that way for…well…well into the next day(saturday), and I couldnt get to the highway until sunday. Im 20+ miles from the Llano river, maybe 12 from the San Saba. We do flood, due to the hills…but rarely anything like this. But we dont have canyons…and we have more silt…often deep, between the hills, instead of the limestone caliche that they have down there(about 50 miles as crow flies from me, to my southwest) Its now monday evening, july 7th…and it only stopped raining about 4 hours ago. Ive had some breaks…such to pick squash and zukes and a whole lotta green beans to can…and ive been to the highway, to look at the dirt road…torn up, but passable once the water ran off. That was saturday midday, I think,lol. Maybe sunday///it all runs together. \ive had intervals where I could go out and do farmer things…but then it rains again. I was out in the worst of it…thursday night, all day friday….half of that time drunk as a skunk,,,with a headlight, crocs and naked(why get yer clothes wet?) and checking on the critters….and just surveying what was going on. I am currently alone on this place…mom’s been at galveston for a week now, with my brother and his brood. This is NOT how I wanted to spend my vacation from her,lol. I’ve got a leaky house…due to being bad at roofing,lol…so my house is wet and moldy. Take a week of fans and dry weather to even begin. But I aint in kerrville, or comfort, or any of a thousand little wide spots in the road(and real cities, too) who have had it much, much worse than I. I feel for those folks…and recognise immediately many of the places in all the vids out there. I have lived out here in the texas hill country for 30 and a half years, now. I know this place, this area, this region. In that time, ive seen catastrophic floods…more often than not, along the guadalupe. But ive never seen anything as catastrophic as this. Pray, or send $, or sacrifice a chicken or whatever. A hurricane came to the middle of texas. So glad to hear from you and that beyond some very annoying property damage, you came through OK! We missed your comments. It reminded me of childhood when a tooth came out and before the adult tooth erupted you keep noticing the gap. The mouth is functional but incomplete….. that’s probably a stupid analogy but just woke up. Here in middle England we are supposedly about to enter phase 2 of our summer record breaking heatwave. This time round my dad has been a total star and I have portable A/C unit now fully set up with appropriate window covering for exhaust fan set up. Hardly very environmentally friendly but after attending a meetup group of locals and seeing where the mood of this country is taking us, I don’t feel very inclined to do my bit anymore for the next generation. UK entering FAFO phase. glad you are for the most part ok Was hoping you and your’n were ok… and glad to hear it’s so… Glad you survived, what a storm! What a tale to tell… Glad everything is jake~ Glad to hear that you made it though the storm OK. Lots of people were asking after you the past coupla days and were worried about you. Guess that you have a boat load of repairs and work to do now that the storm has abated. You wonder if this will be the last such storm that you will see or if there will be more such storms down the track. #Amen Does the silt retain water that soaks through it? Could this event lead to local groundwater recharge? If so, that could be a future benefit from all this rain right where you are at. It could hold you over somewhat through the long drought to come sooner or later. Has any thought been given ( should any thought be given) to deepening the pond so it can store more water between the occasional super-rains? yes. the deep silt(sandy loam, its called) directly recharges the hickory sand aquifer beneath me. this is why i modified the levies and such in both pastures to divert floods into them, where it can soak in(also feed the deep subsoil, that sits just above a layer of black/gray clay, around 6 foot down.(i dug cores by hand long ago…yes i am a glutton for punishment, as well as a nut for such info) the native prairie grasses(and things like wilman love i planted long ago to stabilise the then sand) have deep, deep roots that…along with the tree roots…poke through that clay strata and allow water to percolate down. down around Kerrville, Fredricksburg, Comfort, etc(all along the Balcones Fault), they have caliche…a limestone and clay sort of dirt…that becomes concrete when theres a drought….that was the situation on july 3rd. that sort of formation is called Karst…and recharge occurs through caves and fractures created over long term by the rain being just acidic enough to eat through the limestone bedrock. so totally different than here. my area is older,as far as the long ago Llano Uplift is concerned….the Karst we have remaining is up on the hill tops, and has to a great extent worn away, leaving the old granite plutons…like Katemcy Rocks, or Enchanted Rock. Theres one of those under every limestone hill you find in the entire Llano Uplift. and the limestone on our hills is old and brittle…unsuited for building, etc. here, between the hills, are deep valleys, filled with silt/sandy loam…on my place, the granite bedrock is around 100-120′ deep. thats where our wells tap in. my neighbor, not 400 yards thataway, has granite not 20′ deep, and has to do rainwater. i ended up with just over 23″, as of this time yesterday. and a large part of that water that flowed on my place, stayed here(pastures are still covered in 4″ of water), and went down. this is why swales and contour plowing are such a big deal, allows the rain to hang around and soak in, leaving yer topsoil in place, rather than carrying it off to the Gulf. biggest impact for me is my house…due to my poor roofing skills,lol. ive been running fans and hauling out the remains of the mess the boys left me when they ran off into their lives, fixin to remove furniture(free and old), etc…and just GI the whole house, so i can spread pinesol on the whole floors, and finally paint them, sometime in august. mold is what im racing against. 1200 sq ft house, so a big job…and i already had too much work and not enough body. thank y’all for askin after me. So glad you’re OK Amfortas… and also glad you’re so handy and will be able to recover. Take good care. Glad you’re OK. Stay safe!

Title: Nvidia Stock Gets Price Target Bump From Citi on 'Sovereign AI' Demand Surge

Nvidia (NVDA) is poised to take advantage of growing demand for sovereign artificial intelligence, Citi analysts wrote Monday, as governments and other organizations invest heavily in AI. The bank raised its price target for Nvidia stock to $190 from $180, lifting it further above the Visible Alpha analyst consensus of $174. Citi expects the AI data center market to reach $563 billion in 2028, up from a prior estimate of $500 billion, based on higher-than-expected sovereign AI demand. That benefits Nvidia, which is “involved in essentially every sovereign deal,” Citi said. Sovereign AI refers to artificial intelligence capabilities developed for a single entity, often a national government, run on systems under that entity's control. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month announced multiple sovereign AI partnerships during a European tour that included stops in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The semiconductor titan also recently partnered with Humain, an AI subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Bank of America analysts have said they expect “every major country” to invest in sovereign AI, “generating high-tech employment, and serving critical healthcare, defense, industrial, financial and cyber needs.” Oppenheimer said the global sovereign AI market could be $1.5 trillion, including $120 billion in Europe. Shares of Nvidia were less than 1% lower in recent trading Monday. They ended last week at a record high.

Title: Lara Croft is popping up everywhere except in a new Tomb Raider game

World of Tanks collaboration announced. Fans eager to hear more about the next Tomb Raider game are still being kept rather in the dark, with Lara Croft popping up in a number of other game collaborations instead of her own standalone adventure. Since Shadow of the Tomb Raider wrapped back in 2018, Lara has appeared in the likes of Netflix's animated series, as well as Brawlhalla, Call of Duty, Dead by Daylight, Magic the Gathering, Fall Guys, Pinball FX, and now even World of Tanks as a part of a themed Battle Pass chapter. She's again being voiced by Keeley Hawes here, in my opinion the best Lara. The new trailer for World of Tanks, which you can see below, does give Tomb Raider fans like myself another look at Lara's unified design. As a reminder, the Tomb Raider team has said it will be uniting the original Tomb Raider games with the recent 'Survivor' trilogy reboots - which began in 2013 - in its next mainline game. Lara's look in World of Tanks reflects this unification. Her style in the latest Tomb Raider collaboration takes most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her tank top and braid taking pride of place, but she also has her jade necklace from the last three mainline games. As well as Lara, Jonah from the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is featured, as is - somewhat to my surprise - Amanda Evert. Amanda first cropped up in Tomb Raider Legend as a former friend turned antagonist of Lara's. Her look in World of Tanks is perhaps most different from her original design, with the goth aesthetic toned down quite significantly. Personally, I have questions about why she is there at all, given her timeline is the Legend Timeline, which is the second game timeline in the Tomb Raider series. But this question aside, as a fan of Tomb Raider games rather than Tomb Raider collaborations, I really do wish we were being fed more than just Lara Croft in other franchises. I understand the need to keep the character relevant, but at this rate Lara is at risk of being featured more in games that aren't Tomb Raider than games that are. Truth be told, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the comparative silence around the next mainline Tomb Raider game. In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Then, in August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well". Since then, however, developer Crystal Dynamics has been subject to layoffs, and nothing more has been officially said of the next Tomb Raider entry for some time. Earlier this year, Embracer alluded to a AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this particular game will likely release the following fiscal year. While Embracer did not specify which game under its umbrella it was talking about, I suspect it was Tomb Raider. I really hope the Tomb Raider series can continue on successfully without the need to pimp Lara out to other franchises every couple of months. But right now, I am not too sure.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The OpenAI logo appears on a smartphone screen and the Microsoft logo on a laptop screen as the ... More background in Athens, Greece, on July 4, 2025. Microsoft cuts up to 9,000 more jobs as it invests in AI. (Photo by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Microsoft’s stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) has already achieved remarkable gains, increasing over 2x from $235 in early 2023 to about $500 now. What factors could drive the stock to double from its current value over the next few years? The answer is found in Azure and AI – the main growth engine for Microsoft. The company’s AI strategy is yielding tangible results, with notable uptake of its AI-driven features across its product offerings. This momentum, especially in its cloud computing sector, positions Microsoft for significant future expansion as businesses progressively adopt AI solutions in their operations. On another note, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than a single stock, you might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, garnering >91% returns since its inception. Additionally, check out – SOUN Stock To $20? Microsoft is making a significant investment in its AI infrastructure, with capital expenditures expected to rise from approximately $44 billion in 2024 to over $80 billion in 2025. This considerable investment is largely driven by the growing demands of artificial intelligence. Azure is the primary beneficiary of this investment in AI infrastructure, experiencing over 30% growth that is anticipated to persist in the near future. However, Microsoft’s integration of AI extends well beyond Azure. Hundreds of thousands of customers are already utilizing Microsoft 365 Copilot to transform their daily workflows. This represents a major transition for Microsoft, shifting from the sale of traditional software licenses to providing AI-driven productivity improvements, which command premium pricing and encourage deeper customer dependence. For instance, more than 230,000 organizations—including 90% of the Fortune 500—have already embraced Copilot Studio to create AI agents, indicating Microsoft’s successful shift from pilot projects to widespread enterprise implementation. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment serves as the company’s foremost revenue driver, producing roughly $105 billion in 2024 with impressive 20% growth. This segment is Microsoft’s fastest-growing and highest-margin area, benefiting from its unique status as both a cloud infrastructure provider and a leader in enterprise software. The incorporation of AI capabilities into Azure services further increases its value, while strong enterprise relationships ensure customer loyalty and opportunities for upselling. While Azure’s rapid growth garners significant attention, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes segment provides an essential foundation. This segment, which includes Microsoft 365, generated $78 billion in 2024, delivering stable, recurring income. This dependable revenue source allows Microsoft to finance investments in high-growth fields such as AI and cloud services. The 82.5 million Office 365 subscriptions, an increase of 10% year-over-year, highlight the stickiness of this business. With total annual revenues exceeding $245 billion, this stable base enables Microsoft to aggressively invest in AI and cloud infrastructure while maintaining strong profitability across its varied business portfolio. For Microsoft’s stock to double, the company must maintain its impressive growth, predominantly driven by its strategic leadership in AI and cloud computing. This growth will likely be propelled by the increasing adoption of AI across its Azure platform and the robust monetization of its AI-driven software, especially Microsoft 365 Copilot. Examining the figures, we estimate Microsoft’s revenues will surpass $405 billion within the next four years, with adjusted earnings exceeding $20 per share. Currently trading around $500, MSFT stock is valued at about 14 times its trailing revenues. Although this is slightly higher than its four-year average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of over 12 times, the substantial growth in Azure and Copilot may justify a premium. If Azure sustains its remarkable 30%+ growth rate, the accelerated revenue could merit even higher valuation multiples. Additionally, AI services often yield higher margins than traditional cloud infrastructure. As AI becomes a more significant contributor to Microsoft’s revenue, operational leverage could lead to considerable profit growth. If Microsoft establishes a clear lead in enterprise AI, mirroring its historical dominance in productivity software, investors might attribute a lasting premium valuation to the stock. Even a minor increase in the P/S ratio to 18 times could push the stock beyond $1,000 within the next four years. The combination of growing revenues across all segments and improved profitability stemming from AI efficiencies could substantially enhance investor confidence in Microsoft. As the company showcases its ability to monetize significant AI investments while preserving market leadership, investors may begin to apply premium valuation multiples typically reserved for high-growth technology firms. This multiple expansion, coupled with fundamental business growth, provides a mathematical foundation for the stock to double. This outcome relies on both sustained revenue growth and a reevaluation of Microsoft’s long-term earnings potential within the AI economy. While Microsoft’s trajectory appears optimistic, a number of factors could impede the stock from doubling. The primary concern is the normalization of AI spending. Companies might become more cautious about initiating new Azure projects, implying that the current rate of AI investment may not be sustainable over the long term. Additionally, competition from Google, Amazon, and emerging competitors could also challenge Microsoft’s pricing power in the AI market and its ability to gain market share. High-interest rates could render growth stocks like Microsoft less attractive compared to fixed-income alternatives. In summary, investors considering a position in Microsoft should also account for these risks. Now, we implement a risk assessment framework while developing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, consisting of 30 stocks, has a record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

However, one Wall Street analyst remains decidedly cautious on AMD's near-term prospects, recommending a wait-and-see approach for now. To wit, Truist Securities analyst William Stein has reiterated a 'Hold' rating on AMD shares, replete with a stock price target of $111 per share, which corresponds to a downside potential of around 20 percent relative to the current share price of ~$137.70. Stein alludes to the ongoing debate on whether AMD customers are only "buying to stimulate competition and price-check NVDA," or genuinely prefer AMD's technology, to declare that he prefers the former thesis. Stein also clarified AMD's recent AWS-related controversy, where the logo of Amazon's cloud business first appeared and then mysteriously disappeared from the chipmaker's list of customers. As per Stein's discussions with AMD's management, Amazon would prefer to announce a tie-up with AMD at its own events, and not via the appearance of a mere logo within AMD literature. Critically, Stein's channel checks indicate a "significant inventory build" for AMD, which is "difficult to explain," as per the analyst's admission. Given the breadth of uncertainty surrounding AMD's AI GPU business at the moment, the Truist analyst has chosen not to express a "strong view" as to whether AMD's upcoming quarterly earnings would constitute a positive or negative catalyst. As we recently noted in a dedicated post, AMD has now officially unveiled its MI350 series GPUs, which are based on its 4th-gen Instinct architecture and will become available in the third quarter of 2025. According to AMD, these GPUs are capable of delivering a 4x increase in AI compute power and a 35x increase in inferencing capacity. The company has also launched the 7th iteration of the ROCm, an open-source platform that can be used to tweak the performance of AMD's GPUs. The chipmaker claims ROCm 7 delivers an average of 3.5x and 3x performance improvement in inference and training, respectively, over its previous iteration. AMD's Helios AI rack solution, which combines MI400 GPUs with Zen-6-based Venice CPUs and Vulcano NICs, is now expected to launch in 2026. Finally, AMD has also teased the successor to Helios, which will launch in 2027 and leverage MI500 GPUs, Verano CPUs, and Vulcano NICs. The launch of MI350 GPUs in Q3 is expected to boost AMD's top-line metric for the second half of the year, with Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, C.J. Muse, now expecting AMD to earn around $6 billion in AI revenues in H2 2025. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Dow futures fall as President Donald Trump’s tariff deadline approaches, raising fresh concerns on Wall Street. With the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ending July 9, Trump officials warn duties could return to their harsh “Liberation Day” levels by August 1 unless new trade deals are signed. The market reaction was swift—Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 futures slipped, while oil, gold, and Treasury yields also dipped. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled the White House will push forward with tariffs up to 70% if talks stall.

Title: 5 Berkshire Hathaway Dividend Stocks Paying Reliable Income

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five Berkshire Hathaway dividend stocks represent a compelling mix of reliable income ... More generators spanning multiple sectors and investment themes. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long been regarded as a treasure trove of high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. The Oracle of Omaha's investment philosophy centers on identifying companies with durable competitive advantages, strong management teams, and the ability to generate consistent cash flows over the long term. These characteristics naturally lend themselves to reliable dividend payments, making Berkshire's holdings an excellent starting point for income-focused investors. In this analysis, we'll examine five standout dividend stocks from Berkshire Hathaway's current portfolio that offer compelling income opportunities. Selection methodology focused on companies with sustainable dividend yields, strong financial fundamentals and proven track records of returning capital to shareholders. I evaluated each holding based on dividend sustainability, business quality and overall investment merit in order to identify the most attractive income-generating opportunities within Buffett's carefully curated portfolio. Chevron Corporation stands as one of the most reliable dividend payers in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, offering investors a compelling 4.78% dividend yield backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in the energy sector. As an integrated oil and gas company, Chevron operates across the entire energy value chain, from exploration and production to refining and marketing. This diversification provides multiple revenue streams and helps stabilize cash flows even during volatile commodity price cycles. The company's recent performance reflects the strength of its operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation strategy. Trading at around $143 per share as of June 30, 2025, Chevron has demonstrated remarkable resilience in navigating the complex energy landscape. The company's forward dividend of $6.84 per share represents a substantial commitment to returning capital to shareholders, supported by robust free cash flow generation from its high-quality asset base. Chevron's position as a top dividend pick stems from its conservative financial management and focus on maintaining dividend payments through various market cycles. The company has consistently prioritized shareholder returns while investing in lower-carbon energy solutions and maintaining operational efficiency. With its strong credit profile and diversified operations spanning multiple geographic regions, Chevron offers income investors both attractive current yield and the potential for dividend growth as energy markets evolve. Warren Buffett's significant investment in Chevron reflects his confidence in the company's long-term prospects and management team's ability to generate sustainable returns. The energy giant's commitment to maintaining its dividend even during challenging periods makes it an attractive option for investors seeking reliable income from the energy sector. Apple represents one of Berkshire Hathaway's most significant holdings and showcases how even technology companies can become reliable dividend payers when they achieve sufficient scale and maturity. While the company's 0.51% dividend yield may appear modest compared to traditional income stocks, Apple's dividend story is compelling when viewed through the lens of total shareholder returns and the company's massive capital return program. Trading at around $200 per share, Apple has a forward dividend of $1 per share, which may seem small in absolute terms. Still, it's backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in corporate America and unprecedented cash generation capabilities. Apple's services business, in particular, provides recurring revenue streams that support dividend sustainability. The company's dividend policy reflects a balanced approach to capital allocation, combining regular dividend payments with substantial share repurchase programs. This strategy has proven highly effective in returning capital to shareholders while maintaining the financial flexibility needed for continued innovation and strategic investments. Apple's dividend has grown consistently since its reinstatement in 2012, demonstrating management's commitment to rewarding long-term shareholders. What makes Apple particularly attractive as a dividend stock within Berkshire's portfolio is the company's ability to generate enormous free cash flows from its integrated hardware, software, and services ecosystem. The recurring nature of services revenue, combined with the loyalty of Apple's customer base, provides a stable foundation for future dividend growth. Warren Buffett's substantial investment in Apple reflects his recognition of the company's transformation from a pure technology play into a mature, cash-generating enterprise capable of supporting reliable dividend payments. The Coca-Cola Company represents the quintessential Berkshire Hathaway dividend stock, embodying Warren Buffett's investment philosophy of owning businesses with enduring competitive advantages and predictable cash flows. With a dividend yield of 2.88% and trading around $70 per share, Coca-Cola continues to demonstrate why it has been one of Buffett's longest-held and most successful investments, spanning over three decades in the Berkshire portfolio. As the world's largest beverage company, Coca-Cola operates one of the most recognizable and valuable brand portfolios in the consumer goods industry. The company's global reach extends to virtually every country, providing geographic diversification and multiple growth opportunities across developed and emerging markets. Coca-Cola's forward dividend of $2 per share represents a substantial commitment to shareholders, supported by the company's consistent cash flow generation and strong market positions. The beverage giant has increased its dividend for 62 consecutive years, earning it recognition as a Dividend King and making it one of the most reliable dividend payers in the consumer staples sector. This remarkable track record demonstrates management's unwavering commitment to returning capital to shareholders through various economic cycles. The company's dividend sustainability is rooted in its asset-light business model, substantial brand equity, and extensive global distribution network. Coca-Cola's focus on higher-margin concentrate sales, combined with strategic partnerships with bottling companies worldwide, generates predictable cash flows that support consistent dividend payments. Warren Buffett's long-term investment in Coca-Cola reflects his appreciation for businesses with pricing power, brand strength, and the ability to compound shareholder wealth over decades through reliable dividend growth. American Express Company stands out as a unique financial services provider within Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, offering investors exposure to both the payments industry and premium consumer spending trends. With a dividend yield of 1.03% and trading at $319 per share, American Express has delivered a solid performance, reflecting the strength of its business model and the successful execution of its growth strategy. The company operates as both a payment network and a card issuer, creating a closed-loop system that generates revenue from multiple sources, including discount fees, interest income, and annual fees. This integrated model enables American Express to exert greater control over the customer experience and generate various revenue streams that support the sustainability of its dividend. The company's focus on affluent customers and premium card products has proven remarkably resilient, as these segments tend to maintain spending levels even during economic uncertainties. American Express's forward dividend of $3.28 per share demonstrates the company's commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining the financial flexibility needed for continued growth investments. The company has consistently increased its dividend over the years, reflecting strong credit performance, disciplined risk management, and successful expansion into new markets and customer segments. The financial services giant's ability to generate substantial returns on equity supports its dividend policy and provides confidence in the sustainability of future payments. Warren Buffett's long-term investment in American Express dates back several decades, reflecting his appreciation for the company's strong brand, loyal customer base, and ability to generate attractive returns on invested capital. The company's focus on premium customers, combined with its integrated business model and global expansion opportunities, positions it well for continued dividend growth. American Express's strong capital position and conservative approach to credit risk management make it an attractive dividend stock for investors seeking exposure to the financial services sector. Citigroup rounds out our list of top Berkshire Hathaway dividend stocks, offering investors a 2.63% dividend yield and representing Warren Buffett's confidence in the banking sector's long-term prospects. Trading at around $85 per share, Citigroup has been undergoing a comprehensive transformation under its current management, focusing on simplifying its business model and enhancing operational efficiency. As one of the largest global banks, Citigroup operates across multiple business lines, including consumer banking, institutional clients, and global markets. The bank's international presence provides geographic diversification and exposure to the growth of emerging markets, while its institutional banking franchise serves multinational corporations and financial institutions worldwide. This diversified business model helps stabilize earnings and supports dividend sustainability through various economic cycles. Citigroup's forward dividend of $2.24 per share reflects management's commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels to meet regulatory requirements and support business growth. The bank has been working to improve its operational efficiency and risk management capabilities, which should support more consistent earnings and dividend payments over time. Recent regulatory improvements and strategic focus on core businesses position the bank for enhanced profitability and shareholder returns. The bank's dividend policy strikes a balance between maintaining strong capital ratios and meeting shareholder return expectations, reflecting the regulatory environment in which large banks operate. Citigroup's substantial book value and improving operational metrics provide a foundation for dividend sustainability, while its global franchise and diversified revenue streams offer potential for future dividend growth. Warren Buffett's investment in Citigroup demonstrates his confidence in the banking sector's ability to generate attractive returns and support reliable dividend payments for long-term investors. Bottom Line These five Berkshire Hathaway dividend stocks represent a compelling mix of reliable income generators spanning multiple sectors and investment themes. From Chevron's energy sector leadership and attractive 4.78% yield to Apple's technology-driven cash generation capabilities, each stock offers unique advantages for income-focused investors. Coca-Cola's 62-year dividend growth streak exemplifies the type of consistent wealth-building opportunities that Warren Buffett seeks. Meanwhile, American Express and Citigroup offer exposure to financial services through their respective dividend yields of 1.03% and 2.63%. Together, these holdings demonstrate how Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio construction philosophy naturally leads to high-quality dividend-paying investments that can form the foundation of a robust income strategy.

Title: The stock market's biggest bet is setting investors up for a smackdown

Wall Street really needs AI to live up to the hype. A lot has been said about the emerging technology's world-changing potential: Its ability to create stunningly realistic images and videos, ace the LSAT and the MCAT, and complete rote research tasks. You could argue it's ready to augment — or even replace — entry-level jobs. These features have investors up and down the Street very excited. Staunch supporters like Fundstrat's Tom Lee and Wedbush's Dan Ives say AI could revolutionize the human experience. Research desks from big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have given subtler nods to the prospect of AI as a productivity and profit booster, which could provide an undercurrent to stock market success over the next several years. In fact, analysts are counting on the AI mania to fuel the market even as the White House's chaotic trade policy eats into corporate America's profit potential. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are projected to grow 8% this year, a fairly average showing for an anything-but-average year. What is notable is just how much of that growth relies on the tech sector: Silicon Valley companies are expected to boost their earnings by 21% — the highest growth of any sector. By contrast, profits for retailers are forecast to grow a measly 2.5%. Within the tech sector, semiconductor companies — one of the most globally exposed industries on the stock market — are expected to supercharge profit this year, with a projected climb of 49%. This enthusiasm is a signal Wall Street is betting that demand for AI's use cases will supersede tariff turmoil or job market wobbles. AI's growth has been incredible, and its adoption has been strong enough to leave its fingerprints on economic data sets like business investment and manufacturing spending. Yet no matter how rabid the world is about AI's possibilities, the amount that investors are relying on the tech to fuel the market's gains — especially in the face of rising economic uncertainty — feels short-sighted. Tech stocks helped the market recover from its April malaise, yet earnings expectations and economic momentum are even weaker than they were at the lowest point of the sell-off. This combination leaves the stock market in a precarious spot: Either AI needs to live up to the hype, or investors could be looking at a gnarly second half of the year. One way to tell the story of human history is through our technology — the lightbulb, the calculator, the tractor, the computer all stand as markers to our societal progress and have helped drive the level of efficiency and productivity we enjoy. Tech has perhaps played an equally prominent role in our investment portfolios. The Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia — are collectively worth $18 trillion, or about 33% of the S&P 500's total market value. Together, their stock prices have increased 330% over the past five years, compared with a 100% rise in the S&P 500. It makes sense. Big Tech's products have become deeply integrated into our daily lives, and that level of ubiquity has also captured Wall Street's attention. Venture capital fundraising reached a record in the first quarter amid a huge appetite for AI investment, and S&P 500 companies mentioned AI more than tariffs on second-quarter conference calls. The $65 trillion US stock market may be particularly gripped by Big Tech's ups and downs these days, but it hasn't always been this way. Tech has averaged about 20% of the S&P 500's market value over the past decade, including 13% in the five years before COVID. The dominance is not set in stone, and while the wider market's fortunes are tied to tech now, that may not always be the case. While the stock market may seem like one big proxy for the tech sector's explosive growth right now, there is one deeper connection that should draw investors' attention. Over time, the S&P 500 has been attached at the hip to the fate of the broader US economy. Eight of the past 12 market crashes — S&P drops of 20% or more — overlapped with recessions. No matter how high-flying an industry is, recessions tend to pull stock prices and business hopes back to Earth. The internet revolutionized the world in the late 1990s, and the explosion in social media dominated the 2010s, but the information sector has shed employees and seen share prices fall in the past three recessions. Given that setup, we've set the stage for a portfolio smackdown of the ages. Economists are worried a recession is coming, yet investors are surprisingly upbeat about AI's prospects — so upbeat that they've bid S&P 500 tech stocks to nearly a record high. Sell-side analysts who evaluate company-level trends are similarly optimistic. But in the real economy, layoffs are growing, and hiring has ground to a halt. The sharply diverging views between economists and stock analysts mean someone has to be wrong. The freight train that is AI adoption — a three-year story of rapid innovation and progress — could collide with a massive wall from historic tariffs, high interest rates, and low consumer confidence. What's particularly rich about this is that tech companies are the most exposed sector to global tariffs. They gather the highest percentage of revenue internationally, plus they have the most suppliers and factories outside US borders. In fact, semiconductor companies — the firms providing chips for AI technology — are expected to hit that aforementioned 49% earnings growth despite generating 67% of their revenue abroad and sourcing 70% of their supplies from overseas. Some analysts believe that if AI hopes can keep the stock market chugging along, maybe it can do the same to the economy. After all, companies invested an inflation-adjusted $2.2 trillion on computers and other processing equipment last quarter, about one-seventh of the $16 trillion Americans spent on goods and services. Investing more in AI does ultimately help boost the economy, but that $2 trillion is peanuts compared with the real engine of the US economy. Americans' spending accounts for about 70% of GDP — by far the biggest driver of output — and spending has dropped in each of the past nine recessions. If tariffs intimidate consumers and lead to layoffs that decimate American incomes, then the economy is probably bound for a crisis — whether the robots pan out or not. And based on history, an economic crisis could topple the stock market. The math shows us that AI isn't much of a match for some effects of tariffs and may not logistically be enough to save the economy from ruin. Your portfolio's outcome may be a different story, though. This is when I have to introduce you to one of the most frustrating adages of investing: The stock market is not the economy. The economy is the value that we create — the hard assets, the cash spent, the paychecks we get. Stocks are an expression of that value, but they use the present reality to project future expectations. AI's impact on the economy may not bear out through numbers. But in your portfolio, AI's influence depends on how willing we are to collectively dream up better days ahead in terms of what AI is capable of and how much money AI-dominant firms will amass in the years to come. Dreaming is already a big part of the AI trade. S&P 500 tech companies' estimated earnings grew about 50% in 2023 and 2024, yet their share prices jumped 112%. Nothing is cut-and-dried when it comes to the stock market. It is the ultimate tangled web of logic, psychology, and mixed incentives. The stock market's future depends on investors' ability to dream, and people are willing to dream when they feel confident in the present moment. The problem is, investors are awfully confident about tech stocks right now. S&P 500 tech companies made up about 23% of total index profits in the first quarter, yet their shares account for 32% of the S&P 500's value. To close that gap, tech profits would have to grow 40%, or tech stocks would have to drop 29% from their end-of-June levels. Stocks can thrive when expectations are higher than reality, but in these conditions, they require reasons to stay hopeful. The problem arises when investors aren't willing to dream. When they're too focused on present issues to give compelling stories the benefit of the doubt. Or in big market drops, crushed by financial strain. Then, the numbers matter. People claw for any concrete evidence of AI's value. They demand proof of profits, even though companies are spending money on a pivot to the next big thing. Stock prices adjust, and if you hold a swath of US stocks or index funds, your money is probably heavily exposed to this reality check. This is what happened in 2000. Investors were willing to dream about this brave new technology called the World Wide Web until interest rates climbed too high and the reality of how much computing was needed for Y2K was found to be way overblown. Suddenly, the dream died, and tech stock prices came back down to reality. These days, we all know that dream wasn't completely off base. Yet share prices took an 80% crash before the promise of the new tech came to fruition. This is what I worry about the most in the clash between AI and the economy. We're somewhere between AI saving the world and being an overhyped bust of a technology that can be ripped off by another country. I'm not foolish enough to call this a bubble, and I think AI will eventually deliver benefits for our economy. We're not there yet, though, even though investors like to think so. It takes years for big technological trends to take hold, and productivity usually shines through when workers feel empowered and companies feel comfortable expanding. That's far from the case right now — business confidence is in the dumps, so we're in the opposite scenario. When the economy is getting weaker, it's best to grasp onto what's real in your portfolio. And there's a striking gap between AI and reality.

Title: Kiwi crime-fighting software firm Auror gets big tick from UK Govt, medtech Formus Labs nears commercial launch in the US - Tech Insider

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is urging more retailers to adopt Auror's crime reporting and intel-sharing platform. Image / Getty Creative The Labour Government in the UK has a Kiwi software firm at the heart of its retail crime crackdown. Auckland medtech startup Formus Labs is about to crack the US market open - and be big in Japan. A conference hears that medtech is becoming a multibillion-dollar earner for NZ. One of our fastest-growing software firms just got a major profile boost in the United Kingdom, where it’s positioned to play a role in retail crime crackdown. Over the weekend, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper - whose portfolios includes policing - said shoplifters are to be barred from stores and prosecuted under plans for the first national database of repeat offenders. And it looks like a crime-reporting software platform made by Auckland-based Auror will play a key role in keeping the new database up-to-date. Cooper said she wanted more UK retailers to use Auror’s software, which aims to make it easier for retailers to report offences to police, including photos, and snippets of video taken on their cameras. The Home Secretary is urging police to make greater use of facial recognition technology and is behind the bill, currently winding its way through the UK Parliament. The controversial bill makes it an offence to conceal your identity from CCTV under certain circumstances (including protests), introduces the new offence of assaulting a retail worker and makes theft from a shop trial-able, regardless of the value of the goods (from a £200 [$450] threshold today). Stores including M&S, Morrisons, Boots, Tesco, Primark, and Greggs are submitting CCTV, photos and personal data on all their repeat shoplifters to Auror’s platform, which is shared with police. Cooper endorsed the Kiwi software after receiving a briefing from Boots, according to the UK’s Telegraph. Additionally, two Auror executives were recently invited to 10 Downing Street: UK and Europe vice president Mark Gleeson (a former tactical commander with the Royal Air Force) and UK director of law enforcement and partnerships Paul Fagg (who began his career as a police constable for London’s Metro Police and rose to become a police inspector with the National Business Crime Centre before joining Auror last year). Fagg said his firm’s crime intelligence platform enabled retailers to record everything that happens in their stores to tackle the “huge under-reporting issue”. “Police have access to Auror so that incidents they did not see before are now visible for them,” he said, adding that this enabled police and retailers to identify prolific offenders with CCTV and photographic evidence. The shared data enables all the stores and police to “join the dots” to identify prolific offenders, gather evidence for prosecutions and provide security staff on the shop doors with photo watchlists to bar entry, Fagg said. Auror says its system is used by 98% of retailers in NZ and 75% in Australia. In November last year, the Kiwi firm raised $82m at a $500m valuation, with the funds earmarked, in part, for a push to further expand in the US. The raise was led by two new investors: Axon Enterprise (formerly Taser International) and W23, a venture fund backed by five retailers including Tesco and Woolworths. Nasdaq-listed Axon – which has a US$70 billion ($115b) market cap – invented the Taser in the 1970s. In the 2000s it expanded into bodycams, then computer-aided dispatch software and a cloud-based digital evidence platform. The firm was already an Auror technology partner. On June 4, Axon and Auror announced a new Retail Crime Hub, which they billed as “unlocking a more efficient way for North American law enforcement agencies to collaborate with retailers and stop crime in our communities”. Auror already had a substantial beachhead in the US through anchor customer Walmart, founder Phil Thomson said. The new Retail Crime Hub should help it extend its reach. Thomson said a key issue was that while NZ has a single law enforcement authority (the police) dealing with retail crime, in the US it varied not just by state but by locality with some 18,000 agencies at the country level. Auror is pitched as a conduit to link them together for intel on retail crimes that fly well under the radar of national enforcement agencies. The fast-growing Auror has drawn a degree of privacy flak on both sides of the Tasman with a system that uses digital images which can misidentify people. But the firm has kept its nose clean with our Privacy Commissioner. Thomson emphasises that Auror doesn’t operate any security cameras and does not offer live facial recognition. Privacy Commissioner Michael Webster recently gave facial recognition trials by our two major supermarket chains his cautious tick of approval. And Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says the option of having a centralised system of facial recognition is something he expects officials to consider. “We [Auror] acknowledge the calls from groups like Retail NZ, the UK Home Secretary, and NZ Government, for the use of technology such as facial recognition technology [FRT] in the retail sector,” Thomson told Tech Insider earlier today. “We support the responsible use of FRT by retailers to protect workers, shoppers and communities from violence and harm.” Thomson knows the legal and philosophical ins-and-outs (he’s a former intellectual property lawyer with Simpson Grierson and an ex-board member of the public-interest focused NZ Council of Legal Education). But he says his support for FRT is based on what’s happening every day in the real world. “With retail violence continuing to rise, it’s a no-brainer for retailers to explore how this technology [FRT] can be responsibly used in their stores. It’s already used in everyday environments such as airports, hotels and casinos,” he says. “Due to the increase in violence and crime in stores, in my view, it’s now not a matter of ‘if’ or ‘when’ - it’s about ‘how’ this can be deployed in the best way possible, protecting communities while also protecting privacy. “Retail crime isn’t victimless - it’s violence, it’s assault, and it’s organised. We know one in 10 events involve violence or use of a weapon. Ten % of top repeat offenders are responsible for more than 60% of the crime in Kiwi stores. Furthermore, repeat offenders are up to four times more likely to be violent.” Auckland-based med-tech Formus Labs will commercially launch in the key US market in a couple of months, founder and chief executive Dr Ju Zhang says. The launch follows the start-up gaining US Food and Drug Administration approval in December for its AI-powered, 3D software for planning orthopaedic surgeries - specifically hip replacements, with its FDA green light. Formus is lining up deals with the likes of hospital chains and insurance firms. Zhang says his firm has pilots already under way with several “tier one” and “tier two” players - with revenue above US$1 billion ($1.65b) or in the hundreds of millions, respectively. The start-up already has a close relationship with one of the biggest names in the field - Indiana-based Zimmer Biomet, with whom it’s partnered with in Australia since 2019. Zhang says with major commercial revenue just months away, there are no plans for another sizeable raise, though it’s possible Formus will stage a small round for bridging. (Its last major raise was US$5m ($8.25m) in early in a round led by Global From Day 1 and supported by Icehouse Ventures, Pacific Channel, Flying Kiwis and Punakaiki Fund). The FDA approval was a breakthrough moment as many regulators around the world take their lead from the US agency, Zhang says. Japan - a major market for orthopaedic technology - will be next cab-off-the-rank for the multi-Hi-Tech Awards winner. Australia is also a major market. Zhang says Formus consults closely with several orthopaedic surgeons in NZ but commercial maths means the primary focus has been across the Tasman and in North America. Regardless, he and his crew of 16 staff are based in Auckland, which he anticipated will remain the hub of the firm’s R&D. There’s a lot that’s high-tech about joint replacement surgery these days. But there’s also a lot of drilling, scraping, sawing and hammering. “In some ways, it’s a lot like carpentry,” Zhang says. Formus Lab’s software helps a surgeon more quickly and accurately prepare, and pick the right size joint replacement from what can run into hundreds of options. Currently one in 10 operations have to be redone and one in five have some degree of post-op complication. At a HealthTech Week event in Auckland last week, the audience heard that New Zealand’s MedTech sector currently generates around $2.6b in annual revenue and is projected to reach $3.8b by 2028, a compound annual growth rate of 7.8% since 2018, according to Technology Investment Network, TIN200 stats. “It’s still dominated by the big fish; the likes of F&P Healthcare,” Callaghan Innovation HealthTech head Andrew Clews told Tech Insider. “But there is a second tier of companies coming through now that we’re supporting.” Clews says venture capital money is coming on board and the number of start-ups is increasing - thanks in part to a tight-knit ecosystem. Formus Labs is one of several medtechs spun out of Auckland University’s Bioengineering Institute, for example, he said. Others include Kitea Health, the maker of a world-first wireless implant for measuring brain pressure, Toku Eyes and Alimetry. The event was arranged by Te Tītoki Mataora, funded by Auckland University and MBIE and Callaghan Innovation’s HealthTech Activator. Both programmes offer various forms of support for medtech start-ups, although Callaghan Innovation is being disestablished. With most staff already laid off, the HealthTech Activator has funding to last through until a new advanced research agency is created around this time next year.

Title: Microsoft Washes Its Hands Of Ad Tech; Google’s Network To Get Work

Call It ‘Don’t Invest’ Microsoft is undergoing its second round of massive layoffs in as many months, Bloomberg reports. The details on the latest round are still unknown, but Microsoft Advertising was keenly affected by layoffs in May, which fell hardest on legacy product and engineering roles. But regardless of how the latest layoffs play out, Microsoft is clearly deprioritizing – if not wholesale abandoning – much of its third-party ad tech: i.e., former AppNexus products, a publisher ad server and PromoteIQ, its retail media acquisition. Microsoft is also calling it quits on Invest, the one-time AppNexus DSP, which is shutting down in early 2026. PromoteIQ went the way of the dodo last year. Having had a taste of third-party programmatic tech, Microsoft appears to be spitting most of it back out after extracting the bits it still finds valuable. Yet Microsoft Advertising says it remains “committed to our end-to-end platforms that help our clients reach the audiences they need wherever they are across the open web,” a spokesperson told AdExchanger in 2023 for a story about a reorg related to the former AppNexus. “Nothing has changed here,” they added. (Okay.) After those statements were made, it would be just another 18 months before Microsoft’s DSP was given its notice of pending termination. Google’s Pub Crawl Google wants to get back into the good graces of publishers, which isn’t easy, considering Google’s AI searches are siphoning their traffic. Oh, and not to mention a landmark antitrust case regarding Google’s sell-side ad tech. But Google is now growing its sell-side ad tech enterprise sales teams, The Information reports. Google Ad Manager’s (GAM) clientele indexes to smaller businesses that are typically less willing to pay ad premiums, which means publishers get relatively lower rates via GAM. One publisher saw “a lower percentage of revenue coming from Google’s advertising technology tools than they did three years ago,” according to The Information. Google’s ad network, which encompasses GAM and accounts for money paid out to publishers, has been declining for years, even as Google’s overall revenue has skyrocketed. Meanwhile, two weeks ago, Google announced a new paywall product called Offerwall that gives readers a variety of options to access articles, such as paying a one-time fee or watching an ad. Perhaps Google is shining its sell-side business in advance of a potential forced divestiture, speculates The Information. Or Google could genuinely see a need to shore up its sell-side ad tech due to market share gains by vendors like PubMatic, Magnite and Amazon. Regardless, Google has a steep mountain to climb if it wants to regain its standing with publishers. Meta-Friendship Meta has been quietly developing chatbots that proactively engage with users, Business Insider reports. The goal, per documentation from Alignerr, the AI chatbot vendor working with Meta on the project, is to “provide value for users and ultimately help to improve re-engagement and user retention.” For creators, the chatbots could respond to comments and fans on their behalf. For brands, it’s an organic way to retarget people. And users might turn to specialized chatbots for recipe ideas, say, or music recommendations. Meta already laid out its vision of a future where AI chatbots populate its platform indistinguishably from real people. Mark Zuckerberg frames this work as a potential fix for the “loneliness epidemic” afflicting Meta users and people in general. It hasn’t been smooth sailing, though. Earlier this year, Meta had to frantically delete its first AI chatbot friends, which came off as painfully cringe to actual humans.

Title: After a Year of High-stakes Financing, Saks Turns Back to High-stakes Retailing
URL: http://wwd.com/business-news/financial/saks-luxury-retail-reset-challenges-1237963658/
Time Published: 2025-07-07T04:01:00Z

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The luxury department store has access to the funds it needs to operate now; the question is how well it will square up to a tough retail market. Deputy Managing Editor The year since Saks and Neiman Marcus Group cut their landmark $2.7 billion deal has been dominated not by talk of a new luxury retail giant or a modern merchant force taking shape. Instead, it’s been all about the rough and tumble of high-stakes corporate finance. On that score, it’s been a story of quick and agile dealmaking that would be surprising or just unbelievable from almost anyone else but Richard Baker, executive chairman of what is now Saks Global. Related Articles Financial S&P Cuts Saks Global's Credit Rating to CC Fashion Features From Sex Clubs to Castles, Latex to Upcycling, Berlin Fashion Week Had Something for Everyone Consider this: You May Also Like And then things really got started. Hudson’s Bay was spun off and went bankrupt, Saks and Neiman’s vendors were thrown into a tailspin by a yearlong schedule to repay past due bills and 90-day payment terms on all shipments going forward. And bondholders — some of whom seem to haven’t bothered to read some very important fine print — revolted when they learned their debt wasn’t directly secured by the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship. Saks then lined up $350 million in new financing in May only to ditch that in favor of $600 million in financing last month from a group of bondholders jockeying for a better position in the capital structure. From the outside, the company has appeared to be lurching from one crisis to the next. And from the inside, it’s seemingly been a nightmare. But last week, new money in hand, Saks made a crucial $120 million interest payment on the bonds. It’s said to be paying vendors on time under the new terms and Marc Metrick, chief executive officer, has even floated the possibility of making back payments earlier than planned. “As we progress over the next few months, if we see a return to what we believe to be normalized receipt flow, we plan to evaluate the possibility of accelerating the timeline to pay back past due balances to our brand partners,” Metrick told vendors in a memo last month that was obtained by WWD. At least for now, the Saks story is no longer a tale about financing. Everyone inside and out agrees that Saks has the money to get through this year and sources close to the company maintain that it has the financial wherewithal to last much longer even if Christmas doesn’t turn out to be a blockbuster season. One source said Saks’ outside auditors gave the company a clean bill of health — good for at least a year — after the $350 million in financing was lined up and now that’s been upsized to a potential total of $600 million, giving it even more cushion. Right now, the future of Saks is not about its ability to wrangle investors or lenders, but the company’s retail savvy and its ability to push what Metrick has called a “reset” of luxury retail through an increasingly complicated retail market. “All we heard about is ‘We’re running out of money,'” said Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, summing up the bondholder take on the company. “’We need money for inventory, we need money to make interest payments.’ Money, money, money. So OK, we got you set up, you told us you needed this much money, now you show us that you know what to buy and you bought the right inventory and you know how to sell it to make a reasonable profit.” That’s the trick in retail anyway — and one that requires finesse in good times and real skill in tough ones, like now when consumers are skittish and President Donald Trump’s trade war is still disrupting supply. Big retail mergers are dicey to start with. “Now, they have control of the best high-end retailers,” Hynes said. “In theory it should work out. Nobody’s going to open a new high-end retailer tomorrow. It’s just not going to happen. So they got the market cornered. In theory, if anything’s going to work, this should work. Everybody says, ‘Rich people always have money, this should work out.’ However, if you look at history, combining retailers has never worked out.” That point could be argued, kind of — the Federated-May mega merger worked for a time and changed the retail landscape, but that company, now Macy’s Inc., is now morphing again for a new age. But nobody argues that Saks is working in a tough space. “Department stores are not the best neighborhood to be operating in,” said Mickey Chadha, the Moody’s Investors Service debt analyst who follows Saks. “They’re relying on cost cuts, layoffs, efficiencies between the two companies,” Chadha said. “And that’s all great. If you can accomplish that, you’re definitely better for your bottom line. However, you have to grow, you have to grow. And their sales have been declining quite dramatically in the last couple of years. So if you don’t grow, there’s only so much you can do in synergies and cost cuts. “This $600 million of new monies that we’re talking about is great,” he said. “It gives them more runway to get the ship back on course. But it’s not going to be the end all. If they continue to burn cash, that $600 million will then disappear again in the next 12 months, and then they’ll need more capital. The holiday is going to be key for them.” Holiday, next year and beyond relies not on raising more money or courting investors, but on making the big Saks reset work. It’s a complicated bit of work for Metrick. Saks Global is combining operations for the two nameplates, reestablishing trust with vendors, cementing the new payment terms, expanding through a luxury shop on Amazon and looking at brands in new ways with its Authentic Luxury Group joint venture. Somewhere in there could be a bright future for the idea of the luxury department store, which has suffered blow after blow since the bankruptcy of Barneys New York in 2019. There is no shortage of brands with real gripes against Saks as it just now starts paying bills due years ago. But some luxury labels are also sensing new potential ahead — and brands both large and small say Saks Global is vital to their businesses and its survival is key. One adviser to independent designer brands said they are getting more excited about Saks’ shop on Amazon, which launched with 50 brands and is said to be bringing new shoppers into the business. “Are we going to actually see more sales through e-commerce than we’re seeing in the physical stores?” the adviser wondered. “How does the retail footprint shrink or change?” That refocuses the narrative around Saks back to where it really should be — its retail fortunes.

Title: The Broken Microsoft Pact: Layoffs and Performance Management
URL: https://danielsada.tech/blog/microsoft-pact/
Time Published: 2025-07-06T22:54:21Z
Full Content:
When you join Microsoft, you hear stories about people who’ve been there for 20 years, who grew up with the company, who never had to worry about sudden changes (maybe except for 2008). The performance management system had its quirks, but there was an understanding that if you did solid work, you’d have a place. But something shifted. Maybe it was the market, maybe it was the pressure to stay competitive with companies that move faster and pay more. The implicit agreement that made lower compensation feel acceptable started to crack. For decades, Microsoft operated under an unspoken agreement with its employees—what I call “the pact.” The deal was simple: We’ll pay you 20-50% below market rate, but in exchange, you get stability, reasonable work-life balance, and most importantly, no layoffs. This wasn’t written in any employee handbook, but everyone understood it. It was the Microsoft way. For many strong performing engineers, this was an attractive trade-off. You might not get rich as quickly as your friends at startups, but you could plan your life around stability. You could get a mortgage, start a family, and sleep well knowing your job wasn’t going anywhere. According to layoffs.fyi, Microsoft has laid off around 30,000 people in the last two years. To put this in context: that’s roughly 13% of Microsoft’s workforce, and while the entire tech industry saw significant layoffs (Meta, Google, Amazon all made major cuts), Microsoft’s situation stands out because of their historical commitment to employment stability. Many people are confused about this departure from Microsoft’s traditional approach. As a former employee, I want to share my perspective on why this shift was almost expected. While economic factors certainly contributed, Microsoft’s performance management challenges made layoffs a more attractive option than addressing individual performance issues systematically. Microsoft’s performance management has always been atrocious on both sides of the ruthlessness/leniency scale. In the Ballmer era, the forced stack ranking of employees. Essentially a system where managers had to grade their teams on a curve, with a predetermined percentage forced into “underperforming” categories regardless of actual performance, caused people to live in this fear environment. Even if you had a team of stellar performers, someone had to be labeled as bottom 10%. This led to internal competition, backstabbing, and people gaming the system by avoiding high-performing teams or sabotaging colleagues. This caused great attrition and unfavorable business outcomes for Microsoft. The system was so universally hated that when Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014, eliminating stack ranking was one of his first major moves. The opposite became true: it seems managers had to fight HR to get someone on their team out. I personally saw the bad side of this. I had a co-worker who had no productive outcomes for a year, and it took a year of continued documentation to get him fired. This also caused a downstream effect on team morale, as he was still getting rewards and a salary similar to other people. Sadly, one of the tradeoffs you have to understand is that at the same level, over the same year, the difference in pay between someone at the highest level of performance versus someone who passably does their job does not create enough differentiation for most levels lower than principal, barring random exceptional one-off stock grants (which also don’t help retention, due to their randomness). This causes the system to not be a meritocracy, with “passing by” being the default. I’ll acknowledge upfront that Microsoft is a massive, diverse company with thousands of managers and teams. My experiences reflect specific orgs, specific timeframes (2016-2022), and specific leadership chains. Your mileage may vary dramatically depending on your team, your manager, and your timing. I recognize that some teams and managers at Microsoft do provide strong performance differentiation, meaningful career growth, and excellent employee experiences. However, these patterns were consistent enough across my tenure, conversations with colleagues from different orgs, and observations of broader company trends that I believe they represent systemic issues rather than isolated incidents. The goal isn’t to dismiss positive experiences but to highlight structural challenges that affect enough employees to warrant discussion. For me, coming from outside the US where employment contracts offer significantly more protection, at-will employment was a jarring concept. In most countries, terminating an employee requires cause, documentation, and often significant severance payments. Employment contracts typically specify notice periods — sometimes months — giving both parties time to plan transitions. At-will employment means your employer can terminate you for any reason (or no reason) at any time, as long as it’s not discriminatory. No advance notice required. No severance guaranteed. One day you’re planning your next sprint, the next day you’re cleaning out your desk. This reality requires a completely different approach to financial and mental planning. You can’t just budget for your monthly expenses, you need to maintain an emergency fund that can cover 6+ months of unemployment. You can’t get too comfortable or assume job security based on performance alone. You need to constantly network, keep your resume updated, and maintain relationships outside your current company. Here’s where at-will employment creates a perverse incentive structure that helps explain Microsoft’s recent layoff approach. While you can fire someone for any reason, firing individual employees for performance still carries significant legal risk and administrative burden. To fire someone for performance, managers must document everything meticulously. Every missed deadline, every subpar deliverable, every coaching conversation needs to be recorded. HR requires a paper trail that can withstand legal scrutiny. This process can take months or even years, during which the underperforming employee continues to collect their salary and potentially drag down team morale. The legal risk is real. Even in at-will states, wrongful termination lawsuits can be expensive and time-consuming. Companies worry about discrimination claims, especially if the fired employee belongs to a protected class. Better to have an ironclad documentation trail than face a costly legal battle. Layoffs, paradoxically, are “cleaner.” When you eliminate entire roles or teams, you sidestep the performance documentation requirements. You’re not firing someone for being bad at their job, you’re eliminating the job itself. The legal risk is minimal, and you can even look compassionate by offering severance packages and transition support. Employees can even claim unemployment and keep their income for months! For VPs and executives, layoffs solve multiple problems at once: they can eliminate underperformers without the messy documentation process, reduce headcount to hit financial targets, and maintain the narrative that they’re making “tough but strategic decisions” rather than admitting they failed to manage performance effectively. The bitter irony? Getting laid off is often better for the employee than being fired. Layoffs typically come with severance, extended healthcare, and the ability to say you were “affected by restructuring” rather than “terminated for cause.” You get more time to find your next job, and your professional reputation remains intact. This creates a system where companies find it easier to fire good employees in bulk than to fire bad employees individually. The legal protections meant to prevent arbitrary termination end up enabling exactly that, just at scale. For visa workers, the math is even more stark. When fired for performance, H-1B and other visa holders typically have just 60 days to find new employment or leave the country. But when laid off, they get severance time plus the 60-day grace period, often giving them 3-6 months to secure new sponsorship. For someone whose legal status depends on employment, layoffs are significantly more humane than performance-based termination. The AI efficiency narrative provides the perfect cover for these layoffs. Companies can frame headcount reduction as “leveraging AI to increase productivity” or “optimizing for the future of work.” It sounds forward-thinking and strategic rather than admitting they failed to manage performance or simply want to cut costs. Whether AI actually replaces the laid-off workers’ productivity is rarely measured or proven, but the narrative sells well to investors and the media. The pact is fundamentally broken. Instead, a new pact has been formed: Rather than prescribing what people should do, I think it’s worth understanding the game theory at play. If exceptional performance only nets a negliglible level of improvement while layoff risk remains constant, rational actors might consider: Focus energy strategically. When reward differentiation is minimal, investing extra energy in building external networks and transferable skills may provide better long-term returns than purely internal recognition. Maintain financial cushions. Regardless of performance level, keep emergency funds for unexpected transitions. Keep options open. Whether this means networking, skill development, or periodic market checks depends on your personal risk tolerance and career goals. The optimal approach depends on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and what you value in a career. The Microsoft I joined no longer exists today.. The implicit contract that made lower compensation tolerable — stability and job security — has been broken. What remains is a company that pays below market rate while offering the same job insecurity as anywhere else. For current and prospective Microsoft employees, understanding this new reality is crucial. The company still offers excellent benefits, interesting technical challenges, and the prestige of working at a tech giant. But the days of trading pay for security are over. Would I return to Microsoft knowing what I know now? Maybe. But it would be with a completely different mindset than my first time around. I’d go in understanding that it’s a traditional job with traditional job insecurity, not the stable career haven I once believed it to be. I’d negotiate harder on compensation, knowing there’s no stability premium to justify below-market pay. And I’d never again make the mistake of believing that good performance alone guarantees job security. The Microsoft of today can still be a great place to work, if you go in with realistic expectations and plan accordingly. I want to be clear about something: I’m not bitter about my time at Microsoft. I learned enormously, worked on products used by millions, built lasting relationships, and gained experience that directly contributed to my current success. Microsoft gave me opportunities I’m genuinely grateful for, and I have tremendous respect and admiration for many of the people I worked with there. This analysis isn’t about personal grievances. It’s about a structural shift that affects how people should think about employment decisions. The same way you’d analyze any investment or major life choice, understanding the changing risk/reward profile at Microsoft (or any company) is just rational decision-making. Many people thrive at Microsoft today and will continue to do so. The goal isn’t to discourage anyone from working there, but to help people make informed decisions based on the current reality rather than outdated assumptions about job security.

Title: Analyst Unveils Crypto Catalysts for ‘Jubilant July,’ Says Altcoins Will Likely ‘Cook’ for Next Few Weeks

A crypto strategist with a history of timely Bitcoin (BTC) calls believes that the digital asset market will flourish this month. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 868,800 followers on the social media platform X that he sees the crypto markets rallying this month amid a slew of bullish catalysts. “It’s the start of a new quarter and a new month. It’s also Jubilant July. I gotta say. I feel extremely refreshed for the first time in a long time with all the positives happening. Stablecoin legislation is moving forward. More rails are being connected with traditional finance, banks and consumers. Crypto will continue to grow as a focus in global markets. Let’s also not forget the fiscal and monetary tailwinds that are coming.” As for the fiscal tailwinds, the analyst says that the US is positioning to ease monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, while Bitcoin and US equities are in a strong uptrend. “If you’re bearish, consider this. The market has, for now, failed to prove a bullish bias to be incorrect. When there is FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), it V reverses into new highs each time. No matter how extreme the FUD. Market structure is intact on high time frames. BTC and stocks are at or around all-time highs. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing outgrowing its debt by spending more. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing lowering interest rates, which in this instance would likely stoke both inflation/growth. If the market proves these ideas to be incorrect, then you can pivot. I see no reason to be bearish on markets with this in mind.” Turning to altcoins, Pentoshi says he’s keeping a close eye on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of crypto, excluding the 10 largest digital assets and stablecoins. The analyst predicts that OTHERS will soar close to $400 billion, indicating massive upside potential for altcoins. “I do think many alts will likely cook for the next few weeks. Just feels like… sellers have run out of momentum. Many of them look better than they have in quite some time. I think you could essentially use last week’s lows as a point we shouldn’t lose on most of these… I think we see others play out something like drawn below.” At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $229 billion.

It’s likely to be the latter more often. But the opposite is true, as well: We also believe that the best place to hire from is the competition. Just recently, Meta’s new division — with an eye on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) — announced 11 key hires from arch rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. If reports are to be believed, Mark Zuckerberg has been personally leading the hiring campaign by hosting some of the potential hires at his home. This prompted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to claim that Meta offered $100 million signing bonuses to some of his employees. And Meta isn’t alone. The move echoes industry-wide trends. This year alone, Microsoft spent $650 million acquiring much of Inflection AI’s team while Amazon hired the co-founders of Adept, a start-up developing AI-powered agents. Begs the question whether anti-compete contracts aren’t at play? In a recent case of a software engineer vs his former employer, the Delhi High Court ruled that the non-compete clauses blocking job switches are not enforceable. The court said that Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, clearly says that any agreement that restrains anyone from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business shall be void. A research handbook published by the leading global law firm DLA Piper offers insights into anti-compete laws worldwide. Interestingly, among the 34 major countries they studied, only in five, including India, are the non-compete employment contracts non-enforceable. But, just in case you have forgotten the fine print of your employment contract and want to browse it again, you will find an anti-compete clause glaring at you. Did the MNCs bring their global template to India and were we only too happy to copy and paste it from entry-level jobs to senior leaders, making no distinction between the dictates of the roles and the laws of the land? Cognizant’s hiring of Wipro’s former CFO sparked a legal battle, which eventually got settled after nine months. The current legal proceedings between Cognizant and Infosys, involving allegations of anti-competitive practices in the US healthcare IT market, show that the stakes are high for these enterprises. When firms lose leaders who hold key customer relationships or techies who have the IP to build new-age products or platforms at the competition, the threat is real. This may prompt organisations to protect their interests, which explains the suits. In spite of these potential legal exposures, why do boards still hire CEOs from the competition? The mindset of large enterprises with deep pockets is to ‘buy’ talent, rather than ‘build’ it, since this takes time, and the risks of a potential anti-compete suit are outweighed by the benefits of the hiring. The popular ask from hiring managers is “We want to recruit someone who hits the road running”. When Zomato wanted to boost its live events business, it didn’t promote someone internally— it hired the live events head from BookMyShow and designated him as Founder. Ditto Starbucks — within 17 months of hiring a new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, it replaced him with a leader from Chipotle, and immediately its stock price went up by 20 per cent and has remained steady since. Even the stock market cheers when you hire from the competition. The hypocritical mindset of enterprise culture is hard to miss. We hire our top talent from rivals but internally we berate them on a regular basis to build the competitive spirit in our teams. Whenever we chest-thump about our products, services or employers, we can’t help but reference them against our competitors, and hence it’s emotionally hard to accept anyone amongst us joining a rival. Hence, we resort to practices like ‘garden leave’, immediate relieving, legal threats, and/or holding on to financial dues as a mark of retaliation. All these also send a ‘message’ to colleagues of the consequences of joining the competition. These over-the-top reactions breed a different set of behaviours among team members, who eventually start lying about their health and personal matters when they leave or join friendly employers briefly and eventually join competitors a couple of months later. I agree it’s an uphill task to eliminate the anti-compete clauses we have included in all roles within our enterprises. But can we take a leaf out of Belgium, where non-competition clauses are valid only if the employee earns an annual gross remuneration of at least €78,706? Day in and day out, our leaders talk about the strength of our brands, the legacy of the company, loyal customers, enviable culture, best financial rewards and, not to forget, the Best Employer certificates that we keep flashing. However, our employment contracts don’t reflect the same spirit that we find on our office posters. Are enterprises built with such weak foundations that one leadership movement to the competition can bring them down? What’s the fear? When sports clubs and premier leagues allow players to be bought and compete against the club where they were trained at, why not enterprises?

Title: New UN report reveals the companies getting rich off Israeli occupation and genocide
URL: https://mondoweiss.net/2025/07/new-un-report-reveals-the-companies-getting-rich-off-israeli-occupation-and-genocide/
Time Published: 2025-07-06T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese, issued a seminal report on June 30, titled “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide.” It focuses on the economic interests benefiting from the current genocide in Gaza. While the report itself names a lot of names, from states to corporations, banks, and universities, Albanese concludes, “the entities named in the present report constitute a fraction of a much deeper structure of corporate involvement, profiteering from and enabling violations and crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory.” The report comes on the heels of two other major reports by Albanese last year: the “Anatomy of a Genocide” from March 2024 and the “Genocide as Colonial Erasure” in October 2024. In the latter, Albanese identified how Israel was expanding its genocide from Gaza to the West Bank. Her analysis holds that there are three main elements of Israel’s colonialist takeover: displacement, replacement, and erasure. Genocide is the most extreme form of erasure, but it is a part of the larger eliminationist logic within a broader plan of “colonial erasure.” Given her mandate on territories occupied since 1967, that is where Albanese focuses her analysis. The Israeli occupation since 1967 has had broad economic support, particularly from the corporate world, and these actors have mostly continued that support as Israel has moved to its next stage of colonial erasure: Genocide. The focus of this report is to show how corporations have enabled the displacement, replacement, and erasure of Palestinian life, exposing “the integration of the economies of settler-colonial occupation and genocide.” The report finishes with a stirring call to action. In Albanese’s words, “Commercial endeavours enabling and profiting from the obliteration of innocent people’s lives must cease. Corporate entities must refuse to be complicit in human rights violations and international crimes or be held to account.” A post shared by Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur oPt (@francesca.albanese.unsr.opt) The economic actors facilitating displacement are mostly companies that are involved with heavy equipment, weapons, and tech surveillance. There is a myriad of actors, directly or through subsidiaries. For example, Caterpillar is a well-known example with its deep collaboration with Israeli weapons manufacturers and military: “For decades, Caterpillar Inc. has provided Israel with equipment used to demolish Palestinian homes and infrastructure, through both the United States Foreign Military Financing programme and an exclusive licensee requisitioned by Israeli law into the military. In partnership with companies such as Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Leonardo DRS, Inc.-owned RADA Electronic Industries, Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the military, deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines, “neutralizing” the territory and killing Palestinians.” This has placed Caterpillar at the center of genocide in Gaza: “Since October 2023, Caterpillar equipment has been documented as being used to carry out mass demolitions – including of homes, mosques and life-sustaining infrastructure – raid hospitals and burying alive wounded Palestinians. In 2025, Caterpillar secured a further multi-million dollar contract with Israel.” But there are many other examples in this industry as well: “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been linked to the destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through exclusively licensed Israeli dealers. Volvo’s licensee is an OHCHR database-listed company [UN database lists business enterprises that have “directly and indirectly enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the settlements”] and together they own Merkavim Transportation Technologies Ltd., which produces armoured buses sold to service colonies. Since at least 2007, Volvo machinery has been used to raze Palestinian areas, including in East Jerusalem and Masafer Yatta. For over a decade, HD Hyundai machinery has been used to demolish Palestinian homes and raze farmland, including olive groves.” And these become tools of genocide: “After October 2023, Israel increased the use of the equipment of those companies in the urban destruction of Gaza, including in flattening Rafah and Jabalia, after which the military obscured their logos.” Military tech surveillance is a big part of the Israeli colonialist displacement regime. Israeli companies such as the NSO Group have built a global market for their surveillance technology, but the report also names several well-known international corporations and outlines their roles in supporting Palestinian displacement. These include IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Palantir. Once Israel displaces Palestinians, a wide array of businesses support the consolidation of its control through the creation and maintenance of Israeli colonies: construction, raw materials (often pillaged from occupied territory), agribusiness, tourism, etc. Here, there are also many international actors that facilitate the normalization of Israel’s displacement and theft: “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the occupied Palestinian territory. In 2024, this intensified after the administration of colonies moved from the military to the civilian Government and the Ministry of Construction and Housing budget doubled, with $200 million allotted for colony construction. From November 2023 to October 2024, Israel established 57 new colonies and outposts, with Israeli and international companies supplying machinery, raw materials and logistical support”. While the same heavy machinery providers reappear (Caterpillar, HD Hyundai, Volvo), other actors provide raw materials: “The German Heidelberg Materials AG, through its subsidiary Hanson Israel, has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank. In 2018, Hanson Israel won a public tender to supply materials from that quarry for colony construction, and has since nearly exhausted the quarry, prompting ongoing expansion requests.” Transport: “Various companies contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians. The Spanish/Basque Construcciones Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles joined a consortium with a OHCHR database-listed company to maintain and expand the Jerusalem Light Rail Red Line and build the new Green Line, at a time when other companies had withdrawn owing to international pressure. These lines include 27 kilometres of new tracks and 50 new stations in the West Bank, connecting colonies with West Jerusalem. Doosan and Volvo excavators and machinery have been used, and Heidelberg’s subsidiary supplied materials for a light-rail bridge.” Real estate: “Real estate companies sell properties in colonies to Israeli and international buyers. The global real estate group, Keller Williams Realty LLC, through its Israeli franchisee KW Israel, has had branches based in the colonies. In March 2024, Keller Williams, through another franchisee, Home in Israel, ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.” And then there is “occupation tourism”, which brings in the online services, Booking.com and Airbnb: “Major online travel platforms, used by millions to reserve accommodation, profit from the occupation by selling tourism that sustains the colonies, excludes Palestinians, promotes settler narratives and legitimizes annexation. Booking Holdings Inc. and Airbnb, Inc. list properties and hotel rooms in Israeli colonies. Booking.com has more than doubled its listings in the West Bank – from 26 in 2018 to 70 by May 2023 – and tripled its East Jerusalem listings to 39 in the year post October 2023. Airbnb has also amplified its colonial profiteering, growing from 139 listings in 2016 to 350 in 2025, collecting up to 23 per cent commission. These listings are linked with restricting Palestinian access to land and endangering nearby villages. In Tekoa, Airbnb enables settler promotion of a “warm and loving community”, whitewashing settler violence against the neighbouring Palestinian village of Tuqu‘.” There is an entire interconnected network of companies, institutions, and interests that weave together to support and profit from the Israeli occupation. The entities are all enabling Israel’s illegality, and Albanese breaks them down by sector. War crimes and crimes against humanity are a risky business in general. Investing in a country that creates so much turmoil is counterintuitive for many, and many investors have bailed out of the high-tech industry, for example. That’s why financial giants are important to secure that investments in the war machine keep flowing. Albanese explains how the world’s largest banks give Israel financial cover as it carries out genocide. Albanese: “Some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms – including Blackrock ($68 million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960 million) – were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them. Meanwhile, the Development Corporation for Israel (i.e., Israel Bonds) provides a bond solicitation service for the Government of Israel for overseas private individuals and other investors. The Development Corporation for Israel tripled its annual bond sales to funnel nearly $5 billion to Israel since October 2023, while offering investors the option of sending the return on bond investments to charitable organizations supporting the Israeli military and the colonies.” Insurance companies then buttress this: “Global insurance companies, including [German] Allianz and AXA, also invest large sums in shares and bonds implicated in the occupation and genocide, partly as capital reserves for policyholder claims and regulatory requirements, but primarily to generate returns. Allianz holds at least $7.3 billion and AXA, despite some divestment decisions, still invests at least $4.09 billion in tracked companies named in the present report. Their insurance policies also underwrite the risks other companies necessarily take when operating in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, thus enabling the commission of human rights abuses and “de-risking” the operational environment.” And pension funds are involved in this too, including Norwegian and Canadian ones: “Sovereign wealth and pension funds are also significant financiers. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, claims it has the world’s most comprehensive ethical guidelines. After October 2023, the Fund increased its investment in Israeli companies by 32 per cent to $1.9 billion. By the end of 2024, the Fund had $121.5 billion – 6.9 per cent of its total value – invested in companies named in the present report alone. The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which manages Can$ 473.3 billion ($328.9 billion) in pension funds for six million Canadians, has almost Can$ 9.6 billion ($6.67 billion) invested in companies named in the present report, despite its sustainable investment policy and human rights policy. From 2023 to 2024, it almost tripled investment in Lockheed Martin, quadrupled investment in Caterpillar and increased 10-fold the investment in HD Hyundai.” But the enablers are not just financial institutions. Albanese shows how academia has also played a crucial role. The most prestigious academic institutions are tied to Israel. Like MIT: “Leading universities, especially from global-minority countries, partner with Israeli institutions in areas directly harming Palestinians. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, labs conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense – the only foreign military financing research at the Institute. Notable Israeli Ministry of Defense projects include drone swarm control – a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023 – pursuit algorithms and underwater surveillance. From 2019 to 2024, the Institute managed a Lockheed Martin seed fund connecting students to teams in Israel. From 2017 to 2025, Elbit Systems paid for membership to the Institute’s Industrial Liaison Program, enabling access to research and talent.” Huge EU academic projects are involved: “The European Commission’s Horizon Europe programme actively facilitates collaboration with Israeli institutions, including those complicit in apartheid and genocide. Since 2014, the European Commission has granted over €2.12 billion ($2.4 billion) to Israeli entities, including the Ministry of Defense, while European academic institutions both benefit from and reinforce this entanglement. The Technical University of Munich receives €198.5 million ($218 million) in EC Horizon funding, including €11.47 million ($12.6 million) for 22 collaborations with Israeli partners, military and tech firms. The University and Israel Aerospace Industries receive €792,795.75 ($868,416) to jointly develop, with other participants, green hydrogen refuelling, technology relevant to Israel Aerospace Industries military drones used in Gaza. The University partners with IBM Israel – which runs the discriminatory Israeli Population Registry – on cloud and artificial intelligence systems, as part of the €7.75 million ($8.52 million) IBM Israel receives in Horizon funding. The University also collaborates on a €10.76 million ($11.71 million) project on “seamless shared urban mobility” that includes the Municipality of Jerusalem, a city entrenching annexation through urban transportation.” Agribusiness has often been seen as a trademark of Israel’s innovation, but it is inextricably connected to Israel’s occupation. “Agribusiness has thrived on Israel-led extractivism and land-grabbing – producing goods and technologies serving Israeli settler-colonial interests, expanding market dominance and attracting global investment – while erasing Palestinian food systems and accelerating displacement,” Albanese writes. She names the Israeli food giant Tnuva, and the watering giant Netafim: “Tnuva, the largest food conglomerate in Israel, now majority-owned by the Chinese Bright Food (Group) Co., Ltd., has fueled and benefited from land dispossession. Tnuva’s Chairman recognized that “agriculture … in general and dairy farming in particular are a strategic resource and a significant pillar in the settlement enterprise”. Israel has used kibbutzim and agricultural outposts to seize Palestinian land and replace Palestinians. Companies like Tnuva help by sourcing products from these colonies, then exploit the resulting captive Palestinian market to build market dominance… Netafim, a global leader in drip irrigation technology, now 80 per cent owned by the Mexican company Orbia Advance Corporation, has designed its agritech in concert with the expansion imperatives of Israel. While maintaining a global image of sustainability, Netafim technology has enabled intensive exploitation of water and land in the West Bank, further depleting Palestinian natural resources, while being refined through collaboration with Israeli military-technology firms. In the Jordan Valley, Netafim-aided irrigation systems have facilitated Israeli crop expansion, while Palestinian farmers – denied water and with 93 per cent unirrigated land – are pushed out, unable to compete with Israeli production. Furthermore, such irrigation techniques threaten to exhaust the Jordan River and Dead Sea.” Shipping giants like the Danish Mærsk then ship the goods: “Global logistics giants like A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S are integral to this ecosystem; for years they have shipped goods from the colonies and OHCHR database-listed companies straight to the United States and other markets.” And Mærsk is involved in much more than just shipping avocados: “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post October 2023.” Those who supply Israel with energy, inevitably supply what Israel is doing – not just its colonization, but also its genocide. A lot of world actors are involved here: “Coal for electricity to Israel originates primarily from Colombia (60 per cent of Israeli coal imports in 2023-24); United States-headquartered Drummond Company, Inc. and the Swiss-based Glencore PLC are the primary suppliers. Their respective subsidiaries own the mines and the three ports involved in the delivery of 15 coal shipments to Israel since October 2023, including six shipments after Colombia suspended coal exports to Israel in August 2024. Glencore was also involved in shipments from South Africa; these shipments accounted for 15 per cent of Israeli coal imports in 2023 and 2024.” This is taking place while Israel pillages Palestinian natural resources: “The United States Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMed Energy (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan. The Gaza naval blockade is connected to Israel securing the Tamar gas supply and the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline. At a time of increasing brutality, the British company BP PLC is expanding involvement in the Israeli economy, with exploration licences confirmed in March 2025, which allow BP to explore Palestinian maritime expanses illegally exploited by Israel.” While all these sectors of industry help contribute to and enable the Israeli occupation in one way or another, it cannot be forgotten that the Israeli military and weapons industry are a primary vehicle for and beneficiary of Israel’s military aggression and genocide. Albanese naturally has a section focused on the military sector, titled “Military sector – the business of elimination,” which shows how its military industry serves a major national and international economic interest. Albanese explains: “The military-industrial complex has become the economic backbone of the State. Between 2020 and 2024, Israel was the eighth-largest arms exporter worldwide. The two most prominent Israeli weapons companies – Elbit Systems, established as a public-private partnership and later privatized, and State-owned Israel Aerospace Industries – are among the top 50 arms manufacturers globally.” And there’s the cooperation with the U.S., which has culminated in the F-35 jet program, a massive international effort: “Israel benefits from the largest-ever defence procurement programme – for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United States-based Lockheed Martin, alongside at least 1,650 other companies, including Italian manufacturer Leonardo S.p.A, and eight States… Post-October 2023, F-35s and F-16s have been integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.” There are also the Elbit drones, which is also the product of international collaboration: “Suppliers such as the Japanese FANUC Corporation provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin”. And shipping, of course, so once again Mærsk: “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post October 2023.” So while there is the raw military industry, which people obviously associate with the worst of the attacks against Palestinians – but there is so much more to Israel’s apparatus of control over Palestine and Palestinians. It is so enormous and so globally interconnected that it would be hard to find a person in this world who doesn’t know at least one of the corporations involved. Albanese concludes with her recommendations for states, corporations, the ICC, and the UN. For corporations, this is to “cease all business activities and terminate relationships directly linked with, contributing to and causing human rights violations and international crimes against the Palestinian people” and to pay reparations to the Palestinian people. She offers the example of an apartheid wealth tax along the lines of post-apartheid South Africa. For states and international bodies, such as the ICC and UN, Albanese calls on them to enforce the accountability mechanisms at their disposal, not only on Israel, but on the corporations who are enabling its illegal action. In addition, she called on states to impose sanctions and a full arms embargo on Israel. And then finally, she has a call to action for us in civil society: “The Special Rapporteur urges trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens to press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and accountability at the international and domestic levels; together, the people of the world can end these unspeakable crimes.” Albanese outlines a worldwide network of collaboration that enables Israel’s genocide in one way or another. It is overwhelming to consider, and some may be daunted by its enormity, but it is not an invincible system. It operates on elements that are very mundane: resources and money. It is dependent on an economic network and on global consent. And here lies the key to dismantling it. Albanese ends: “The complicity exposed by the report is just the tip of the iceberg; ending it will not happen without holding the private sector accountable, including its executives. International law recognizes varying degrees of responsibility – each requiring scrutiny and accountability, particularly in this case, where a people’s self-determination and very existence are at stake. This is a necessary step to end the genocide and dismantle the global system that has allowed it.” Jonathan Ofir Jonathan Ofir is an Israeli musician, conductor and writer based in Denmark. You can hear it directly from Francesca Albanese in this 13 minute interview with Chris Hedges: “...the genocide in gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative…” “The Real Reason the Genocide Hasn’t Been Stopped” https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/06/the-real-reason-the-genocide-hasnt-been-stopped-w-francesca-albanese/ And there’s also another reason the genocide has been allowed to continue: the U.S. military is testing the waters to see what the public will tolerate: In the past several years, the Department of Defense has become fixated on how the United States might fight a major war against an enemy that rivals the American military in force and technology. In such a scenario—known as a large-scale combat operation, or L.S.C.O.—combat would take place across land, sea, air, and into the thermosphere. Command of the air could not be taken for granted. Intelligence may be spotty. Casualties could soar into the hundreds of thousands, and whole cities could be flattened. “In short,” Modirzadeh writes, the U.S. military has begun “preparing for an all-out war with China.” And, with such conflagrations burning in the mind, “LSCO lawyers,” as Modirzadeh calls them, have been arguing that the laws of war are far more permissive than many of their peers and the public seem to appreciate. From that vantage, Gaza not only looks like a dress rehearsal for the kind of combat U.S. soldiers may face. It is a test of the American public’s tolerance for the levels of death and destruction that such kinds of warfare entail. “What’s Legally Allowed in War…How U.S. military lawyers see Israel’s invasion of Gaza—and the public’s reaction to it—as a dress rehearsal for a potential conflict with a foreign power like China.” https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/whats-legally-allowed-in-war Re: Military tech surveillance is a big part of the Israeli colonialist displacement regime. Israeli companies such as the NSO Group have built a global market for their surveillance technology, but the report also names several well-known international corporations and outlines their roles in supporting Palestinian displacement. These include IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Palantir. Yes, its humorous that the Washington Post reported Google founder Sergey Brin company and its parent Alphabet had been cited in the UN report, but didn’t mention their publisher Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, that was cited in the same report. Brin had recently stated that the United Nations is “transparently antisemitic”. According to Jewish News UK The statement was made in the context of an internal Google forum where employees were discussing the UN report which alleged that tech firms, including Google, were profiting from Israel’s military actions in Gaza through contracts like Project Nimbus. An AI generated Washington Post survey of readers responses said they viewed Brin’s comment negatively. Netanyahu is literally an internationsl fugitive, who is wanted on charges of starving, murdering persecuting, and exterminating Palestinian refugees he placed under seige in a tiny sliver of their homeland. While that is happening in front of the world, two of his Foreign Ministry aparatchiks were attending a strategy meeting to spell out the details of Netanyahu’s plan to implement and raise mony for the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. When the Washington Post reported they had been murdered, they posted the story on social media “The killings of two Israeli Embassy staffers amplify the confusion felt since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks about where Jews belong.” It’s unsurprising when you’ve built Herzl’s Der Judenstaat according to plan for national racial segrgation, displacement of other ethnic populations, and the deliberate employment of Jewish fear, misery, and intolerance of others. The Zionists sprang into action and distracted attention from the underlying facts: “‘Where Jews belong?’ Jews belong where anyone and everyone else belongs, you vile f–ks,” commentator Joanne Mason wrote to her more than 30,000 followers on X.’ But the murdered woman was an advisor to the Hillel Board of Trustees who banned Jewish Voice for Peace members from even speaking or meeting in the premises of her Kansas University Hillel. Each of those businesses employs workers, all of whom are complicit in the Israeli genocide. They know that the results of their well-paid, comfortable careers in arms manufacture here in the UK, in the USA and in Europe are injured and dead children. It would be interesting to hear their excuses. If the weapons they made were being directed at their own children would they still go to work?

July 06, 2025 07:46 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

ByNicolas Straut ByNicolas Straut, Contributor. When constructing your investment of $1,000 you should consider what the core of your portfolio will ... More be made up of and your investment aims. You could spend your $1,000 on anything, but you made the wise decision to invest it in equities to grow your wealth. This guide will share some of the best stocks for 2025 including growth, income and volatile but high-returning opportunities. These recommendations are based on analyst ratings, sector exposure, earnings and recent momentum. As you consider this mix of equity options including the "magnificent seven” stocks, large value-oriented companies, REITs and technology stocks, you’ll see some familiar names as well as learn new ones, each with interesting theses as to why you should consider them for your portfolio. Ultimately, constructing a portfolio is research intensive and while you may not invest in each of these picks, you’ll hopefully be exposed to new industries and gain insight into the vast array of stock opportunities at your disposal. Microsoft is a tech giant and household name known for a variety of products from software with Office and Windows, to cloud computing services with Azure, to gaming with Xbox. Its latest venture in AI, through Copilot in partnership with OpenAI, is bringing AI functionality to a broader audience in hopes of better competing with Google and Apple, both of whom are expanding AI features to their customer bases. This behemoth tech stock is a pick because of both its strong balance sheet and consistent earnings, as well as its reliable dividend. Microsoft is also worthwhile to consider for your stock portfolio because of its aforementioned offering of Azure, the customer base of which is growing 14.2% year-over-year, with over 350,000 organizations utilizing it. This strong showing makes Microsoft more competitive with Amazon’s AWS, a dominant cloud services provider. Microsoft is an ideal fit for investors seeking a long-term hold stock delivering innovation-fueled growth, a strong leadership team, and security in a world adapting to AI. You’ve likely heard of NVIDIA in the context of its dominance in the world of chips, with the company holding over 80% market share for sale of data center GPUs. In particular, NVIDIA’s H100 and its now in full production Blackwell chips which power AI training and compute for the top technology firms like Google, Amazon and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s growth isn’t slowing down with revenue in Q1 up 69% from a year ago. While this firm does have a high P/E, NVIDIA backs it up with strong revenue and income rising as more firms invest in AI to capture its promise. The majority of analysts also maintain this stock as a buy or strong buy. NVIDIA is a good fit for those who want a high-growth stock with more room to grow, who don’t prioritize a dividend yield and who are bullish on the continued adoption of AI. Long associated with its founder, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway is a large firm delivering broad exposure to industries like insurance through Geico, car manufacturers like Mitsubishi, and technology like Apple. While Buffett may have recently stepped down, Berkshire is in solid leadership hands with years of experience working under Buffett’s tutelage and with his famous methodology and wisdom, passed down by both memos and direct work experience. Berkshire holds over $340 billion in cash, awaiting a market downturn or the right opportunities, giving them a secure buffer and investment capital for their next big stakes. While Berkshire offers no dividend, this stock offers high returns with over 20% returned over the last year. This stock offers diversification and a conservative value-driven investing approach to your portfolio. Visa is a credit card-processing giant which processes north of 40 billion transactions annually, earning fees from each purchase. With a moat built around its network which is global, billions of cards in use, deep integration with financial institutions and over 1 billion more cards in circulation than its primary competitor, Mastercard, Visa is well positioned to provide financial sector exposure and security to investors. Visa continues to expand, with new partnerships penetrating into emerging markets, and growth from digital payments through providers like Apple Pay. A majority of analysts consider Visa a buy or strong buy based on its financials and growth prospects. Investors who want a dominant financial sector stock which is conservative and global would be well suited to buy this stock. Palantir is a technology company which offers software systems primarily to the U.S. government but also to corporate clients with a suite of platforms delivering data integration, intelligence and analysis. Two of its primary platforms are Foundry, which is used for data centralization and analysis by healthcare companies, commercial firms and governments, as well as Gotham, which is an intelligence and data platform used for defense. With year-over-year revenue growth of 39% and a recent contract with the U.S. government of more than $100 million, Palantir is well positioned for growth from both its commercial and government platforms. Palantir is a mixed bag in analysts’ eyes with many considering it a stock to hold rather than buy. But with a moat of hard-to-acquire contracts from major firms and government actors and increasingly-advanced products fueled by AI, Palantir could be a worthwhile growth play in your portfolio. Ideal investors for this stock would be those comfortable with volatility in exchange for long-term growth who are not seeking a dividend. Realty Income is a top REIT that owns thousands of commercial properties which lease space to firms like Walgreens, FedEx and other well-known consumer-facing companies. Investors choose O for reliable, monthly dividends which have been paying out income for decades even in the midst of economic downturns. Realty Income offers around 5.6% in dividends making it a desirable option for investors seeking reliable income, like retirees, those supplementing their own income or investors seeking to round out a growth-heavy portfolio. Realty Income’s diverse clients provide some resiliency even in down markets, and this stock has performed well even as growth stocks dip in price. O could be a good addition to your portfolio if you’re seeking to balance out other equities, if you’re seeking income or would simply like real estate exposure without buying land or properties yourself. Carvana is a technology-driven firm which makes it easy for consumers to buy or finance cars online. While its business suffered and nearly went bankrupt in 2022, it grew considerably over the last two years, nearly reaching its 2021 peak of just over $360 a share. This return to life was due to its innovative car purchasing model and drastically reduced costs. Carvana is a volatile, growth-driven stock that should be considered by investors seeking short-term gains as it rises in value. Over the last year it experienced a return of over 172% without sign of slowing down. As with Strategy, which will be discussed next, consider your risk tolerance and what percentage of your portfolio you would feel comfortable risking for juiced portfolio returns. Bitcoin treasury companies are a big trend in 2025 as they bet on bitcoin’s continued growth and adoption. The principal driver of this trend is Strategy Incorporated (previously Microstrategy). Strategy holds almost 600,000 Bitcoin, each valued as of July 1, 2025 at $105,820, and continues to buy the cryptocurrency by issuing debt or equity. This stock has risen over 170% in the last year fueled by easing of regulation on crypto, clearance of bitcoin ETFs and speculation that bitcoin will continue to rise in price. Microstrategy is thought of by some as a leveraged BTC play as MSTR often grows by 2x to 3x the growth of bitcoin, but this leverage can work in the opposite direction if bitcoin crashes. MSTR is a worthwhile investment for investors who don’t mind the high risk that the stock or BTC carries, in the hopes of continued high growth. If you do consider using part of your $1,000 to purchase MSTR, understand the risk that both this stock and bitcoin carries and invest according to your risk tolerance. Bottom Line When constructing your investment of $1,000 you should consider your risk tolerance, but also what the core of your portfolio will be made up of and your investment aims. From this list, a good core stock makeup for stability, quality and reasonable growth would be Microsoft, NVIDIA, Visa and Berkshire Hathaway. Good growth stocks to add in moderation and according to risk tolerance, are Palantir and Carvana. For additional yield, Realty Income could be added to deliver monthly dividends and stability in downturns, and finally, Strategy could be added to deliver crypto exposure as well as the potential for high returns. This stock mix with your $1,000 would deliver income, growth and portfolio stability. Ultimately there are thousands of stocks available to consider for your portfolio but with research, analysis and consideration of your financial position, you can grow your net worth and achieve the future you seek.

This strong showing makes Microsoft more competitive with Amazon’s AWS, a dominant cloud services provider.

NVIDIA’s growth isn’t slowing down with revenue in Q1 up 69% from a year ago. While this firm does have a high P/E, NVIDIA backs it up with strong revenue and income rising as more firms invest in AI to capture its promise. The majority of analysts also maintain this stock as a buy or strong buy. NVIDIA is a good fit for those who want a high-growth stock with more room to grow, who don’t prioritize a dividend yield and who are bullish on the continued adoption of AI. Long associated with its founder, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway is a large firm delivering broad exposure to industries like insurance through Geico, car manufacturers like Mitsubishi, and technology like Apple. While Buffett may have recently stepped down, Berkshire is in solid leadership hands with years of experience working under Buffett’s tutelage and with his famous methodology and wisdom, passed down by both memos and direct work experience. Berkshire holds over $340 billion in cash, awaiting a market downturn or the right opportunities, giving them a secure buffer and investment capital for their next big stakes. While Berkshire offers no dividend, this stock offers high returns with over 20% returned over the last year.

With a moat built around its network which is global, billions of cards in use, deep integration with financial institutions and over 1 billion more cards in circulation than its primary competitor, Mastercard, Visa is well positioned to provide financial sector exposure and security to investors. Visa continues to expand, with new partnerships penetrating into emerging markets, and growth from digital payments through providers like Apple Pay. A majority of analysts consider Visa a buy or strong buy based on its financials and growth prospects. Investors who want a dominant financial sector stock which is conservative and global would be well suited to buy this stock.

Global developments will shape market sentiment in the coming week along with quarterly earnings. Among important events is the announcement of US-India trade deal. Along with US President Donald Trump’s move to inform trading partners about planned tariff rate. The US Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its June policy meeting, and investors will track interest rate decisions from central banks in Australia and South Korea. The June 2025 quarter earnings season begins this week, with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. set to announce its results. On the IPO front, Travel Food Services’ public issue opens for subscription, and Crizac is set to debut on the stock exchanges. Back home, Indian equities ended last week in the red amid caution around the India-US trade deal, foreign capital outflows, and the start of the earnings season. The Nifty formed a small bearish candle on the weekly chart, suggesting a phase of consolidation after recent gains. Analysts expect the index to trade with a positive bias within the 25,200–25,700 range, with stock-specific action likely to drive market direction. Benchmark indices broke a two-day losing streak to settle higher on Friday but on a weekly basis the Nifty 50 and Sensex declined over 0.75%. The NSE Nifty 50 ended 55.70 points or 0.22% higher at 25,461, while the BSE Sensex closed 193.42 points or 0.23% up at 83,432.89. This week, the broader market indices outperformed the benchmark indices, with the Nifty and Sensex experiencing declines after two consecutive weeks of gains. The Nifty Realty sector saw a significant drop of over 2%, making it the worst-performing sector of the week, with Macrotech Developers Ltd. and Brigade Developers leading the declines. Investor focus in the coming week will remain firmly on the uncertain India-US trade deal, with US President Donald Trump's July 9 deadline approaching. Despite months of negotiations, no breakthrough has been achieved, and it is expected that the deal will be announced in the coming week. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal made it clear that India will not rush into any deal based on external deadlines, insisting that any agreement must be fully concluded and in the national interest. Markets are also preparing for the start of the fr=irst quarter earnings season. IT majors Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Tata Elxsi Ltd. will report their results during the week, offering early insights into sector performance amid ongoing global demand concerns. Retail giant DMart is scheduled to announce its results on Friday. Apart from corporate earnings, India’s weekly foreign exchange reserves, will be released on Friday.

US crude oil inventories will also be released on Wednesday. Additionally, the US will release the jobless claims data for the week ending July 5. UK will release its GDP date for the May.

The headline act is Travel Food Services, a Mumbai-based operator of airport lounges and quick-service restaurants across India and Malaysia. Its Rs 2,000 crore public issue opens on July 7, with a price band of Rs 1,045–1,100 per share. The offer comprises 1.82 crore existing shares, and investors must apply for a minimum of 13 shares. On the SME front, upcoming IPOs include GLEN Industries, Chemkart India, Smarten Power Systems, CFF Fluid Control, and Asston Pharmaceuticals. These smaller offerings aim to tap into investor appetite for niche, high-growth companies in specialised sectors. The listings provide a range of options for investors seeking opportunities outside of large-cap names. Several IPOs are also set to make their stock market debut this week. Pushpa Jewellers, Silky Overseas, Vandan Foods, Cedaar Textile, and Marc Loire will list on July 7. Crizac in the only main board listing in the week and will debut on July 9, followed by Cryogenic OGS and White Force on July 10, and Meta Infotech on July 11.

Title: The Force-Feeding of AI on an Unwilling Public

Time Published: 2025-07-06T06:19:41Z
Full Content:
A few months ago, I needed to send an email. But when I opened Microsoft Outlook, something had changed. Microsoft asked me to use Copilot to write my email. Copilot is my AI companion. (That’s the cute word they use.) Hey I don’t want a companion—especially not a fake AI buddy. I never asked for this. And what about the people receiving my emails? They don’t want this either. They want to hear from me, not a bot. How do I turn my companion off? After some trial-and-error, I found a way to disable Copilot. Phew! But a few days later, Microsoft surprised me again. It wouldn’t let me save an Excel file until I had agreed to new terms for my software account. Guess what? AI is now bundled into all of my Microsoft software. Even worse, Microsoft recently raised the price of its subscriptions by $3 per month to cover the additional AI benefits. I get to use my AI companion 60 times per month as part of the deal. But I don’t want to use it. I want to kill it. As you can see, I’ve never used this service. I still have all 60 credits unused. But I’m paying for it—because it’s now embedded into Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. This is how AI gets introduced to the marketplace—by force-feeding the public. And they’re doing this for a very good reason. Most people won’t pay for AI voluntarily—just 8% according to a recent survey. So they need to bundle it with some other essential product. You never get to decide. Before proceeding let me ask a simple question: Has there ever been a major innovation that helped society, but only 8% of the public would pay for it? That’s never happened before in human history. Everybody wanted electricity in their homes. Everybody wanted a radio. Everybody wanted a phone. Everybody wanted a refrigerator. Everybody wanted a TV set. Everybody wanted the Internet. They wanted it. They paid for it. They enjoyed it. AI isn’t like that. People distrust it or even hate it—and more so with each passing month. So the purveyors must bundle it into current offerings, and force usage that way. There’s another reason why huge tech companies do this—but they don’t like to talk about it. If they bundle AI into other products and services, they can hide the losses on their income statement. That wouldn’t be possible if they charged for AI as a standalone product. That would make its profitability (or, more likely, loss) very easy to measure. Shareholders would complain. Stock prices would drop. Companies would be forced to address customer concerns. But if AI is bundled into existing businesses, Silicon Valley CEOs can pretend that AI is a moneymaker, even if the public is lukewarm or hostile. It’s like a restaurant selling granite rocks for dessert. Nobody will buy them or eat them—so the product fails miserably. But if a popular restaurant adds a dollar to the meal price, and gives every customer a rock with their bill—well, then they can say that: Every customer gets rocks for dessert. Every customer pays for it. Their business is more profitable because of the tasty granite rocks. This is how AI accounting works in Silicon Valley. And that’s why Google does something similar to Microsoft. They add AI to search results—you don’t get to choose. It’s force-feeding all over again. So these huge digital platforms can pretend that users have totally embraced the new tech. Shut up, buddy, and chew on your rock. This is how AI gets implemented everywhere. You don’t get to choose. You’re never asked. It just shows up. Now you have to deal with it. I don’t want AI customer service—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI responses to my Google searches—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI integrated into my software—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI sending me emails—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI music on Spotify—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI books on Amazon—but I don’t get a choice. If they gave people a choice, they would reject this tyranny masquerading as innovation. The AI business model would collapse overnight if they needed consumer opt-in. Just pass that law, and see how quickly the bots disappear. Customer surveys prove that. The survey cited above presented customers with descriptions of different refrigerators. When AI was added as a feature, people showed a preference for all the other models. The Wall Street Journal concludes that companies should “beware of promoting AI in products.” And it’s more than just products and services. People don’t even want AI in texts or documents of any sort. In an earlier day, customer feedback would discourage businesses from adding AI. But the dominant AI companies are huge quasi-monopolies. So they don’t ask, they don’t care—they just do it. Every day it gets more brazen. Meta is now planning to unleash bots on you in even more aggressive ways than Google or Microsoft. They are training AI bots to send you messages, whether you want them or not. And I know (from painful personal experience) that you cannot disable Facebook Messenger without shutting down your entire Facebook account. There’s a word for this. It’s called spam—and people hate it. But that’s the blight of the AI revolution. It looks like spam. It smells like spam. It tastes like spam. What happens if we decide to boycott AI? The sad truth is that we can’t. It’s already too powerful. If I wanted to boycott AI, I would need to give up My email account All Google searches My word processing software Also Excel, PowerPoint, etc. Amazon and many other online retailers Spotify and any other music streamer that allows it Contacting customer service at many companies Etc. etc. etc. That’s bad news—because most of us need some of those things to live and work. But it will soon get much worse. Just wait and see. The day will eventually come when… You want to see a doctor or nurse—but you will be forced to use the AI chatbot. You will desperately need counseling, but only AI will be available. You seek legal advice, and just get a bot. You apply for a job, but they give it to a bot instead. You need an emergency responder—police, firefighter, paramedic—but you can only reach a bot. We already know that they won’t let us choose. That’s already decided. So now the only question is how quickly they will remove the few remaining instances where humans deal with humans. Judging by the current situation, tech companies will move quickly. They don’t ask for permission. It just happens. What’s most shocking is that they have done all this before making AI reliable. Every day I hear accounts of stupid and ridiculous things coming from bots. You would think they would fix this mess before forcing AI on us. But here’s the harsh reality. They won’t fix it, because they don’t know how. Despite that, they will accelerate the force-feeding. There should be laws against this. There should be transparency laws. There should be opt-in laws. There should be liability laws. There should be IP laws. We’re lucky that AI bots don’t write the laws—at least not yet. We should take action before that happens. And if politicians won’t act, let’s turn to voter initiatives (which are binding in many places) or class-action suits or take other steps. I have a hunch that juries will be sympathetic to our plight. After all, they are getting force-fed too. Let me address a final question—which is the frequently mentioned argument that the US needs to develop AI as fast as possible to get there before the Chinese. I’m not sure where there is. But I’m happy to let China or other countries arrive at that unhappy destination while I wait behind and watch. I’m absolutely certain that getting there will be a matter of great regret. There might even be the last place you would want to be. So I’d rather it happened as far away from here as possible. Ted, you called it "spam." My term for it is far less polite. I'm off all social media. I refuse to use AI for my writing. When AI "overviews" come up on Google searches, I immediately skip past them to real sources. I opt out as much as one individual can. There are free alternatives to Microsoft Office and they don't have AI. No posts Ready for more?

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/05/2025 12:22:43 PM PDT by E. Pluribus Unum Workers are anxious that artificial intelligence could wipe out their jobs as layoffs continue and employers are cautious about hiring. Tech executives, economists and other experts say that AI could automate mundane and tedious tasks and also create new roles. Tech companies that are cutting jobs and leaning more on artificial intelligence are also disrupting themselves.Amazon’s Chief Executive Andy Jassy said last month that he expects the e-commerce giant will shrink its workforce as employees “get efficiency gains from using AI extensively.”At Salesforce, a software company that helps businesses manage customer relationships, Chief Executive Marc Benioff said last week that AI is already doing 30% to 50% of the company’s work.Other tech leaders have chimed in before. Earlier this year, Anthropic, an AI startup, flashed a big warning: AI could wipe out more than half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years.Ready or not, AI is reshaping, displacing and creating new roles as technology’s impact on the job market ripples across multiple sectors. The AI frenzy has fueled a lot of anxiety from workers who fear their jobs could be automated. Roughly half of U.S. workers are worried about how AI may be used in the workplace in the future and few think AI will lead to more job opportunities in the long run, according to a Pew Research Center report.The heightened fear comes as major tech companies, such as Microsoft, Intel, Amazon and Meta cut workers, push for more efficiency and promote their AI tools. Tech companies have rolled out AI-powered features that can generate code, analyze data, develop apps and help complete other tedious tasks.“AI isn’t just taking jobs.

Title: CEOs Say AI Is Poised to Wipe Out an Astonishing Number of Jobs
URL: https://futurism.com/ceos-ai-job-market
Time Published: 2025-07-05T15:15:05Z
Full Content:
Billionaire tech moguls aren't the only ones doomsaying about artificial intelligence layoffs. CEOs across a range of industries are now jumping on the bandwagon, saying it's no longer a matter of "if," but "how many" jobs AI will take. A recent survey by the Wall Street Journal explored just how pervasive the automation idea is throughout a number of industries, and execs aren't pulling any punches. For example, CEO of Ford Motor Company Jim Farley recently predicted that AI "is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the US." He added that "AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind." In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy spooked his employees with a memo saying to expect layoffs in the next few years because of the "once-in-a-lifetime" revolution of AI. And at JPMorgan Chase, CEO Marianne Lake recently told investors to expect the company's overall head count — and therefore its payroll expenses — to fall by as much as 10 percent over the next few years, thanks to the magic of AI. If the AI automation dystopia really is upon us, it evidently slipped under the radar of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which recently released its latest jobs report. Among other things, it found that the US added 147,000 jobs in June, slightly dropping the unemployment rate from 4.2 percent to 4.1 — and seemingly refuting the claim of an impending AI takeover, at least for now. Over half of these jobs, NBC notes, were in state and local government roles, while healthcare, social, service, and construction work made up the bulk of other gains. Still, there are some major issues buried in the data, like the fact that long-term unemployment — people unemployed for six months or more — has skyrocketed from 190,000 to a whopping 1.6 million. Meanwhile, the number of people unemployed at the median length of unemployment, 15 weeks or more, jumped from 34.9 percent to 38.3 percent. That level hasn't been seen since the throes of the pandemic, NBC notes. While those numbers are bad news — like, really bad — the crisis they point to is a little more complicated than an AI-powered dystopia. At their core, these numbers are arguably the result of our economy's dependence on unemployment laundered through AI hype. As economic researchers Jeffrey Funk and Gary Smith observed in a recent column, revenue from large language model (LLM) adoption is falling far short of the tech industry's promises. What gets presented as proof of AI's automation potential is instead a mash of penny-pinching layoffs, outsourcing, labor market saturation, and in some cases, employer bias against recent college grads. With that view in mind, all the CEO bluster looks less like an imminent crisis brought on by AI, and more like business as usual in a market economy. What workers do about that whole situation is another story altogether.

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Continued job growth and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the One Beautiful Big Bill ... More Act (OBBBA) helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline looms as the next big hurdle this week. Better-than-expected job growth and the passage of US tax legislation propelled the S&P 500 to all-time highs on Friday. Please note that the tax bill is named the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA), so no partisan political views are intended by using its name. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The resiliency of the labor market and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the OBBBA helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. Stocks & Recession Odds The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since the stocks bottomed, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. This data bolsters confidence in the view that the macroeconomic situation has been the primary driver of stocks so far this year. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks The S&P 500 reached an all-time high in the holiday-shortened week, now resting at 2.2% above its previous mid-February high after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 3.5% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. The strength in US bank stocks remains notable. The Federal Reserve recently revised its methodology, which will result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital means better profitability and the ability to return more capital to shareholders. In addition, banks are economically sensitive, so they typically receive a boost from better economic outlooks. Market Returns Employment grew by 147,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly higher, which is a positive. The household survey data was solid, with a gain of 93,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 751,000. The significant increase in the research series reverses much of the decline from the previous month. Monthly Job Growth Contrary to expectations, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. The decline was due to job gains of 93,000 in the household survey and a reduction of 130,000 in the labor force. US Unemployment Rate Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.8% last month. The average workweek hours were lower at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, hampered by weather and the LA fires. Workweek & Wages Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The improvement in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence that the labor market has been resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Bottom line: The details of the jobs report were less impressive than the headline, but job growth was better than expected, and labor market health remains solid. Markets currently expect two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. The better jobs data eliminated any chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is still expected in September. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Economic data releases are sparse this week. In addition, there are only two companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings. Now that the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA) has been signed into law, President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline should be the focus. While deals with Vietnam and the UK, as well as a détente with China, have been reached, the tariff levels of many large trading partners remain unsettled, barring a trade agreement. President Trump said letters are being sent to the countries notifying them of the effective tariff rate on their exports to the US, effective August 1, unless a trade deal is reached. Market participants will be keen to see if more trade deals are signed or if the possible economic drag from higher tariffs begins to weigh on the US economic outlook again. Stocks have reacted favorably to the better economic data and the likely boost from the tax cuts passed last week. The hurdles at these valuation levels are higher, but optimism about future corporate earnings has improved as economic downside risks have receded. Another spike in effective tariff rates around President Trump’s July 9 deadline could raise concerns about the economic headwinds increasing again, so increased volatility would not be unexpected.

Title: Tesla robotaxi incidents spark confusion and concerns in Austin

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two weeks into Tesla’s robotaxi prototype rollout on the streets of Austin, Texas, a string of viral videos showing apparent mishaps and the severely limited access to the service have caused a cloud of confusion and concern around the vehicles and their safety. Tesla launched its Austin service on June 22. People who’ve gotten an invitation, a group that appears to be composed largely of influencers adjacent to and acolytes of CEO Elon Musk, use an app to call for a ride, similar to ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft. Each ride costs $4.20, a cannabis-associated number that Musk frequently uses. The service is somewhat of a prototype. Although no human is in the driver’s seat, each car has a company employee in the front passenger seat who can stop the car with a button if there are safety concerns. Tesla says its experimental software is driving the vehicles. Experts in the field of autonomous driving say it’s too early to judge the success or failure of the venture. Federal regulators and some local and state politicians say they’re concerned about several incidents — documented on camera and shared on social media — where the cars appeared to break traffic laws or put people in danger. Some people who’ve used competing robotaxi services, such as Google spinoff Waymo, yawned at what they considered old technology. Even the stock market shrugged off the launch, with no lasting imprint on Tesla’s share price. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on how the service is going. Several key metrics, such as how many miles it has driven and how often Tesla employees need to intervene with the driving software, remain mysteries. Because the service operates only in Texas, where there are currently minimal rules surrounding autonomous vehicles, the company is not required to report such information to regulators at any level of government. In the first days of the rollout, videos of Tesla robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws or behave oddly proliferated online. In one, a Tesla dropping off a passenger did so in the middle of an intersection. In another, a Tesla drives on the wrong side of a double yellow line. In at least two videos, its robotaxis are traveling faster than the posted speed limit. And in several examples, the Tesla cars brake suddenly and passengers say they were confused as to why. In all, NBC News found 13 instances in videos online where a Tesla appeared to break the rules or otherwise make a mistake. In each case, NBC News contacted the people who made the videos but did not hear back. Some elected officials in Austin said they’re worried about the incidents. “There are just a lot of errors,” said Vanessa Fuentes, a member of the Austin City Council and the mayor pro tempore, meaning she runs council meetings when the mayor is absent, in a phone interview. “They have proven that the technology they have is unsafe for Austinites.” And while other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo or former General Motors unit Cruise have been documented on camera making embarrassing or illegal maneuvers, Fuentes said that she doesn’t believe Tesla has coordinated enough with the city government — which Tesla is not legally required to do, but she said would build trust. “Tesla has had no regard for public input or working with our city, and unfortunately, I’m not OK having this done at the expense of Austinites’ safety,” she said. She said she embraces autonomous vehicles in the city as a general matter but would like to see Tesla’s service halted for now. Zo Qadri, an Austin City Council member whose district overlaps with the Tesla robotaxi service area, said he is hearing from people in his district who are worried. “We’ve been seeing chaos unfold. We have a lot of constituents who are very angry,” he said. He said the situation reminded him of problems associated with Cruise robotaxis in Austin in 2023, when residents complained that Cruise cars were making unsafe turns and being a nuisance. Cruise shuttered last year. Qadri said he has not heard similar complaints from constituents about Waymo, which also operates there. It’s not clear whether Tesla could face local consequences for such incidents, such as traffic tickets, for breaking any laws. Fuentes said the process in Austin for ticketing a robotaxi is more complicated than simply writing a ticket for a driver: A police officer must draft a complaint affidavit, send it to a lieutenant, and then have the affidavit witnessed and sent to a municipal court. The Austin Police Department said in a statement: “As with any company operating autonomous technology on public roadways, when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company. These concerns are then addressed through our regular meetings, where we follow up on the issue and review the steps taken to resolve it. Our priority is to maintain public safety while supporting innovation in transportation,” the department said. Federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also took notice of the safety incidents, saying in a statement June 23 that the agency “is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information.” Texas state Rep. Vikki Goodwin, a Democrat whose district includes part of Austin, said she wants Tesla to proceed cautiously. “I think that it’s in their interest to make sure safety is top of mind and that nothing goes wrong. Otherwise, that could really derail their plans for launching it fully,” she said. Goodwin was one of seven Texas lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla on June 18 asking for the company to delay the launch of its robotaxis until Sept. 1 — the day a new law regarding autonomous vehicles is set to go into effect. Tesla did not delay its launch, but Goodwin said the company did respond to their letter, saying it would update its policies to ensure that it would be compliant with the new law. Goodwin said part of her desire for caution comes from owning a Tesla herself and experiencing unexpected maneuvers while using the company’s driver-assistance software. “I’ve had personal experience with using cruise control and having the car brake for me, which can be very disturbing,” she said. “I’ve had that experience on a number of occasions, and it just leads me to believe that it really is important to have a person in the vehicle.” Tesla is aiming to compete with Waymo, which says it has about 1,500 robotaxis on the road in several cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. Musk said Tesla’s service would start small with 10-20 vehicles and try to grow over the next several months, although how quickly it could expand is not clear. Tesla’s stock price soared the day after its service launched on a Sunday, jumping more than 9% on the following Monday. But the stock, which is often volatile, retreated over the following days as it became clear how many hurdles Tesla faces in trying to scale up the service. The public knows about the safety incidents involving Tesla robotaxis mainly because Tesla sent many of the initial invitations to use the service to online influencers, including people with YouTube channels or similar video platforms. The invitations were so scarce that at least one Tesla influencer, a person named Omar who goes by the pseudonym Whole Mars Catalog, offered to share rides for $10. “Take a Tesla Robotaxi ride round trip with Omar. Includes two rides, there and back,” the person’s sponsorship page said. The $10 would be more than the combined cost of two $4.20 rides. The account did not respond to a request for comment. Eliana Sheriff was among the early riders. A video creator with a YouTube channel focused on Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, she said she came away a fan of the robotaxi service. “I was totally trusting of the technology,” she said in a YouTube video on her channel, “Ellie in Space.” She did have one complaint. After she reached her destination in the robotaxi, a storm appeared overhead and she wanted to stay in the car to shelter. A Tesla customer service agent called into the car’s audio system to say that she couldn’t. She exited and called a second ride to take her back to where she started. (Some posts online said erroneously that Tesla kicked her out midride, but she said in an interview that she did reach her destination.) Sheriff said that despite some concerns in the automotive and tech industries over whether Tesla’s technology is good enough to deploy robotaxis, she has faith in Musk to pursue the best approach. “Elon must have a reason for why he believes in that,” she said. She’s not alone. Since the robotaxi launch, the legions of Musk and Tesla fans have proclaimed their enthusiasm for the service across the internet: on X, the social media app that Musk owns, and on other apps such as Reddit and TikTok. And they’ve employed a wide variety of superlatives to describe the robotaxis: “flawless,” “seamless” and “history-making.” But because the service is invite-only, with only a handful of cars on the road, almost no consumers who aren’t Tesla fans have gotten to use the service firsthand. Musk and his fans have described the service as futuristic and groundbreaking, but the rollout has succeeded mainly in preaching to Tesla’s already-converted choir of supporters. Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry who worked for Google’s self-driving car project from 2010 to 2013 before it became Waymo, said Tesla’s most enthusiastic fans are “all fairly convinced that it’s just on the cusp of being ready, and they get really annoyed when other people don’t see it.” Like other experts, Templeton said the only measure for robotaxis that counts is whether they’re safe over the very long term, measured in the tens of millions of miles driven. “What matters is not individual demonstrations. It’s statistics,” he said. Many of the Tesla and Waymo fans clash head-to-head on Reddit, where the message board r/SelfDrivingCars has been heating up with competition between the two sides. Waymo boosters regularly argue on the site that the company is years ahead of Tesla in experience: Waymo had paying customers in its first market, Phoenix, while still using safety drivers in December 2018 — six and a half years ago. Waymo began “rider only” rides in 2019. Lately, some Tesla fans have been pushing back by highlighting videos of what they considered to be Waymo vehicles driving poorly, including stopping in standing water. One Reddit user, in a popular recent post, vented that the r/SelfDrivingCars message board was being “flooded with Tesla apologist propaganda and disinformation. … The astroturf army is out in full display these past couple weeks.” The top comment on the post asked for a truce. “I want to see progress by both companies,” the Reddit user Juice805 wrote. “Waymo is doing great and is quite far ahead in their rollout and Tesla just made a huge first step in theirs.” “I just want cars to drive themselves,” they wrote. They did not respond to a request for comment. David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. Bruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Are Deals Back? IPOs, M&A Recover After 'Liberation Day' Blip

For a while, it looked like the boom in deal activity that was expected after President Donald Trump retook the White House wouldn't happen. Companies pulled IPOs as the Liberation Day tariffs hit sentiment, while others put acquisition plans on hold. Deals, in short, dried up. But that seems to be changing. Deal activity is picking up for a host of reasons, experts say, among them Trump's retreat from some of his harsher tariff plans and increasing investor expectations that trade deals will be struck or tariffs at least kept at their baseline levels. Add to that a relatively resilient U.S. economy and record-high stock markets and you get a recipe for rising deal volume. IPO and M&A volumes are at their highest levels in years, according to Dealogic data, after years when high interest rates put a damper on things. In the first half of 2025, 174 companies raised more than $31 billion from U.S. IPOs, the most since 2021, when a record $200 billion of funds were raised in the same year-to-date period. U.S. M&A volume so far this year has already topped $989 billion, the highest level since 2021's record year, when there were $1.56 trillion in deals in the same period. Trump's Liberation Day tariffs hit stock markets and led companies like Swedish fintech Klarna to pause plans for IPOs. That's changing as investors are piling into tech and fintech firms, and investors are eyeing the possibility of interest-rate cuts in the second half that could keep stocks rising. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), has since seen its shares more than triple since its March listing. USDC stable coin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) was among June's IPO stars, benefiting from the increasing popularity of crytocurrencies and bitcoin; Israel-based retail trading platform eToro (ETOR) and space and defense tech firm Voyager Technologies (VOYG) were also among June's star listings. Circle and CoreWeave "in particular have been outstanding performers and a big driver of investor interest," said Dealogic’s Global ECM Head Samuel Kerr said. The pipeline of new deals is now building up again: In early July, design software maker Figma filed for an IPO. Here are 2025’s top five US IPOs ranked by funds raised, according to Dealogic. LNG exporter Venture Global (VG) raised $1.75 billion from its January IPO, the most by a listing so far this year in the U.S. and the most since Lineage's $5.1 billion listing in July last year. Unlike some more recent tech IPOs, its shares have lagged below their listing price. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), raised $1.57 billion from its listing on the Nasdaq in March. It had a tepid debut, but has since become one of this year's stars, trading more than three times above its $40 IPO price. SailPoint, a Texas-based cybersecurity company that private equity firm Thoma Bravo took private in 2022, made its return to public markets in February, raising $1.38 billion from its listing. Its shares continue to lag its $23 IPO price. Crypto firm Circle Internet Group (CRCL) has been one of this year's IPO stars, raising $1.21 billion from its IPO priced at $31 a share in June; the stablecoin issuer's stock is now around $189. The fifth-biggest IPO this year was the $994 million June offer by fintech firm Chime Financial. Its shares remain above their $27 IPO price. M&A volumes, which like IPOs took a hit this year, have been helped by enthusiasm for companies linked to artificial intelligence. “Although March brought a burst of large-cap deals, optimism faded in April after ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs sent shockwaves through the market," Mergermarket Head Lucinda Guthrie said. "Still, the opportunities presented by the volatility in the public markets drew attention from private capital. A key deal driver in 1H25 has been M&A to fuel the evolving AI landscape. " Here are the top M&A deals so far this year in the U.S, according to Dealogic, ranked by deal size, with No. 1, the funding round into ChatGPT maker OpenAI— illustrating the allure of AI investments. (All the deal volumes are excluding debt.) The ChatGPT maker raised $40 billion in new funding from a group of investors who took a 13.3% stake in a round led by SoftBank Group. Other investors included its biggest backer, Microsoft (MSFT). Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) struck a $32 billion cash deal for cybersecurity startup Wiz in March that would be the tech giant’s largest acquisition ever. The deal hasn't closed yet. In June, Swiss building-materials company Holcim spun off its North American operations in a $28.7 billion deal. The Chicago-based cement and roofing provider started trading under the stock symbol (AMRZ). Charter Communications (CHTR) announced a $24.1 billion deal in May to buy privately held rival Cox Communications in a deal that would combine two of the U.S.'s largest cable providers. The deal has yet to close. Nuclear power producer Constellation Energy (CEG) agreed to buy private energy company Calpine for $17 billion excluding debt, a transaction that would create the largest clean energy provider in the U.S. The combined company would serve the AI boom, feeding the growing power needs of data centers.

Zoho's Sridhar Vembu proposes a radical shift in India's urban planning, advocating for massive public transportation investments to combat traffic congestion. He argues that infrastructure costs grow disproportionately with city size, making megacities economically unsustainable. Vembu champions smaller cities, between 100,000 and 250,000, as a more balanced and sustainable model for urban development, reflecting Zoho's strategic placement in such towns.
