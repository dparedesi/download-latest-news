Skip to comments. Posted on 08/14/2025 9:21:43 AM PDT by MagillaX SpaceX warned on Wednesday that Virginia is planning to spend over ten times what was required for its proposed high-speed internet access program by not sharing a large chunk of the incentives for Starlink. In a letter addressed to the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development, SpaceX said that the final proposal for the program was a “massive waste of federal taxpayer money,” before noting that SpaceX could have served virtually every eligible household at $60 million, compared with the $613 million in expenditure proposed by the Commonwealth. “Simply put, Virginia has put its heavy thumb on the scale in favor of expensive, slow-to-build fiber bias over speedy, low-cost, and technology-neutral competition,” SpaceX wrote in the latter as Virginia chose the Elon Musk-headed company for only 5,579 of the total 133,000 locations selected for subsidized broadband installations. The program at the center of the controversy is called the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD), an $42.5 billion initiative of the Biden administration to enhance internet access for Americans across the country. The Trump administration tweaked the program to shift from fibre-based broadband to ‘technology neutrality’ and paved the way for satellite broadband providers such as Starlink and fixed wireless service providers. Retail sentiment on Stocktwits about AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), another satellite broadband provider, was in the ‘bullish’ territory at the time of writing. SpaceX further alleged that, according to Virginia’s current plan, Starlink will receive $3.2 million in funding, which translates to approximately $584 per site, while faster fiber installations can cost around $6,000 to $8,000 per site. The company said that Virginia “failed to observe technology neutrality,” before adding that Starlink could provide faster broadband and “at one-tenth of the cost.” (Excerpt) Read more at in.investing.com ...

The deep state sees fiber as an infrastructure jobs package. And maybe with some political kickbacks. The current governor is on his way out of what has recently been a blue state and finds himself surrounded by political deep state. And hard to tell friend or foe at times. Louisiana put forward their proposal with a cap of competitive 8k per service while Virginia was nearly double. And may be the reason no complaint has been levied by StarLink on Louisiana. There are legitimate concerns for Low Earth Satellite and there are some interesting opportunities it presents as well. I would hope Sec.

Title: Global stocks rally fizzles out as US bond yields rise
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/08/14/global-stocks-rally-fizzles-out-as-us-bond-yields-rise/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T16:18:19Z
Full Content:
A rally in European stocks slowed while US equities tread water as markets digested stronger-than-expected wholesale price inflation data and US bond yields rose. The Iseq index rose by 1.1 per cent, slightly outperforming its European peers. Cairn Homes jumped 2 per cent after lodging new plans for 236 apartments and 16 houses from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for its site at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin. The Irish banks also moved higher as part of a wider sectoral move across Europe. AIB climbed 3.4 per cent to close at €7.41 per share, while Bank of Ireland jumped 2.1 per cent to €13.22. Ryanair also advanced, adding 0.6 per cent to €26.30 per share while other large caps like Kingspan and Kerry Group were little changed. Adding to Wednesday’s 16 per cent surge, Glanbia added another 1.4 per cent to close at €14.32 per share after the nutritionals group raised its earnings forecast earlier in the previous session. European shares touched two-week highs as the blue-chip Stoxx 50 added 0.7 per cent and the pan-European Stoxx 600 advanced by 0.5 per cent. Insurers were in the spotlight with the likes of Swiss Re reporting earnings. The firm was down 3.9 per cent on the session, despite reporting better than expected net profits for the first half. Meanwhile, Carlsberg fell 5.5 per cent after the Danish brewer missed half-year profit and volume forecasts, and said it did not expect any improvement in the consumer environment this year. Thyssenkrupp tumbled 8.9 per cent after the German conglomerate cut its full-year outlook for investments and sales, citing disruption from US tariffs. After three consecutive sessions of gains, British stocks were little changed, with the benchmark FTSE 100 essentially flat on the session and the mid-cap FTSE 250 index down by 0.2 per cent. Insurers led sectoral gains with Aviva jumping 2.4 per cent after jumping to its highest level since 2007 earlier in the session. The group raised its interim dividend on Thursday after reporting a stronger half-year operating profit. British insurer Admiral hit a record high, rising 5.8 per cent after a strong first-half profit. The energy sector was the main drag on the FTSE 100, down 1.3 per cent Harbour Energy led the losses, falling 4.5 per cent, while oil majors Shell and BP fell by 1.5 per cent and 0.9 per cent. Industrial metal miners also retreated amid weakness in copper and iron ore prices, with Rio Tinto down by 4 per cent and Anglo American down by 1.7 per cent. Among individual stocks, British Gas owner Centrica rose 2.5 per cent after announcing it will jointly buy National Grid’s Grain LNG terminal with US-based Energy Capital Partners for about £1.5 billion (€1.7 billion). Wall Street’s main indices were little changed in early trading on Thursday despite a stronger-than-anticipated inflation reading that spurred a rise in bond yields and the dollar. US wholesale inflation accelerated in July by the most in three years, suggesting companies are passing along higher import costs related to tariffs, raising the spectre of renewed price pressures and causing traders to trim bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next month. After a recent rocket-fuelled rally, the S&P 500 was flat despite gains in big tech stocks. Cisco Systems lost 1 per cent after the network equipment manufacturer’s broadly in-line forecast did little to encourage investors. Deere & Co fell 8 per cent after the farm-equipment maker reported a lower quarterly profit and tightened its annual profit forecast, while Tapestry plunged 17.6 per cent after the Coach handbag maker forecast annual profit below estimates. – Additional reporting: Reuters/Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Ian Curran is a Business reporter with The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

This announcement is made in accordance with Article 14 of the Belgian Act of 2 May 2007 on the disclosure of major participations in issuers of which shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market and regarding miscellaneous provisions. To access a copy of the aforementioned transparency notification, reference is made to Sequana Medical's website (https://www.sequanamedical.com/investors/shareholder-information/).

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +32 9 292 8065 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical is commencing US commercialisation through a small speciality salesforce initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com. Important Safety Information: For important safety information regarding the alfapump® system, see https://www.sequanamedical.com/wp-content/uploads/ISI.pdf. The alfapump® System is currently not approved in Canada. DSR® therapy is still in development and is currently not approved in any country. The safety and effectiveness of DSR® therapy has not been established. Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.

Title: Who Thought It Was a Good Idea to Put Matt Rife in a Make-Up Ad?
URL: https://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/elf-cosmetics-faces-backlash-after-including-matt-rife-in-makeup-ad.php
Time Published: 2025-08-14T15:39:11Z

By Kayleigh Donaldson | Celebrity | August 14, 2025 For some reason, Matt Rife has remained weirdly popular over the past few years. Despite a cavalcade of misogynistic jokes, palling around with Jordan Peterson, and pissing off Marc Maron, the man with the iPad jaw has kept getting work. He recently bought Ed and Lorraine Warren’s home and Occult Museum, which includes all of the fake haunted stuff those scammers claimed to have dealt with over the course of their deceitful careers. That seems like a good match of personalities, I suppose. It certainly makes more sense than putting Rife in an advert for make-up. e.l.f. Cosmetics paired up Rife with drag queen Heidi N. Closet for an ad on ‘beauty injustices.’ That means over-priced make-up, not brands taking massive investments from companies like BlackRock, which was listed in a recent report from the United Nations mapping out the corporations aiding Israel in the displacement of Palestinians during their siege on Gaza. It’s a weird ad and Rife’s weird face doesn’t help matters. View this post on Instagram A post shared by e.l.f. Cosmetics and Skincare (@elfcosmetics) A post shared by e.l.f. Cosmetics and Skincare (@elfcosmetics) Why is Matt Rife in this? Putting aside the misogyny and his off-putting personality and his desperation to appeal to men because he was so embarrassed by his once-dedicated female fanbase: what does this man have to do with make-up? Would you buy anything beauty-related from this man? Does he have good genes… I mean jeans? Having drag artists do something like this at least makes sense. Maybe if one of the contestants of King of Drag was there alongside Heidi, I’d appreciate some consistency. If Rife does wear concealer, I don’t for a minute think he’d admit to it, at least not without making some homophobic gag in the process. Plus, the irony of a guy who got famous making jokes about domestic violence playing a lawyer? Hmm… e.l.f. Cosmetics probably wanted people to react with the same fake fervour of American Eagle’s Sydney Sweeney ads. Mostly, their core demographic just thought this was dumb and didn’t want a gross sexist near their eyeshadow. So, they issued a ‘we’re listening and we hear you’ non-apology, because why not? A post shared by e.l.f. Cosmetics and Skincare (@elfcosmetics) This is as believable as Matt Rife claiming his Crimson Chin-esque jaw growth was down to puberty. Bless. You may be entitled to compensation on that one, Matty. Comments require JavaScript to load.

Ark Invest said it bought more than 2.5 million shares of crypto platform Bullish (BLSH) on the day of the company’s explosive debut on the New York Stock Exchange, securing a stake valued at more than $170 million by the end of the day. Shares of the company, which owns CoinDesk, surged to as high as $102 from the $37 IPO pricing, before closing at $68, an 84% gain. The company sold 20.3 million shares for its initial public offering, which had also attracted interest from BlackRock (BLK), according to a filing with the SEC. Ark added 1,714,522 BLSH shares to its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), 545,416 shares to the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and 272,755 shares to the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). Bullish's rally extended into Thursday, recently trading 15% higher. That performance comes as the broader crypto market slipped, erasing part of the prior day’s gains when bitcoin BTC$117,359.14 hit a record high of $124,000. The CoinDesk 20 Index is down about 2.1% over the past 24 hours. Other recently listed crypto-related stocks fell. Circle (CRCL), which went public in June, fell about 2% Thursday, while trading platform eToro (ETOR) dropped nearly 3%. Wood has a track record of making sizable early moves in newly public crypto firms. Upon Circle’s IPO, Ark purchased about 4.5 million shares, valued at roughly $373 million at the time. Those shares are now worth about $675 million. Her stake in eToro is smaller — around 140,000 shares — currently valued at $6.5 million. Bullish’s strong debut and Ark’s rapid allocation across multiple ETFs highlight growing investor interest in publicly traded crypto infrastructure companies, even as market volatility remains high.

Title: Bitcoin In Retirement Funds—Here’s The 69% Monthly Dividend Play

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The US is quietly monetizing its $36 trillion deficit (printing money to pay for it). Just around the edges. For now. Which supports more upside for this 69% dividend that is powered by Bitcoin. And Uncle Sam’s money printer. Yes, Fed Chair Jay Powell is stubbornly sticking with high rates. Vanilla pundits claim a “hawkish” Fed is supportive of the US dollar. Yes, but—let’s look past Powell’s hollow words for his actions! Behind the scenes, the Fed is quietly “buying” up to $25 billion monthly from Treasury auctions. Without Fed involvement, less demand would mean higher rates to attract buyers. Who wants to fund Uncle Sam’s “spend like a drunken sailor” habit? So when an auction is slow, the Fed picks up the slack. If you are scratching your head, you’re on to something. The Fed has the same income as my seven-year-old—zero. My daughter asks mom or dad to pay for the ice cream. The Fed essentially creates the cash out of thin air to buy the bonds. This is effectively printing new money. The Treasury issues, the Fed absorbs! This is bearish for the buck and explains why it is down 10% year-to-date relative to other major currencies. And why monetary hedges such as gold and Bitcoin have soared in 2025. In a minute we’ll highlight a Bitcoin ETF that yields 69%. (No, that is not a typo.) But first, let’s discuss another policymaker trick. Treasury debt—which the Fed is helping mop up—has traditionally been issued at the long end of the curve. Think bonds of 10 and 30 years in duration, purchased by pension funds and sovereigns. Janet Yellen flipped this on its head during the end of her term as Treasury Secretary in another effort to keep long rates from rising. She began issuing 75% of government debt on the “short end” of the yield curve—two years in duration or less. This “short instead of long” issuing practice was unheard of only a few years ago. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was critical of this practice. However, he has not only continued it but also turned up the volume a notch. Scotty dishes 80% of the debt in short duration! By issuing more short-term debt, the US needn’t rely on the “kindness” of strangers (other sovereign nations) and pension funds to finance its deficit. Banks can permanently stash more (cheaper!) short-term debt on their balance sheets. Recent legislative changes will let banks lend (long) against this debt, indirectly contributing to monetary expansion. Which brings us to Bitcoin. Historically, gold was the haven against monetary mismanagement. Today, Bitcoin – the “OG crypto”—is rapidly emerging as a credible alternative store of value, endorsed by financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley. The bullish Bitcoin news keeps coming. Last week, President Trump signed an executive order allowing Bitcoin as an investment option in 401(k) retirement plans. “America’s ticker” SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) will have some competition, especially with millennial retirement participants! In April, we added ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) to our Dividend Swing Trader portfolio to play this trend. BITO harvests premiums from Bitcoin contracts and pays an impressive monthly dividend annualizing to a sizzling 69%: I look at BITO as more of a trading vehicle than a “buy and hold” forever idea. After all, Bitcoin plummeted more than 75% between late 2021 and 2022. I’m not comfortable with readers risking that type of drawdown. Fortunately, we don’t have to. BITO makes for a great Dividend Swing Trading fund. Bitcoin, which drives the price (and payouts) of BITO, tends to rally sharply and sustain momentum for months at a time. This is exactly the type of holding period we strive for at DST. We like to buy right and then sit on our hands as gains accrue (swing, if you will) in our favor. We’re up 36% since our initial BITO purchase, a trade that annualizes to 118%. The fund has already paid us back 19% of our original purchase price in dividends. Plus, it has appreciated in price. When it dips, we buy more. On June 17, I issued an alert that BITO was a Best Buy—it has rallied 11.2% since (109% annualized). And that’s all before factoring in the new 401(k) catalyst. Last Thursday in DST, BITO topped our Best Buy list again. It didn’t take long to pop—3.6% in four days (for a terrific 2,600%+ annualized).

Title: Analysts believe $10,000 Ethereum price is inevitable as institutional buying increases, PEPE and RTX could 20x

Analysts are becoming increasingly confident that the Ethereum price will hit $10,000 as institutional buying accelerates. Massive inflows from large funds are pushing ETH into a stronger position than ever, with BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone adding $640 million worth of ETH in a single day. While Ethereum dominates headlines, traders are also paying close attention to the PEPE coin and an emerging project called Remittix, which many believe could rival the biggest names in the next bull cycle. These three assets are becoming central to discussions on the best crypto project 2025 and the next big altcoin 2025. Source: TradingView The Ethereum price is currently trading around $4,630, just 5% below its all-time high. This move comes after a breakout from a multi-year pattern, backed by over $10 billion in institutional inflows. As historical data has shown, ETH tends to hit 30-35 percent of Bitcoin market cap during major runs, which would put the Ethereum price between 8,500 and 10,000 dollars in case Bitcoin hits 150,000 dollars. In-chain statistics also indicate that long-term holders invest with confidence whereas short-term traders are taking profits. Analysts think that these trends and increasing use in DeFi project ecosystems and cross-chain DeFi project integrations, indicate continuing upward pressure. This optimism is why many still list ETH among the top crypto to buy now and the best long-term crypto investment. The PEPE coin has recently seen trading volumes double to nearly $900 million, signaling renewed market interest. A whale investor turned $200,000 into nearly $2 million after holding PEPE for nine months, highlighting the token’s explosive potential. The PEPE price chart shows a symmetrical triangle pattern that often leads to significant breakouts. Source: DexGemsReal If the PEPE coin moves above key resistance at $0.00001600, analysts predict gains of up to 773%, potentially pushing it toward $0.00010. With rising open interest and spot market inflows, this low cap crypto gem could surprise many in 2025. For traders seeking the next 100x crypto or crypto with passive income potential, PEPE remains firmly on the watchlist. While Ethereum price targets dominate the headlines, Remittix is quietly building momentum that could outpace both ETH and the PEPE coin in percentage gains. The project has already raised over $19.3 million through the sale of more than 596 million tokens at $0.0922 each. Unlike most hype-driven projects, Remittix delivers real-world utility with a platform designed to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Its audited smart contracts, mobile wallet with real-time FX conversion and upcoming centralized exchange listing reveal a project with strong fundamentals. Why Remittix Could Dominate the Next Bull Run This combination of tech and utility positions Remittix as one of the best DeFi projects 2025 and a crypto solving real-world problems, making it a serious contender for the fastest growing crypto 2025. Ethereum price momentum, PEPE coin’s breakout potential and Remittix’s strong fundamentals create a compelling trio for investors. ETH is the best long term crypto investment to gain institutional exposure, PEPE is a high growth crypto to add to a risk tolerant portfolio and Remittix has the rare combination of utility and growth. These assets may set the stage for the future of crypto projects and early stage crypto investment opportunities as the next big crypto launch cycle heats up.

MHP state that the scheme "will facilitate increased housing supply and choice along Cross Avenue and its environs, which is also located 1km southwest of Blackrock Village". MHP further state that "the design rationale is to create and deliver a high quality sustainable residential development within this strategic infill site which respects its suburban setting and maximises the site's natural attributes while making maximum efficiency of existing infrastructure". The developers are proposing a density of 100 units per hectare and MHP state that "the proposed density and mix is considered suitable for the site ensuring a sufficient quantum of units is provided whilst also protecting the amenity of existing adjoining residential properties". As part of its social housing obligations, Cairn Homes is proposing to sell 25 units to the Council. A letter from the Council states that "while the unit costs exceed the Council's approved acquisition cost threshold, it is acknowledged that the stated costs are estimated, as actual costs cannot be quantified at this preliminary stage". The Council letter states that "the Council may seek a revision of the Part V proposal following evaluation of costs and land values". Reporting by Gordon Deegan © RTÉ 2025.

Ethereum is closing in on its all-time high, and investors are asking if this is just a rally or the start of a decade-defining bull run. Trading near $4,605 after touching $4,783, Ethereum has surged 16% in five days, driven by institutional buying, ETF approvals, and the powerful impact of the Pectra upgrade. Analysts at Fundstrat call it “the biggest macro trade of the next decade,” with price targets as high as $15,000 by year-end.

Title: Hutchison Sees “Reasonable Chance” of $22.8 bln Ports Sale Going Through

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Clare Jim and Donny Kwok HONG KONG, Aug 14 (Reuters) – CK Hutchison said on Thursday its $22.8 billion ports business sale had a “reasonable chance” of going through after a plan to add a Chinese major strategic investor to the buying consortium, as it tries to navigate through Sino-U.S. tensions. CK Hutchison, based in the Chinese-controlled territory of Hong Kong, has faced heavy criticism from Beijing since unveiling a plan in March to sell 43 ports in 23 countries, including two near the Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock BLK.N and Italian Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run shipping firm MSC. President Donald Trump had called for the U.S. to “take back” the Panama Canal, which is used by more than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion annually, from Chinese influence. CK Hutchison’s ports are not on the canal or part of it, however. “We are into a new stage of our deal,” group co-managing director and finance director Frank Sixt told analysts at an earnings conference. “There is a reasonable chance that those discussions will lead to a deal that is good for all of the parties, ourselves included. And most importantly, that we’ll be capable of being approved by all of the relevant authorities.” On July 28, the conglomerate said it was in talks to include a Chinese “major strategic investor” in the bid for its ports, and that it would allow as much time as needed to secure approval in relevant jurisdictions. On Thursday, Sixt said these included China, the U.S., Britain and the European Union. He said the talks were taking much longer than expected but that this was “not particularly troublesome” because the port business had delivered stronger earnings and cash flow this year than expected. Sources have said the investor is COSCO – one of the world’s dominant, vertically integrated marine transportation firms. They said COSCO wanted a bigger stake while the other parties were keen to keep it a minority. ALLAYING CHINESE CONCERNS The inclusion of a Chinese investor would alleviate Beijing’s security concerns and have its blessing, the sources and other experts have said. COSCO did not respond to a request last month for comment. Thursday’s results conference was the first opportunity for analysts to quiz management about the ports deal. But chairman Victor Li, eldest son of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, who took over the conglomerate from his father, was missing for the first time, as was deputy chairman Canning Fok. Also unusually, CK Hutchison did not brief analysts or media about its 2024 earnings when it released them in March. Its shares closed down 0.4% on Thursday ahead of the results, in line with the Hang Seng Index .HSI. The conglomerate posted an 11% rise in first-half underlying profit to HK$11.3 billion ($1.44 billion) on a post-IFRS 16 basis. UBS had forecast a 6% rise. However, including one-time non-cash accounting loss, notably from the merger of 3UK and Vodafone UK, net profit dropped 92% year-on-year to HK$852 million. The company said global trade and consumer demand affecting its ports business would remain volatile in the second half due to uncertainty over trade disputes and geopolitical risks.

Title: Exclusive: Former Goldman Sachs exec heads to crypto startup founded by former Meta engineers

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Another Wall Street executive is defecting to the crypto industry. Mustafa Al Niama, former head of the Americas digital assets desk for investment bank Goldman Sachs, is joining blockchain developer Mysten Labs as head of capital markets, he told Fortune. He’ll help lead the crypto company’s outreach to large financial institutions, he said. “The objective is to expand that sphere materially more than what we have today,” Al Niama added. He’s the latest from the world of Wall Street to join an industry populated not so long ago by teens and twentysomethings in hoodies. Others include Mary-Catherine Lader, a former rising star at asset manager BlackRock who jumped ship in 2021 to join Uniswap Labs. There’s also Tom Farley, former president of the New York Stock Exchange, who joined crypto exchange Bullish as CEO in 2023. The flow of Wall Street executives into crypto mirrors the increasing integration of two sectors that were once thought to be opposites. Large banks like JPMorgan Chase are experimenting with issuing digital tokens meant to represent one dollar of deposits. And other institutions are exploring how to tokenize money-market funds, or put financial assets into blockchain wrappers. Al Niama already has experience sitting between Wall Street and crypto. He spent four years at American Express before he switched over to Goldman Sachs in 2015, where he eventually worked his way up to becoming a regional head on the firm’s digital assets desk. One of the initiatives he led was a collaboration announced in July between Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York, or BNY, to launch tokenized money-market funds. Now, he’s joining one of the most deep-pocketed firms in crypto. Founded by former engineers from Meta’s scuttled stablecoin project, Libra, Mysten Labs has raised about $336 million from prominent firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Franklin Templeton, according to PitchBook. (The company also raised significant sums from the venture arm of the failed crypto exchange FTX but bought back the stake after FTX declared bankruptcy.)

Title: Adtech Stocks Tumble as AI, Increased Competition Weigh on Revenue

A turbulent Q2 earnings season has divided the adtech sector, as investors sell off shares of The Trade Desk, PubMatic, and Viant. Compared to the NASDAQ Composite, indicative of the broader market’s health, adtech stocks are trending down. Few firms, including AppLovin and Criteo, have been able to weather the selloff. Experts say the latest figures underscore the challenges facing adtech companies today; chief among them is competition with Big Tech titans who are increasingly entering their territory. The sector is now “operating in a market dominated by Google, Meta, and Amazon—three vertically integrated giants that collectively control the lion’s share of digital ad spend,” said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next. “They not only run the largest ad networks but also own the platforms, data, and exchanges, allowing them to extract value from every part of the digital supply chain—often at the expense of publishers, advertisers and adtech companies.” Add in the complexities of navigating the AI boom—which is causing upheaval in how people search and stifling publisher traffic—and adtech companies are finding themselves in a new kind of pressure cooker. Demand-side platform The Trade Desk basked in Wall Street’s good graces throughout 2024 and into early 2025, as its share price soared and Q1 revenues achieved 26% year-over-year growth. But the tides have quickly turned: The stock plunged nearly 40% late last week on the back of the company’s Q2 earnings report, which showed slowing revenue growth and heightened competition from Big Tech firms like Amazon. CEO Jeff Green insisted on a call with investors that “Amazon is not a competitor.” Financial analysts expect a declining growth rate for The Trade Desk throughout the second half of the year. PubMatic, a leading sell-side platform, cited changes by a top demand-side partner in July for revenue hiccups. Its stock is down about 20% since earnings were reported Monday, and more than 30% over the last two weeks. The company’s CEO Rajeev Goel said on a call with investors that “a top DSP buyer shifted a significant number of clients to a new platform that evaluates inventory differently, impacting our revenue.” He added that PubMatic plans to “diversify ad spend away from legacy DSPs.” MNTN, the CTV darling that shot to prominence with the help of Ryan Reynolds and his creative agency Maximum Effort, saw shares tumble after reporting its first-ever earnings on the back of a May IPO. Only a few major firms have been able to weather the adtech selloff. Chief among them is AppLovin, which helps developers monetize mobile apps with ads. In June, AppLovin sold off its mobile apps business, which spurred increased investor confidence and netted it.$400 million in cash. The stock saw double-digit growth last week after it reported Q2 earnings that showed a 77% jump in revenue year-over-year, to $1.26 billion. AppLovin surpassed The Trade Desk last year to become the largest adtech company by market cap. Zeta Global, which positions itself as an AI-powered marketing cloud platform, has seen increased investor interest over the last two weeks. Criteo, a commerce-focused DSP, is also holding its own, even as rivals pose a growing threat. Meanwhile, the two leading ad verification vendors, Integral Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify, were split. IAS’s stock spiked after an August 7 earnings report that included better-than-expected publisher performance, plus an adjusted EBITDA of $109.84 million. DoubleVerify, however, fared poorer. The firm beat revenue estimates, but missed on earnings per share. The adtech sector is entering the back half of 2025 with investor sentiment sharply divided, compounded by anxieties over AI and macroeconomic uncertainty in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs and steady inflation. Some analysts are confident about the industry as a whole, but see this selloff as a sign of splintering and increased competition. “Adtech companies are in a surprisingly solid place, by which I mean most businesses are running well enough with low double-digit growth on average, and mostly with growing profitability,” said Brian Wieser, principal and CEO of Madison and Wall. “If there’s a problem, it’s that there is no consolidator, and so the business seems likely to remain a fragmented, almost cottage industry, with a large number of mid-sized companies but few giants.” Kendra Barnett is Adweek's senior tech reporter.

Title: BlackRock’s Rick Rieder says this is the ‘best investing environment ever’ — he’s conveniently in the running for next Fed chairman

Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia. BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, Rick Rieder, is bullish. He says the landscape has never looked so good for investing and believes Jerome Powell should be cutting interest rates. Rieder also happens to be in the running for Fed chairman, according to numerous reports. While the White House will be mindful of the fact that Jerome Powell’s successor will need to be a credible economic force, President Trump has also been clear that the next chair will be more dovish than the current one. Trump has been waging a one-sided war against the Fed since winning the Oval Office (and indeed began criticizing Powell even before the election), aggressively lobbying the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cut rates. Having awarded the Fed chairman the nickname of “Too Late Powell,” Trump has turned his attention to Powell’s replacement when his term ends in May 2026. Trump has said he will name that individual shortly, potentially in a move to shift the market’s attention to the incumbent, dovish power. Rieder appears on a list of candidates in the running for that job, according to reports from CNBC and Fox Business. And the CIO is saying many of the things the Trump camp will want to hear. Speaking to CNBC’s Closing Bell yesterday, Rieder said a few “extraordinary things” in the economy had convinced him that now is the “best investing environment ever.” “First of all, the technicals and equities are crazy,” Rieder said. “[The] amount of cash on the sideline, the amount of buybacks relative to the IPO calendar—i.e., the demand versus supply—is pretty extraordinary. “Then you take the other side of it in fixed income—I think the Fed can cut rates, but until then—you got yield levels, you can create a portfolio with a 6.5%, 7% yield. That’s pretty good.” Rieder added that volatility in equities is relatively low at the moment, minimizing downside risks. Along with bullish signals on the Wall Street side (a token of approval that President Trump has demonstrated is important to him), Rieder is also confident of the need to cut the base rate from its current level of 4.25% to 4.5%. “I think it’s almost a given that they cut [in September],” Rieder said. “You’re seeing some sogginess around job hires, around job openings … more slack coming into the labor market. I still think the funds rate, you can get it down faster and more aggressively than where they are today.” Rieder did say the Fed will have to remain “respectful” of tariff costs. Markets will like this if he wins the Fed role as they, too, are pricing in some level of inflation as a result of the White House’s import cost regime. It will also be a check beside his name in the eyes of analysts, who will see it as a mark of independence from the political rhetoric, which is to insist that foreign governments will “eat” the hikes. President Trump, on the other hand, won’t like hearing talk of tariff inflation. In a note previously reported by Fortune, Goldman Sachs economist Elsie Peng wrote that the majority of tariff costs are likely to be passed through to consumers. This sparked fury from President Trump, who urged Goldman CEO David Solomon to “get a new economist” or consider resigning. The Fed sticks closely to its dual mandate of inflation at a target rate of 2% and maximum employment. The base interest rate is its lever to control these two factors. Breaking with tradition, Rieder suggested the base rate isn’t that useful when it comes to controlling price rises. He noted: “The interest rate tool doesn’t do a lot today. You think about how companies finance capex … You’re not borrowing. The banks are asset liability. The interest rate tool is not that important except for a couple of big factors. What it does to housing, and you look at mortgage applications, building permits, housing starts, new home sales—it’s stuck. “The mortgage rate has to come down, you drop the funds rate, there’s some yield curve [steepening] that probably happens. And then the other side of it is the low-income people who are borrowers. They are getting hurt by this; high-savings older people are actually benefiting from the high rates.” BlackRock declined Fortune’s request for comment. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: To Make Democracy Work, Give More of It to Workers

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The fight to reclaim American democracy has to begin with our oligarchic political economy. An Amazon worker affiliated with the Teamsters on strike at a company delivery hub in Maspeth, Queens, last year. The 2024 election was a referendum on democracy—one that democracy lost fair and square. As loudly and as forcefully as Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the Democratic Party as a whole argued that Donald Trump posed a threat to America’s democratic institutions, he was reelected with both an Electoral College majority and the Republican Party’s first popular vote plurality in 20 years. The polls suggest many wound up backing Trump for economic reasons—as troubled as they might have been by his antidemocratic rhetoric and effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the hope that Trump could ease the cost of living won out over the warnings about his authoritarianism and the democratic abstractions that became central to the Harris campaign’s closing message. That was only partially the Harris campaign’s fault—by habit, we tend to fret about the state of our political institutions and the state of our economy separately. But our understanding of democracy, and our defenses of it, should be shaped by materialism—an understanding that economic conditions and alignments of economic power determine the extent to which the governed can govern. Our Constitution, for instance, was profoundly shaped by economic conditions at the time it was written. Troubled by the demands struggling Americans were making of government after the American Revolution, our founders designed a federal system that frustrates our ability to democratically address our economic concerns and other matters to this day. And money in politics today has made matters worse—on top of the Constitution’s antidemocratic design, corporations and the wealthy shape policy in ways visible and invisible to ordinary Americans on the outside looking in. Fixing the latter problem would take more than imposing new limits on how the economic elite can directly engage in politics, as important as that goal remains. Corporations and the wealthy exert their political influence through a variety of indirect channels, from the media to their social circles. This means that an ordinary American would still wield far less political power—and be far more subject to political domination—than a millionaire or billionaire even with major campaign finance and lobbying reforms. But another way to counter the domination of the wealthy in our politics would be to democratically restructure the economy—granting the American worker more agency and ensuring that economic power and resources accrue to more than a wealthy few in the first place. In doing so, we’d not only reduce inequality to the benefit of our political institutions, but also, of course, to the material benefit of everyday Americans—demonstrating that democracy is worth fighting for not just as a political abstraction but a means of improving our working lives. In the 1980s, the democratic theorist Robert Dahl posed a key question often overlooked in both our political reform and economic policy debates: “What about the ownership and control of economic enterprises as a source of political inequality?” Ownership and control contribute to the creation of great differences among citizens in wealth, income, status, skills, information, control over information and propaganda, access to political leaders and, on the average, predictable life chances, not only for mature adults but also for the unborn, infants, and children. After all due qualifications have been made, differences like these help in turn to generate significant inequalities among citizens in their capacities and opportunities for participating as political equals in governing the state. As Dahl observed, the design of our basic economic institutions—including the structure and ownership of companies—clearly matters. It’s plain that our efforts to tackle inequality will be incomplete unless we’re willing to address how they produce inequality to begin with. And beyond the fact that the wealth and economic power that accrues to investors and those at the top of firms is leveraged for influence within our political institutions, the subordination of workers is also democratically troubling in itself. We spend roughly a third of our lives at work and earn our livelihoods there. The decisions made in corporate boardrooms and on Wall Street often affect us more directly, immediately, and intimately than decisions that are made in Washington or in our state capitols and city halls. Yet most Americans take it entirely for granted that we’re not entitled to a say in how the companies we work for function. This should change. If democracy is desirable because it gives us a measure of agency over the conditions that shape our lives—helping us master our own fates rather than living as the mere subjects of the powerful or the victims of circumstance—we should work to bring democratic values into the economy. Though we’ve long forgotten it, the coming of “economic democracy”—and, specifically, democracy within firms—was once seen as an inevitable development by many thinkers and political figures, particularly in the first half of the last century. In the aftermath of World War II, for instance, the philosopher John Dewey predicted that the conflict would lead to a democratic revolution in industrial organization. “It is so common to point out the absurdity of conducting a war for political democracy which leaves industrial and economic autocracy practically untouched,” he wrote, “that I think we are absolutely bound to see, after the war, either a period of very great unrest…or a movement to install the principle of self-government within industries.” That didn’t happen. But for a time, the postwar economy did deliver Americans a measure of economic democracy—thanks to the growth of the American labor movement. While much of the economic growth and prosperity America experienced in the decades immediately following the war was spurred by the social and economic investments of a federal government much bigger and bolder than ours is today, economies are built upon the backs of workers. The drivers and the miners, the clerks and the cooks, those who build and fix and clean and carry, those who staff the factories and the shops—whatever politicians and their donors say about the wealthy “job creators” at the top of companies, it’s the job doers to whom we owe everything. And for generations, job doers seeking a greater share of the prosperity they produce have turned to labor unions. In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act, guaranteed most private-sector workers the right to organize and to bargain for better pay and working conditions. As a result, union membership spiked—in the 12 years after its enactment, nearly 11 million Americans joined up. In 1935, about 13 percent of the country’s workforce had been unionized. By 1955, that proportion jumped to roughly one-third of American workers. Beyond getting the American people a better deal at work, unions used that newfound strength to push the New Deal and Great Society agendas forward—by politically organizing and mobilizing their workers, unions helped win the fights for Medicare and other major programs. Both in the workplace and at the ballot box, unions played a significant role in ensuring that the gains from our economic growth flowed to workers and not just the already wealthy. According to one 2021 paper, increasing union membership alone likely explains nearly a quarter of the decline in American inequality from 1936 to 1968. And while union families earned 10 to 20 percent more in income than nonunion families between the 1940s and the 2010s, unions also made nonunion workers better off than they otherwise would have been—to compete with union workplaces for new hires and to keep their employees content, even nonunion workplaces wound up offering better pay and working conditions. The gains unions delivered for American workers should be understood as the products of economic democracy. After all, workers form unions by majority rule — either in elections administered by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or by an employer’s voluntary recognition that a majority of its workers in a given unit have signed cards to form a union. Once unionized, workers are able to exercise real agency through bargaining and to voice their ideas and concerns about work in ways that are protected by law. Naturally, the wealthy and their backers in Washington fought back against the growth of unions as quickly and as doggedly as they could. In 1947, over a veto by President Truman, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which imposed a laundry list of restrictions on union activity and included other measures to limit their growth. Among the most significant of them was granting states the ability to pass “right to work” laws, which are often framed as granting workers the right not to join a union. But American workers never have to join unions if they don’t want to—workers who don’t want to be members of a union at their workplaces can instead pay fees that cover the costs of the union’s bargaining activity on their behalf rather than actual union dues. What “right to work” laws actually do is starve unions of resources by ensuring workers in unionized workplaces don’t have to pay unions anything at all. The proliferation of those laws and the other limitations on labor organizing imposed by the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act put the brakes on the growth of the labor movement. And further disempowering it became one of the cornerstones of the economic agenda that formed in the wake of an economic downturn in the early 1970s—an all-out assault on the policies of the New Deal and the Great Society. Unions were tamed, taxes were slashed, government programs were gutted, government functions were privatized, industries were deregulated, jobs were enthusiastically sent overseas, and finance took up a greater share of our economic activity. Policymakers assured voters that these changes would eventually deliver economic freedom and prosperity to all Americans. But on the whole, this agenda made the wealthy wealthier and more powerful while ordinary working Americans struggled to adjust. The result has been steadily deepening inequality. And few changes were as dramatic or consequential as the fall of the labor movement. From its peak at roughly one-third of the American workforce in the 1940s and 1950s, union membership has declined to about 10 percent of the workforce today, including just 6 percent of the private-sector workforce. According to one estimate, the decline in union membership since 1968 accounts for about 10 percent of the increase in income inequality America has seen since then. According to another, when the impact on the hourly wages of nonunion members is factored in, the decline of unions likely explains as much as one-fifth of the rise in wage inequality among American women and one-third of the rise among American men working in the private sector from 1973 to 2007. Companies are working hard to cripple unions even further. Although the Wagner Act prohibits them from explicitly firing or punishing workers for trying to unionize, U.S. employers spend more than $400 million a year on consultants who specialize in discouraging or thwarting unionization efforts with a variety of tactics that skirt the edges of legality. And even when companies engage in flagrantly illegal activity—firing unionizing workers, say, or spying on employees who are organizing—the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot directly impose monetary penalties on them for breaking the law. That weakness has made employers brazen. In recent years, major firms such as Starbucks, Chipotle, Walmart, and Trader Joe’s have not just fired workers trying to organize but have also shut down entire stores with ongoing union activity, supposedly for unrelated reasons. And as union organizers know well, even when a union is formed, negotiating a labor contract can be a long, drawn-out process, thanks in substantial part to the company’s stalling tactics. This landscape, combined with the growing difficulty of organizing, has taken power away from workers and given an increasing share of it to executives and wealthy investors on Wall Street. In recent years, unions and advocates hoping to wrest that power back have united in support of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act—the most significant piece of proposed legislation for organized labor since the Wagner Act. An override of state right-to-work laws; a ban on forced anti-union meetings at work; a ban on permanently replacing striking workers; a ban on forcing employees to waive their right to class-action lawsuits; civil penalties for violations of the Wagner Act; and a presumption in law that workers are employees rather than independent contractors unless employers can prove otherwise—these and the PRO Act’s other provisions would be utterly transformative, making it easier to organize unions, bolstering their power, and extending new protections to all workers, both union and nonunion. Still, more could be done. Federal labor law could be changed so that a union is automatically formed and recognized by the NLRB once a majority of employees in a given unit sign cards authorizing one—without the need for a separate election. And workers should have the right to bargain over more in union contracts than “wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment,” as the Wagner Act currently allows. Harvard Law’s Sharon Block and Benjamin Sachs have noted that workers have mounted internal protests at a variety of firms recently over issues like climate change and the injustice of Donald Trump’s immigration policies. As they argue, “the democratic principles that give workers a claim to voice over wages and hours similarly demand workers have voice in these other decisions that their firms make and that have profound impacts on the workers and their communities.” What’s more, the Wagner Act has never covered public employees or agricultural and domestic workers. Federal law should grant them the same labor rights as all other workers. It should also end at-will employment by establishing that workers can be fired only for just cause—a reform that would not only grant American workers a basic protection afforded to nearly all other workers in the world, but also facilitate the formation of unions by making it more difficult for employers to invent reasons for firing union organizers and pro-union employees. It should also be established that federal labor law, once reworked, should be the floor for labor protections in this country rather than the ceiling. States and localities should be allowed to pass labor laws of their own, provided they are at least as protective of unions and workers as federal legislation is. While these policies would surely rejuvenate and expand unions, it must be remembered that even at peak membership, the vast majority of American workers have never been represented by a union—thanks, in part, to a system that forces workers to organize themselves piecemeal, individual workplace by individual workplace. To broadly unionize retail workers as a whole, for instance, would require unionizing countless individual workplaces at a multitude of companies across the retail sector—an extraordinarily daunting task. Expanding the reach of union contracts could help here. Unions have at times been able to negotiate master contracts that cover workers at multiple companies. Labor law could be changed to help make those agreements more common—once workers at a few workplaces reach similar contracts, for instance, the law could have those contracts automatically cover other newly organized workers in the same region and sector, without each workplace having to negotiate separate agreements. Policymakers could also more fundamentally transform labor law by instituting sectoral bargaining—a system in which representatives of employers and unions come together to negotiate over and set basic pay and conditions for workers across entire sectors of the economy all at once. On bargaining panels, those representatives might craft and vote on agreements that (for example) set a minimum wage-and-benefits package for all retail workers in a given state or region, rather than waiting for workers to organize unions and negotiate contracts store by store. New union chapters could then focus on negotiating issues specific to each workplace, or try to push for even better pay and conditions than the minimums established by the bargaining panels. Sectoral bargaining has a number of advantages beyond being a quicker and easier way to improve things for workers than depending solely on traditional union organizing. For one thing, companies might be less resistant to improving pay and conditions for workers if all their competitors were made to do the same in a sectoral agreement. (As matters stand now, one reason companies fight hard against unions is that they fear spending more on their workers will put them at a competitive disadvantage against their rivals.) For another thing, sectoral agreements could address the now-common management strategy of “fissuring” workers in contracting arrangements and gig-economy employment by protecting all workers doing the same kind of work. “It matters not whether someone is employed directly, is employed by a subcontractor or by a franchisee, or is an independent contractor,” Block and Sachs explain. “If they work in the sector, they are covered by the sectoral collective bargaining agreement.” But perhaps most important of all, sectoral bargaining panels—each a kind of legislature governing work in a particular sector—would be a remarkable instantiation and expansion of economic democracy. And that would be especially so if all the workers in a sector could elect the union members who represent them on each panel. As dramatically different as sectoral bargaining would be from the status quo, the seeds for it have already been sown. At various points over the last century, the federal government established boards and committees with business and labor representatives to set or advise on wage standards. And in recent years, policymakers in states and cities across the country have established similar “wage” and “workers’ boards” to set or advise on wages and working conditions—such as California’s Fast Food Council or Colorado’s board for direct care workers. Efforts like these should be expanded and made more fully democratic—allowing for the election of worker representatives by workers themselves—on the way to true sectoral bargaining in America. Unions and bargaining are far from the only ways that we might build democratic agency for workers. Here, US policymakers should take a page from Europe—with reforms that would give workers a direct say in business decisions. One such reform would be to have businesses institute work councils—bodies of representatives, elected by workers, that are consulted on working conditions, firings and layoffs, and other matters directly affecting employees’ lives at work. While councils in most countries are merely informed of certain impending decisions, a few countries like Sweden and Germany have given their councils a degree of real authority over working conditions. Contrary to what skeptics might assume about the business sense of granting worker representatives that much power, research has shown that work councils have no impact on a firm’s profitability. If anything, they may increase productivity—perhaps by offering workers forums in which they can discuss and solve problems. That makes work councils a good supplement for traditional unions: They can address new or specific issues in the workplace atop the contracts that unions have already negotiated. They can offer workers a voice in workplaces where a union has yet to be organized. The fear that work councils could be used to manipulate workers—through representatives undermined, selected, or controlled by managers—led to the adoption of provisions in the Wagner Act that essentially banned them in the United States. But those concerns should be allayed by new laws mandating that companies put councils in place when workers themselves demand them, and protecting such assemblies from the interference of bosses (much like the Wagner Act’s protections for those trying to organize unions). Workers should also be given democratic power at much higher echelons of corporate governance. In some countries, companies are required, under an arrangement known as codetermination, to reserve for their workers a portion of the seats on their governing boards, ensuring that ordinary employees get at least some say in decisions that might otherwise be left wholly to executives and investors. Germany’s system is perhaps the most well known and widely studied. There, most companies with 500 to 2,000 employees are required to have their workers elect one-third of the supervisory board that chooses and manages the executives running the company. Most companies with at least 2,000 employees are required to have their workers elect one-half of that board. And, as with work councils, research suggests that firms with codetermination are as or more productive than others. In 2018, Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin introduced a bill that would have required all corporations on the stock market to let workers elect at least one-third of their board of directors. This was followed by presidential-campaign proposals from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Warren would have required companies collecting at least $1 billion in revenue to let workers elect 40 percent of their boards. Sanders would have had all companies on the stock market, as well as companies with at least $100 million in assets or revenue, let their workers elect 45 percent of their board. Either way, the Warren and Sanders proposals would have applied to companies employing roughly 30 million workers. Under the Baldwin, Warren, and Sanders plans, employee power would obviously be limited. As is just about universal in all codetermination schemes, worker representatives would have only a minority of seats on each board. Still, granting workers elected seats at the table where corporate decisions are made would significantly empower them. Even with a minority of seats, worker representatives could deeply influence corporate governance by casting key votes on issues where other board members might be split, and ensuring that matters important to workers are raised for discussion. And they could use that influence to help bolster the democratic power of workers elsewhere—by pushing back against company efforts to discourage or frustrate union organizing, for instance, or by trying to rein in political contributions to anti-union candidates and groups. But even if workers were on their boards, companies would still fundamentally be accountable to those who own them— founders, executives, and anyone else owning company shares. For public companies, that includes Wall Street investors who buy and profit from stock sold in the markets without contributing anything whatsoever to a company’s operations and success. Shareholders can vote on corporate matters— including selecting company board members—and the dividends that boards decide to pay out. A company’s actual employees, on the other hand, are generally entitled to none of this. Unless their employers are generous, they earn nothing more from the wealth their work produces than their pay and benefits—no shares or income as their companies do well, no votes as shareholders. Even with all the reforms explored above, those wealthy or well-placed enough in the company to own stock would still be calling the shots. Given all that, workers should also be owners, entitled to an ownership stake in the companies they work for. Some already are. According to Rutgers professor Joseph Blasi, about 10 to 20 percent of companies on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have substantial programs where some stock is either granted to employees or offered to them at a discount. That includes corporations such as Alphabet (Google), Apple, ExxonMobil, Ford, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft. And at some private companies, employees can come to own a substantial proportion of shares. The supermarket chain Publix, for instance—one of the top 10 largest private US companies—is fully owned by its 250,000 employees and its founder’s family. For years now, the primary vehicle for achieving worker ownership at that scale in the United States has been the employee stock-ownership plan (ESOP). In an ESOP, a company’s stock is gathered from various sources and placed in a trust for employees, who receive an allocation of shares that the company can buy back from them for cash once they retire. About 6,500 companies employing some 14 million workers—about 10 percent of the private-sector workforce—have ESOPs today. Roughly 2,000 of them are wholly owned by their employees. And research suggests that employee ownership is both good for workers and good for business. Companies with ESOPs tend to grow faster and are more productive after starting such plans than they would have been otherwise. Privately held ESOPs are also less likely to go bankrupt, and ESOP workers are less likely to be laid off. While some might assume that companies with ESOPs would compensate for the stock given to employees by reducing wages, evidence shows that the wages of employees at such firms may, if anything, be higher. Gregg Gonsalves Feature / Julian Epp Nevin Kallepalli Sarah Sophie Flicker From a democratic perspective, most ESOPs have one key limitation: Workers usually lack a direct voice in corporate governance as shareholders. Instead, ESOPs are run by trustees, who vote for employees on most matters (except major changes, such as a company’s sale or merger). Yet they can be structured differently. Employees could be allowed to vote directly on more matters, for example, or they could be given the right to control the votes cast by trustees. The tax and other government incentives and supports that flow to ESOPs could be amended specifically to encourage the formation of ESOPs of this kind. In 2019, Bernie Sanders proposed another democratically promising and ambitious model for worker ownership, inspired by an idea floated by the UK’s Labour Party. Under his plan, the federal government would pass a law requiring all companies on the stock market and all companies with at least $100 million in revenue or on their balance sheets to establish what he called Democratic Employee Ownership Funds (DEOFs), controlled by worker-elected trustees. Each company would then gradually place 20 percent of its stock into its DEOF over 10 years. And workers at each company would have the right to vote through their portions of stock in the fund, just like any other shareholders. In plainer terms, the Sanders plan would have given workers ownership and control over 20 percent of every major company in the country—every big corporation you’ve heard of and thousands more besides, employing some 56 million Americans. And their ownership stakes would entitle workers to both full voting rights as shareholders and additional income from dividends worth, according to one analysis, an average of at least $2,622 per worker per year at publicly traded companies. As far-reaching and transformative as Sanders’s own proposal is, evidence suggests there may be public support for taking it even further. In 2019, a survey found that a majority of Americans would support companies with more than 250 employees transferring as much as 50 percent of their stock to worker funds, making them halfway worker-owned and worker-controlled. Beyond ESOPs and the funds envisioned by Sanders, there are fully fledged worker cooperatives—companies directly owned and controlled by their workers. In a cooperative, the divisions between workers and managers are eroded or erased to establish self-government. Collectively, it’s up to the workers in a cooperative to decide what the business should do, and then to do it. The profits, like the employees’ responsibilities, are divvied up among themselves. The worker-cooperative sector in most countries is small. In the United States it is positively tiny—by one estimate, there are perhaps 1,000 such enterprises in America, employing some 10,000 workers. But cooperatives are nonetheless instructive, illustrating how much workers are capable of when left to their own devices—and how well democracy at work can function as a practical matter. Consider Spain’s Mondragon Corporation, perhaps the best-known collection of cooperatives in the world, which employs tens of thousands of workers across some 95 firms in a variety of industries. “The collective enforces five hundred and five types of patents and employs about twenty-four hundred full-time researchers,” New Yorker contributor Nick Romeo wrote in 2022. “The odds are good that key elements of something within a hundred feet of you—an espresso maker, a gas grill, a car—were made at Mondragon.” In general, cooperatives—as large as Mondragon or much smaller—tend to be about as profitable and grow about as much as traditional companies, while offering their workers more job security. They do come with their own unique challenges— worker congresses, like all congresses, do not always work well, and full participation in cooperative governance can demand a lot from workers. But they’re a viable and democratically empowering business model, and we could do more to foster them. States can pass legislation laying out how cooperatives should be incorporated to help them comply with state laws built around more traditional businesses and secure funding from banks. Tax breaks and loans can be offered to help start cooperatives or convert existing businesses into them. And more worker-ownership centers, like those in Sanders’s Vermont, could be founded with government support to offer them resources and technical assistance. Pursuing the agenda described here would remake the American economy once again, this time to the benefit of America’s workers—reducing inequality, improving the conditions of their working lives, and dramatically expanding their democratic agency in ways that will pay off not only at work but within our politics. Empowering workers and the unions advocating on their behalf could hamper the anti-worker political activities of their employers. And putting more money in workers’ pockets could facilitate democratic participation—it’s much harder to be an involved and attentive democratic citizen, after all, if you’re not sure how you’re going to pay your bills next month. But economic democracy would bolster political democracy in another way. Democracy is a vastly complicated thing; like all complicated things, engaging in it well takes practice. Habits and skills, such as learning how to present and debate one’s ideas, when and how to compromise, and how to critically assess and synthesize different sources of information before coming to a decision, are critical for democratic life. Ideally, we’d be better at them than we seem to be today; we might improve if we gave ourselves the chance to work on such skills more often, between and beyond elections. Economic democracy—whether through participating in unions, electing work councils, voting as shareholding workers, or working in full-fledged cooperatives—gives us the opportunity to hone those skills at work, where we come together with people often very different from ourselves to achieve things big and small. Through work, democracy could be made more concrete to those who’ve come to doubt it—understood, materially, as the means by which raises can be won and problems in our daily working lives that trouble us can be solved, rather than as abstractions bandied about by politicians who always seem to promise more than they accomplish. In this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump. We’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel. The Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here? At The Nation, we know which side we’re on.

Thumzup Media to invest $50M into mining as Trump eyes Jerome Powell’s replacement. Thumzup Media, backed by Donald Trump Jr., has raised $50 million to invest in crypto mining and blockchain as Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high. This coincides with President Trump’s latest attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Thumzup Media Corporation, a social media and crypto buying firm linked to Donald Trump Jr., has secured $50 million to push into crypto mining and blockchain bets. The move comes as Bitcoin [BTC] hits a new ATH and President Donald Trump threatens a “major lawsuit” against Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Fresh off a $50 million capital raise through a $10-per-share offering, the firm plans to expand its strategy to include large-scale Bitcoin mining and targeted blockchain investments. Source: thumzupmedia.com Part of the funds will go toward purchasing advanced mining rigs, with talks already underway with technology providers to fast-track deployment. Thumzup, which bought its first Bitcoin in January and now holds 19.1 BTC, joins a growing list of public companies treating crypto as a strategic asset. Donald Trump Jr. owns 350,000 shares in the company. Building on Thumzup’s bullish timing, Bitcoin surged past $123,231 on the 13th of August, a fresh all-time high on Coinbase. The milestone came alongside a record-setting S&P 500, as softer-than-expected inflation data caused optimism in risk markets. July’s CPI held steady at 2.7% year-over-year – below forecasts – while monthly price growth slowed, strengthening bets on a September rate cut. The CME FedWatch tool now pegs those odds at nearly 96%. Source: cmegroup.com Looser monetary policy and an end to quantitative tightening have so far supported Bitcoin’s momentum. Investors also see effects from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill making way for more crypto gains. As Bitcoin’s rally unfolds, the political spotlight is also on the Federal Reserve. President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Jerome Powell, calling him “Too Late” and claiming “the damage” as “incalculable.” He blasted a $3 billion Fed building project as “a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!” Source: Truth Social Meanwhile, the administration is vetting 11 potential successors for when Powell’s term ends in May. New names in the mix include Jefferies strategist David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey, and BlackRock CIO Rick Rieder. They join a roster of seasoned monetary policy hands. Officials have described the process as “deliberative.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to interview all contenders before narrowing the field for Trump’s decision.

Title: AI Is A Money Trap
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

Title: AI Is A Money Trap
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

Title: AI Is A Money Trap

Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

Title: Our corporate leadership class

Some readers may disagree, but I get the sense that corporations, especially large bureaucratic ones, foster leaders who do not possess strong opinions about anything. The leaders that do emerge seem to be pliant creatures who practice a repugnant form of leadership through consensus, continually testing the waters to determine the least offensive position that they might take for the moment. Granted, there are exceptions to this rule like Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, who Trump tapped for Energy Secretary, and even Elon Musk, who despite his dumb-headed notion of an E.V. future for all has strong opinions about where things should head. Why are there so many servile nullities pervading our corporate leadership class? The most prominent case in point, are the CEOs of the oil majors. They spend half their time walking around with their head down and the other half apologizing for the perceived ills their product may have inflicted upon society. I was recently struck by the following passage from an article in The Economist: That includes the oil-and-gas industry, which is struggling to find a way to decarbonise profitably. Murray Auchincloss, bp’s boss, announced a shift away from renewable energy and back to fossil fuels in a ‘fundamental reset’ earlier this year. On July 22nd news broke that Shell, Enbridge and Aker bp, three oil companies, had quit the SBTi’s advisory group set up to define what ‘net zero’ means for oil companies. They are said to have left because they were told achieving it would mean not developing new oil- and gas-fields. For those that have not read The Economist, this is standard fare from a magazine that whole-heartedly embraces the platform of the World Economic Forum. However, my point is that the passage unwittingly reflects poorly on the forward-thinking ability of the CEOs of the three oil companies. They join an advisory group set up to define what “net zero” means for oil companies, only to be told later that achieving it would mean not developing new oil and gas fields. In the words of Homer Simpson, “D’oh!” What explains such cluelessness? One explanation might be the degree to which they are beholden to institutional investors. CEOs cravenly seek the approval of institutional investors who have the power to sink their stock price by selling a large number of shares if they don’t like what they see or hear coming from a CEO. As a class, institutional investors are even worse than CEOs. They are conditioned to rationalize anything. They embrace new (corporate) fashions as enthusiastically as any New York City socialite shopping at Bergdorf Goodman. In the same article referenced earlier, another passage gives one a feel for the mindset of institutional investors: Financial institutions are also backsliding. Along with hsbc, big American banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have dropped out of the nzba [Net-Zero Banking Alliance], as have some from Japan and Canada. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think-tank, estimates that the leavers account for two-fifths of the group’s total assets. The same problems are afflicting similar organisations, such as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. This year Wells Fargo, another American bank, scrapped some of its emissions-reduction plans and in March Switzerland’s ubs pushed back its climate targets after acquiring Credit Suisse. Part of the problem for financial institutions is politics, which was shifting even before Donald Trump returned to the White House. In America Republican senators have suggested that joining a green alliance could breach antitrust rules. Since Mr. Trump’s re-election the pressure has been cranked up. In January ten state attorneys-general wrote to America’s biggest financial firms, including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, threatening legal action if the companies did not change their climate and diversity policies. What can we infer from the passage about institutional investors? It is not a flattering picture. After years of burdening corporate leaders with having to reach arbitrary net zero metrics, institutional investors are scrapping it as they sense that the public is not buying into the woke agenda. It is a sad indictment of corporate America that CEOs are so cringingly servile and institutional investors so vacuous. Image generated by AI.

Title: Bitcoin hits new all-time high as Fed easing bets and favorable US policy align
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-as-fed-easing-bets-and-favorable-us-policy-align/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T02:29:53Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin blasted through to a new all-time high on Thursday, as a perfect storm of roaring optimism over Federal Reserve policy and a series of powerful pro-crypto reforms converged to send the digital asset into uncharted territory. The move signals a dramatic new phase for a market that has been supercharged by a seismic shift in the US political and regulatory landscape. In early Asian trading, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed as much as 0.9% to touch $124,002.49, decisively surpassing the previous peak it set in July. The tidal wave of buying lifted the broader market, with the second−largest token, Ether, surging to 4,780.04—its highest level since the bull market of late 2021. This record-setting rally isn’t a random surge; it’s being powered by a clear confluence of forces. According to IG market analyst Tony Sycamore, Bitcoin’s momentum is a direct result of “increasing certainty of Fed rate cuts, sustained institutional buying and moves by the Trump administration to ease investment in crypto assets.” The technical picture is now just as bullish, with Sycamore noting that a decisive move could open the floodgates for a much larger run. “Technically a sustained break above $125k could propel BTC to $150,000,” he wrote in a note. Since President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the regulatory environment in the United States has transformed from hostile to overtly favorable. Trump has proudly labeled himself the “crypto president,” and a series of long-sought regulatory wins for the industry have followed throughout 2025, from the passage of landmark stablecoin regulations to a broader overhaul by the securities regulator to accommodate digital assets. The market impact of this policy pivot has been staggering. Bitcoin itself has risen nearly 32% so far in 2025. More broadly, the entire crypto sector’s market capitalization has ballooned from about $2.5 trillion in November 2024, when Trump won the election, to over $4.18 trillion today, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The latest and perhaps most significant tailwind came from an executive order signed last week on Thursday. The order paved the way for crypto assets to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, a move that could unlock a colossal new wave of mainstream capital for the asset class. This is not just a win for investors; it’s a potential boon for asset management giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, whose crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could become staples of American retirement planning. However, this push into long-term savings is not without its perils. The very volatility that creates spectacular rallies also poses significant risks, especially for retirement accounts that have historically relied on the relative stability of stocks and bonds. For now, though, the market is firmly focused on the upside, celebrating a new era of legitimacy that has sent its leading asset to heights once thought unreachable.

Title: Is AI a job killer or creator? There's a third option: Startup rocket fuel
URL: https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-ai-a-job-killer-or-creator-theres-a-third-option-startup-rocket-fuel/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T02:00:00Z
Full Content:
Study computer science or related aspects of information technology, get a job at Chipotle? Artificial intelligence appears to be subsuming many coding and technology jobs, according to a recent gloomy article by The New York Times' Natasha Singer. "The spread of AI programming tools, which can quickly generate thousands of lines of computer code -- combined with layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft -- is dimming prospects in a field that tech leaders promoted for years as a golden career ticket," Singer wrote. Also: Want a job in tech? You need these skills, McKinsey study shows There are three ways of looking at AI in terms of career prospects. One is the job-killer, noted above. Another is to immerse oneself in AI development and oversight skills, which are in demand. Then there's a third option. AI may be the lever that lifts professionals' paths into the startup space, opening up abundant opportunities. Ultimately, it may help people more successfully launch and guide their startups. "AI makes it easier for founders to launch new enterprises, said Spiros Margaris, a leading global venture capitalist in the fintech space and founder of Margaris Ventures. Margaris shared his perspectives on startup opportunities with us. "With the right large language models and data skills on your team, you can automate a significant portion of your operations, test ideas faster, spend less, and reach profitability sooner, if customers like what you're offering." Also: Can you build a billion-dollar business with only AI agents (yet)? This author thinks so AI could help wring out some of the risk that accompanies launching one's own venture -- the fear factor that stops people in their tracks from leaving the formal job market. Almost half of the one million startups started annually within the US will fail within the first five years, according to tracking data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Eventually, up to 90% will fail, due to competition, misguided product strategies, or overwhelming costs. AI's greatest advantage for testing new business ideas is speed. "What used to take months or years can now be prototyped and tested in weeks," Margaris said. "Just as we saw with fintech democratizing the financial industry, we're seeing the same with AI. It allows smaller players to level the playing field against large corporations by providing capabilities that previously required deep pockets, investments that only large corporations could afford. Now, thanks to AI innovations, these capabilities are accessible with far fewer resources." At this point, AI should be at the core of most, if not all, startups, he added. "Many startups were already using AI in some form before ChatGPT changed the game. Even those not using it yet are figuring out how to integrate it into their strategy. If you want to survive, grow, and raise money, becoming AI-first isn't optional anymore." Also: A year after Altman said superintelligence was imminent, GPT-5 is all we get? AI is being leveraged everywhere in today's startup scene. "Fraud detection, marketing, e-commerce, hiring, coding, you name it," said Margaris. "Machine learning was already in play before OpenAI reset our expectations of what's possible. Look at Meta's recent numbers: No matter how massive AI spending seems, it's only going up, and the payoff is coming faster than most industry observers thought possible. As AI advances its capabilities, startups will continue finding innovative ways to use the technology to their benefit and ultimately ours." There are even observers who say it's possible for an individual -- or very small team -- to build a billion-dollar business with now widely available AI tools. At the same time, AI adds more complexity to startup scenarios, said Margaris. "AI isn't a free lunch, even if it feels magical when it works. It can reduce risk, help with compliance, and improve auditability, but it can also create new headaches. It's two sides of the same coin." He added that cybersecurity also needs to be at the forefront of new ventures. "The threats are getting sharper as AI is used both to defend and attack. That's a fight every startup must be ready for, and it will only become more complex with issues like intellectual property disputes and data privacy regulations." Also: The AI complexity paradox: More productivity, more responsibilities Margaris has advice for those wishing to start a new business and how AI can help. "Build a team that understands AI, data science, governance, and ethics. Never lose sight of the AI regulatory environment, which could have a profoundly negative impact on your business if you don't monitor it closely." Importantly, "tools don't win; people do," he said. "A great driver will beat a good one in the same car. It's the same with AI. The right team and mindset make all the difference. My advice? Dive in and start experimenting now. If you hesitate, your competitors won't and they'll capture your market before you've even started."

Business FILE PHOTO: Sparks strike representation of cryptocurrency Bitcoin in this illustration taken November 24, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo TOKYO :Bitcoin hit a record high on Thursday as increasing expectations for easier monetary policy from the Federal Reserve added to tailwinds from recently announced financial reforms. The world's largest crypto-asset by market capitalisation climbed as much as 0.9 per cent to $124,002.49 in early Asia trading, surpassing its previous peak hit in July. On the day, the second largest crypto-token ether hit $4,780.04, the highest level since late 2021. Bitcoin's rally is being powered by increasing certainty of Fed rate cuts, sustained institutional buying and moves by the Trump administration to ease investment in crypto assets, said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore. "Technically a sustained break above $125k could propel BTC to $150,000," he wrote in a note.

Title: Mayor Adams vetoes bills boosting NYC grocery delivery worker wages after lobbying by Amazon, Instacart
URL: https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/adams-vetos-bills-boosting-nyc-grocery-delivery-worker-wages-after-lobbying-by-amazon-instacart-mastro/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T00:21:00Z
Full Content:
Mayor Adams vetoed two City Council bills late Wednesday that would boost minimum wages for grocery delivery workers to more than $20 an hour — a move that came after his top aide, Randy Mastro, launched an internal advocacy effort against the measures, according to sources familiar with the matter. The mayor, whose own Department of Consumer and Worker Protection commissioner lauded the bills as recently as late last year, had until midnight Wednesday to veto the measures or they would have lapsed into law. With just over six hours to go until the deadline, Adams announced he had used his veto pen to block both bills, arguing they would result in higher grocery prices — an issue that has become a big focus on this year’s mayoral campaign trail. In a statement, Adams argued the increased wage requirements would result in grocery delivery companies jacking up prices on their customers, which he said includes seniors, people with disabilities and SNAP beneficiaries. “Grocery prices are already too high, so now is not the right time to do anything to drive these prices even higher. Unfortunately, Intro. 1135-A and Intro. 1133-A would do just that at a time when too many working-class New Yorkers are struggling,” the mayor’s statement said, using the index numbers for the measures. Sources familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Daily News that Adams has in recent weeks been advised by Mastro, his first deputy mayor, to use his veto pen to block the bills. The sources said Diane Savino, a senior adviser to Adams at City Hall, has also been involved in the talks with Mastro and the mayor. The internal convos came after Amazon and Instacart, two major grocery delivery companies, launched an aggressive lobbying campaign urging Adams to block the bills. Targeting officials in Adams’ office and at the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Amazon and Instacart have made the same argument that the measures would result in higher grocery prices for their customers and also warned of potential layoffs of delivery workers. “We thank Mayor Adams for recognizing this reality,” Tom McNeil, Instacart’s senior government affairs manager, said after his vetoes. Council Democrats passed the two bills with veto-proof majorities, meaning they could move to override the mayor’s attempt to block them. Julia Agos, a spokeswoman for Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, said after the vetoes that the chamber’s Dems are “considering our next steps” and “will always stand up for workers in our city.” Agos also accused the mayor of “parroting inaccurate talking points” about increased grocery costs. Supporters of the bills have argued third-party delivery platforms would face increased costs, not grocery stores. “This veto demonstrates that the mayor’s claims to care about working-class New Yorkers and a sustainable delivery industry for New York City are hollow, because he is undermining the workers who make the sector possible,” Agos said. “Without fair wages and protections for delivery workers, there is no sustainable industry, just exploitation.” One of the two bills, Introduction 1135, would over time require third-party companies like Instacart to pay grocery delivery workers a minimum wage of $21.44. That level matches the minimum wage the city set for restaurant delivery workers earlier this year — a reform that the mayor supported. The second bill, Introduction 1133, would ensure that any companies with “contracted” workers performing delivery services are protected by the same wage requirements. The 1133 bill was specifically designed to ensure Amazon would be covered by the new wage rules. Amazon owns WholeFoods, the grocery store chain, so their delivery workers could be defined as closer than third-parties, leading the Council to enact the second bill to plug any potential loophole. The vetoes come after a December 2024 Council hearing, in which Adams’ Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga, whose agency oversees wage laws for delivery employees, said she wanted to “enthusiastically commend” the Council for advancing the bills. “There are many more New York City delivery workers in need of DCWP protections,” she testified. Adams spokesman Zachary Nosanchuk said the administration’s views have changed since the December testimony as grocery prices have continued to increase. Grocery prices, and cost-of-living concerns more broadly, have been hotly debated during this year’s mayoral race. Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic mayoral nominee who’s polling as the favorite to replace Adams, has vowed to if elected open city government-run grocery stores to try to bring down costs of essentials. In a press conference before the mayor’s vetoes, Mamdani said he hoped he wouln’t try to block the bills. “I think it goes against what so many New Yorkers are calling for, which is a wage they can actually live off of,” he told reporters. To date, the Council has overridden Adams three times on legislative vetoes, including when he tried to block a bill placing new transparency requirements on NYPD officers. The Council is gearing up to override yet another veto Adams issued earlier this month to kill a bill decriminalizing unlicensed street vending. Mastro’s involvement in pushing the mayor to veto the grocery delivery bills comes as he has become known at City Hall for his aggressive management style. Since becoming Adams’ top deputy this spring, Mastro has pushed to reverse several Adams administration initiatives, including a plan to build affordable housing in Manhattan’s Elizabeth Street Garden as well as a new composting fine structure on landlords.

Nothing screams bull market more than an influx of institutional investors and a growing risk appetite from traditional enterprises in crypto assets and the crypto market. We are now seeing this phenomenon play out in real time in the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, such as Ethereum. The second-largest altcoin by market cap has increased by 17% in the past week and is now edging ever so closer to breaching the psychological $5000 barrier for the first time. While this is obviously bullish for Ethereum, it also spells good news for other altcoins in the market, as some of this liquidity and capital are bound to flow into the most hyped tokens at some point as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Analysts believe these three tokens, ENA, ETHFI, and RTX, could benefit from this liquidity spread as the bull market intensifies. There has been a phenomenal increase in the Ethereum price over the past week, with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap surging by 17%. This is thanks to an influx of liquidity in the token and its various crypto investment products, such as Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts estimate that around $1 billion in liquidity has gone into Ethereum in the past week as investor confidence increases as the bull market intensifies. This means several things. One is that Ethereum could finally breach past the psychological $5000 barrier for the first time since it launched in 2015. It also means that ETH-based tokens could enjoy a price surge shortly, as some of the Ethereum liquidity trickles down into other assets as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Analysts have tipped ENA and ETHFI as possible winners from the scenario, but they’ve also tipped their weight behind RTX, an upcoming native token in the fast-growing PayFi scene. Crypto analysts are throwing all their weight behind Remittix, an upcoming PayFi project with impressive fundamentals, as the bull market intensifies. With the recent Ethereum price boost, analysts believe Remittix’s native token, RTX, could benefit massively from the trickle-down liquidity, causing a price spike when it eventually launches. Remittix has caught the eye of the crypto industry recently, thanks to its impressive and innovative features, most of which are expected to transform the global payments experience.

[Update - 8/14/25] - NVIDIA's Rubin architecture and respective GPUs remain on track as part of the company's annual cadence. [Original Post / Debunked] NVIDIA's next-gen Rubin lineup might be delayed by at least a few months, as Team Green is redesigning the lineup to give AMD a tougher competition. The next-gen AI hardware segment is expected to see many changes in terms of the shift in market share from NVIDIA to AMD. Both firms are battling fiercely to bring superior equipment out there; however, NVIDIA seems to see the competition ramping up unexpectedly, which is why the firm is looking for a Rubin redesign. Based on a report by the Fubon Research, which is part of one of the largest banks in Taiwan, it is claimed that Rubin will have limited volume in 2026, marking a delay of approximately four to six months. 1) Rubin redesign leads to more limited volume2) TSMC CoWoS capacity to hit 130k in 20273) Blackwell Volume: 750k in Q1 25, 1.2mn in Q2, 1.5mn in Q3, 1.6mn in Q44) Broadcom is fastest growing CoWoS customer in 2026Source: Fubon$tsm $nvda $avgo pic.twitter.com/ckoZswOCkI While the specifics of a redesign are uncertain for now, NVIDIA's decision is reportedly based on AMD's Instinct MI450 AI lineup. The latter is claimed to debut with IF64 and IF128 configurations, competing with Vera Rubin. More importantly, AMD is claimed to go heavy on HBM capacity, reportedly featuring up to 432 GB per GPU. Hence, NVIDIA might target newer Rubin configurations, but this is just an estimate for now. Moreover, AMD relies on design modularity through the use of Infinity Fabric over Ethernet, which allows for easier rack deployment. It is claimed that the Rubin redesign will limit the shipment volume of the next-gen architecture in 2026, similar to what is happening now with Blackwell Ultra. Eventually, that timeline would be right in time for MI450 to debut in the market, which means Rubin Ultra might get pushed ahead as well. While the reason for Rubin's delay isn't specific, our estimate does indicate that NVIDIA's vigorous product cycle might have caused issues for the firm, and we have discussed this aspect in depth here.

August 13, 2025 16:31 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Compare the top multichannel marketplaces behind fast-growing brands

WooHoo10 Added by @adrianlabosch The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog August 13, 2025 Selling on an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce gives you the greatest amount of control over your own online store, marketing, and product positioning. But can you do more to increase your global reach and engage with new shoppers who wouldn’t have any other way to find your products? Yes, and selling products on multiple marketplaces, in addition to your ecommerce store, is the answer. These channels give you access to existing audiences so you can reach more customers in more places. The top multichannel marketplaces reach a wide range of people across the globe. Let’s go over some popular picks to understand how they can help you scale. You’re probably familiar with many of the best online marketplaces for multichannel selling — like Amazon and eBay. But there are several others with a comparable reach like Walmart, Etsy, and social media marketplaces such as TikTok Shop. There are also platforms that have a broad reach within a specific region, like OnBuy and Kogan. Here are some things to consider when choosing the right marketplaces for your business: Remember that you don’t have to commit to just one of these online sales channels. You can sell on multiple channels or give an online marketplace a trial run before migrating all of your products. Let’s take a closer look at the top multichannel marketplaces: Amazon has come a long way from its early days as an online bookseller. It’s now about as close as you can get to an everything-seller as it expands with brands like Whole Foods Market. Most of Amazon’s products come from other marketplace sellers, including ecommerce businesses that want to expand their reach to new audiences. Amazon’s long history gives it the advantage of time-tested features like Amazon Prime, its membership program for frequent customers. Some of the key advantages of selling on Amazon include: As an Amazon seller, you can also sign up for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to have Amazon handle the shipping process for you. With FBA, you can offer two-day Amazon Prime shipping, which adds legitimacy to your products through Amazon’s implied endorsement. Selling products on Amazon comes with a few selling fees, depending on how you use the marketplace. Every seller pays them: Additional fees may apply for refunds, high-volume product listings, and services like FBA. This marketplace has a wide appeal and reach due to its broad global availability. Amazon ships to numerous countries through its AmazonGlobal program. When you partner with Amazon through FBA, your products become eligible for AmazonGlobal, helping you reach customers all over the world. And if you choose to serve the United States as part of those countries, you’ll enjoy the benefits of selling products through a reputable brand. Clarify Capital’s study on consumer trust found that people across generations considered Amazon their most trusted retail brand in 2023. Once you set up your account with Amazon, your team can integrate it with your WooCommerce store to manage your Amazon listings alongside your WooCommerce listings. Install the Amazon for WooCommerce extension to get started. eBay began as a place to sell used items through bidding competitions. Now, merchants can also sell new items through fixed price product listings, making it a great option for large and medium-sized online businesses. However, eBay is still most likely the best match for you if you sell pre-owned or refurbished items. Since eBay has been around for such a long time, it benefits from a more loyal group of buyers than something like Amazon. eBay itself notes that it has a base of “enthusiast buyers” who spend thousands of dollars a year on the marketplace. eBay is a true marketplace. It sells no products of its own, so your only competition comes from other sellers, not the parent company. Key advantages of selling on eBay include: Sellers on eBay pay two types of selling fees: If you choose to buy an annual eBay Store subscription, the cost is: These plans progressively offer more free listings and lower selling fees, allowing you to scale your eBay store alongside your business. According to eBay, its most dedicated online shoppers fall into four categories: Since eBay emphasizes that the second and third types of buyers drive the most growth, you’re likely better off sticking to a niche or using eBay’s tools to offer great deals. Sync your eBay and WooCommerce stores with the eBay Integration for WooCommerce extension. Walmart began as a brick-and-mortar retailer, not an ecommerce marketplace. But once it started selling online, Walmart quickly ramped up to compete against the biggest names. Walmart integrates marketplace products into its regular listings, so when someone searches for something on Walmart, marketplace items appear alongside products from Walmart. This can add both credibility and visibility to your catalog. Walmart Marketplace offers standard features like customer reviews, alongside more unique options, like: WFS works very much like Fulfillment by Amazon. You send your products to Walmart’s multiple warehouses. Then, when orders are placed, they pack and ship your products for you. Joining WFS also gives you the option to offer two-day shipping. A stricter qualification process is a good reason to consider Walmart, too. It only accepts sellers with a record of previous ecommerce success. This policy ensures that all its sellers are reputable, with quality offerings. Unlike Amazon or eBay, Walmart charges no fees for setup, listings, or subscriptions. It instead charges a fee per sale, which varies by product category. The range goes from 5% to 20%, but the majority of product fees are either 8% or 15%. Additional selling fees apply for those using WFS. WFS charges for each unit shipped, based on weight. Walmart Marketplace sellers benefit from Walmart’s reach as a major retailer in North America. According to Walmart’s research on the Marketplace audience, more than half of Americans who shop on Walmart.com buy from the marketplace. These customers shop in the following product categories most frequently: Shoppers on Walmart Marketplace also value low prices. Walmart’s research shows that 82% of these customers consider price an important factor in their Marketplace purchases. You’ll have the best luck with this channel if you sell lower-priced goods over luxury items. As a WooCommerce user, you can manage your Walmart product listings in your dashboard with the right extension for your region. American businesses can use the Walmart Integration for WooCommerce extension, while Canadian stores can use the Walmart Canada Integration extension. Etsy began as a platform for people to sell unique, handcrafted items, rather than mass-produced products. And for the most part, it retains that mission. For online sellers, Etsy is the place to sell one-of-a-kind items. Regardless of Etsy’s start as a place for individual artisans, medium-sized businesses and enterprises can also use its services if they fit into the right product categories. If you primarily sell craft supplies or vintage items, Etsy will help you find your people. And if those products are a subset of your inventory, you can sell them on Etsy and mention your WooCommerce store in accordance with Etsy policies. Etsy has some features similar to other platforms, such as apps, seller support, and the ability to customize your Etsy shop. In addition, Etsy’s seller benefits include: Rather than a monthly subscription, Etsy charges the following listing and transaction fees: Some stores may also need to pay a $15 one-time setup fee. Etsy’s audience is very distinct from the other top marketplaces online because it focuses on three product categories: handmade goods, vintage items, and craft supplies. This niche focus means that Etsy shoppers are either looking for items they can’t find anywhere else or hoping to make their own unique creations. It’s a treasure hunt for the right find for a vintage collection or craft project. Unlike the last three marketplaces you learned about, Etsy serves a very specific audience, so some stores will find it to be an incredible opportunity to spur growth. WooCommerce also integrates with Etsy to make your life easier as an ecommerce seller. Add the Etsy for WooCommerce extension to get started. In recent years, social media giants like Meta and TikTok introduced in-platform stores like the Facebook Shop and TikTok Shop. These marketplaces work a little differently than the ones discussed so far. They connect directly to your social media profiles to create a seamless shopping experience for your followers. This makes them ideal if you have a particularly strong audience on social. Meta shops and TikTok Shop offer different experiences. While Facebook and Instagram focus mainly on your posts and profile, TikTok Shop also has a dedicated marketplace where users can search based on products and categories similar to other top marketplaces. Facebook and Instagram shops act like an extension of your current profiles. You can: Interactions with your store happen between followers and your profile rather than through a separate marketplace. In other words, Meta shops act like a proxy rather than an entirely different channel. Meanwhile, the TikTok Store offers similar features to Meta stores as well as a marketplace where customers can browse items independent of profiles. Sellers can also appear in TikTok’s Shop tab and join the Shop Mall program for extra visibility. TikTok users can search for the products they want in the Shop tab and see relevant listings regardless of the profiles they follow. Meta and TikTok also have different pricing models due to the nature of each platform. While you can use Facebook and Instagram shops for free, TikTok does charge seller fees. Currently, sellers who opt to direct customers to Instagram or Facebook’s checkout have to pay a payment processing fee of 2.9-3.49%. However, Meta plans on sunsetting in-platform checkout, so both shops will soon have no fees. Meanwhile, in exchange for its more robust features, TikTok charges the following fees for each sale: Just as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have different audiences, each store has a distinct audience as well. All three have a vast number of users, so it’s a matter of finding the right fit for your market. Here’s a general breakdown of each user base: Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok all have WooCommerce extensions to help you handle multichannel selling. Check out the Facebook for WooCommerce, Instagram Sync for WooCommerce, and TikTok for WooCommerce extensions. Marketplaces tailored to certain regions, such as OnBuy and Kogan, are perfect for geographic-based targeting. Medium-sized businesses and enterprises alike can tap into the potential of regional marketplaces if they have a good grasp on where their shoppers live. Otherwise, you may be better off sticking with more global platforms. The top feature of a regional marketplace isn’t something you’d list on a spec sheet. Instead, it’s the ability to attract people from the regions you serve. While features can vary, the best marketplaces do tend to offer standard features, such as order management and inventory tracking. Just like global brands, regional platforms take a variety of approaches to pricing. For example, OnBuy uses a plan-based pricing model without listing fees. Read a marketplace’s selling fees page carefully before you sign up. The reach of each regional marketplace varies. For example, Alibaba targets the entire Chinese ecommerce market, as well as other countries across Asia, while Kogan is specific to Australia and New Zealand. Check your ecommerce platform’s analytics to see where your shoppers come from and how much they overlap with a marketplace’s audience. WooCommerce provides extensions for two regional marketplaces — OnBuy and Kogan. Other platforms may offer their own integrations, or you can hire a developer to create a connection using the REST API. Since selling on popular marketplaces involves multiple channels, it requires a slightly different approach than using your ecommerce platform alone. Follow these tips to maximize your success: Most top marketplaces have a search function that is similar to those of major search engines. In order to provide the most relevant results, it attempts to match a customer’s search terms with the information included in listings. That means that your listings should include the words and phrases shoppers might use to find your products. That said, make sure to check your platform’s seller guides for any marketplace-specific tips. You can also use the basics of search engine optimization as a starting point. Most top marketplaces also offer ads and boosted listings that you can use for more visibility. Before getting started, find out the following about your specific platform: Many of the top marketplaces integrate with WooCommerce, allowing for: WooCommerce has a variety of extensions you can use to link your marketplace channels with your main store. You can do this by following these steps: With WooCommerce, you can scale your store across multiple sales channels. So, whether you want to add one marketplace at a time or jump in with several, WooCommerce has the features to support you. Add extensions as you need them to keep everything up to date and provide the best customer experience possible.With all that potential at your fingertips, what are you waiting for?

Title: Crypto Platform Bullish Shares Debut Above $100, More Than Doubling IPO Price

Shares of crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) soared as high as $102 in initial trades on Wednesday, their first day of action on the New York Stock Exchange before closing at $68. The company priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $37 per share, above the expected $32 to $33 range. That price valued the Cayman Island-based crypto exchange at a total market value of $5.4 billion. Bullish, which is the owner of CoinDesk, earlier this week expanded the amount of shares it sold in its IPO to 20.3 million as investor appetite turned out to be larger than anticipated. Both BlackRock and Ark Investment Management had expressed interest to buy up to $200 million worth of shares. “The last leg of growth in crypto in the last 10 years was basically all retail and if you look now, the institutional wave has begun, it’s here, it’s a question of how big it will be,” Bullish CEO Tom Farley said in an interview with CNBC. Unlike retail-focused exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, Bullish targets institutional investors seeking exposure to digital assets while relying on the oversight and safeguards of a centralized platform. The exchange saw trading volume of over $1.25 trillion as of March 31, since its launch in 2021, according to a filing. “Bullish's $1.1 billion IPO raise reflects growing institutional confidence in the crypto exchange sector, driven by a favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration and Bitcoin's surge past $100,000,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. “This success, alongside Circle's strong IPO performance, signals that institutional investors are increasingly viewing centralized exchanges as viable long-term investments. However, sustained confidence will depend on regulatory clarity and market stability,” he said. The company’s debut comes at a time of booming interest in crypto-related projects, specifically from Wall Street, as U.S. regulators are getting close to a regulatory framework for the space, allowing participants to engage in a safe way.

Title: ‘Well worth viewing’: Perseid meteor shower to continue Wednesday night

One of the most eagerly awaited astronomical events of the year – which promised one or two meteors or “shooting stars” a minute – is set to continue in Irish skies on Wednesday night. Tuesday night saw about 60 meteors an hour darting across the sky and stargazers can expect about half that amount on Wednesday night. “The Perseids will be half as strong tonight as they were last night, so that’s still 10 times more meteors tonight than a normal night, so well worth viewing,” said David Moore from astronomy.ie. “The best time to view is dusk until dawn,” he said. “We had people sending us counts of how many they saw every 15 minutes from 10:30pm last night when it got dark enough to see them. I saw some after 4am when dawn was breaking.” “Dublin gets much the same view as the rest of the country, indeed, all of Europe,” Mr Moore said. “This year the moon is in the sky so even those in the countryside will have moonlit skies so even suburban viewers will get the same view.” Met Éireann has forecast a humid night with clear spells on Wednesday, however a few showers are possible which could be heavy or thundery. Mr Moore advised stargazers to ensure they are comfortable while looking up. “Standing with your neck craned back for hours is not comfortable. “Look anywhere in the sky. If there are clouds look in the clear patches. If totally clear stand with your back to the moon so it does not dazzle you,” he said. “The paths of the meteors will all point back to the constellation Perseus but you do not have to look at Perseus.” The Perseid meteors are caused by dust particles shed by the comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun, was last seen in Irish skies in 1992. At this time of year, Earth moves through this debris cloud, making one of the most celebrated astronomical events and arguably the most predictable. Particles from the debris cloud subsequently burn up on entering Earth’s atmosphere and create flashes of light. The shower is active for several weeks. “It’s such a special time of the year,” said astronomer Danielle Wilcox from Blackrock Castle Observatory, Cork. “It’s a really good meteor shower in particular because it gives us a lot of meteors per hour compared to other meteor showers,” she said. “That’s what’s so exciting about it, especially for people who have never seen ‘shooting stars’, this is your chance to get out there and see that,” she said. “Take some time to look up,” she said.

Title: Applebee’s and IHOP’s CIO places AI bets that can boost traffic and improve the dining experience
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/13/applebees-and-ihops-cio-places-ai-bets-that-can-boost-traffic-and-improve-the-dining-experience/
Time Published: 2025-08-13T16:06:47Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Justin Skelton, the chief information officer at Dine Brands, envisions a world in the not-too-distant future where an IHOP server can scan a QR code and pull up every detail about a guest’s order preferences and history. Using generative AI to guide them, servers can then suggest the perfect side dishes to complement that order of pancakes and sausage. This AI-powered “recommendation engine,” which utilizes Google Cloud’s recommendations AI technology, is already in production for online orders at the restaurant operator’s IHOP and Applebee’s chains and will also roll out soon at Dine’s Fuzzy’s Taco Shop. It blends together a guest’s past order history with the buying patterns from a broader pool of similar diners to generate more personalized menu pairings. But there could be even greater opportunities for targeted, in-person upselling when the technology could be deployed across the chain’s 3,5000 brick-and-mortar restaurants. “There’s a lot of new technologies we’re looking at that we want to bring to the market,” says Skelton, who has served as CIO at Dine since 2019, after prior technology leadership roles at CVS Health, Bank of America, and Allstate. Skelton says that all of his generative AI bets are intended to support three outcomes: boost revenue and traffic, improve the guest experience, and bolster worker productivity. Because he runs a small IT team, Skelton says he has to be very careful about his technology bets. “We’re not prepared to go and invest in and hire a lot of people,” says Skelton. With that in mind, Dine tends to partner and “buy” more solutions from vendors rather than build. Skelton relies on large AI companies like Google and Amazon and non-hyperscalers like IT consulting firm Cognizant. The latter helped Dine create and launch an AI Innovation Foundry last fall, a virtual lab that is led by Skelton’s IT team and works with different stakeholder groups including legal and finance to test emerging AI technologies. Initially only available for corporate employees, the Foundry became so appetizing that franchise partners have also been encouraged to submit use cases for Dine’s team to vet. “There’s a recognition that not all ideas are going to make it and see the light of day,” says Skelton. “It’s really sort of a way we can incubate.” With budget planning for 2026 already under way, Skelton and his team will mull the proposed use cases and a steering committee will determine the few select projects that will get capital allocation. Some newer concepts that Dine is considering include AI-enabled tools that can make it easier for the general manager to understand their staffing levels, inventory, and other data needed to make a restaurant run smoothly and utilize that real-time data to make better decisions. Another is an evolution of Dine’s generative AI assistant tool that guides the company’s franchise technology services team, a group of technicians that resolves issues like when a printer breaks or a point of sale system is down at a restaurant. In the future, Dine hopes to make this a self-service tool, allowing franchisees to access Dine’s technician data to solve some of their own problems. Investments in AI to improve back office functions, demand forecasting, and predicting the appropriate staffing level for any given day are all efforts that can bolster the bottom line. That’s especially critical in the restaurant industry, which operates on notoriously thin margins. For customer-facing applications of AI, many restaurant chains have prioritized AI-enabled recommendation tools that are flourishing online. Chains like Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s have all deployed or tested AI-enabled drive-thru technologies to varying degrees of success. There is also a fine line that casual-dining chains like Dine must balance when adding technology—a playbook that differs from fast-food operators like McDonald’s and Burger King. At those chains, guests often prioritize the speed of service, which has fueled the popularity of ordering kiosks in recent years. But at Applebee’s or IHOP, diners crave a more personal connection. “There’s still that human touch and that human interaction that cannot be replaced with technology,” says Skelton. “But it can be enhanced, without a question, and we’ve got to figure out how to get that right.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. The AI talent war continues to intensify. A lot of new media reports have homed in on the aggressively expensive AI talent war, including a piece from The Wall Street Journal that cites research showing that Anthropic’s retention rate is higher than rivals OpenAI, Meta, and Google. The Financial Times reports that Apple has been losing AI staff to rivals throughout the year while Business Insider says that Elon Musk’s xAI has hired 14 AI researchers and engineers from Meta since January. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, commenting on the marketplace in a recent interview with CNBC, says this is “the most intense talent market I have seen in my career.” He adds that the compensation packages will be especially intense for “a very small number of people right now.” The New York Times reports that pay packages for the most elite talent is rivaling that of NBA stars like LeBron James and Steph Curry.

Last week, OpenAI launched a new version of its flagship product, GPT-5, which the company says delivers “more accurate answers than any previous reasoning model,” and is less prone to hallucinations than previous models, has better coding functionality, scores higher to offer medical health advice, and integrates with Gmail and Google Calendar for agentic capabilities. But the product's "real-time model router"—which automatically decides which one of GPT-5’s several variants is best suited for each particular job—sparked a user backlash. While the router was designed to save users from the hassle of manually pickings models, many users bristled at the lack of control. Still, as Fortune's Sharon Goldman reports, these model routers may be the future of AI. Nvidia, AMD strike deal for export licenses in China. American chip makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD is the sponsor of this newsletter) have agreed to pay 15% of their revenue from Chinese AI chip sales to the U.S. government, an unusual arrangement that Bloomberg reports may set a new precedent for U.S. companies that seek to do business in China. Nvidia announced its plans to share 15% of the revenue of the company’s H20 AI accelerator in China, according to President Donald Trump in a briefing with reporters on Monday, while AMD’s deal was reported by Bloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter. Separately on the chips front, Trump last week demanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, following a request from Republican Sen. Tom Cotton for more information about Tan’s ties to Chinese companies. After Tan met with Trump on Monday though, the POTUS said he would be spending more time working things out with Tan, whose career he pronounced an "amazing story." Nearly half of developers don’t trust the accuracy of AI tools. An international survey of over 49,000 developers found that a lack of trust is growing in AI tools even as the use of these tools proliferates in the development process. 46% of developers say they don’t trust the accuracy of the output of AI tools, a big increase from 31% in last year’s survey, which was conducted by developer question-and-answer website Stack Overflow. Other notable nuggets from the study include that a majority of developers still aren’t using AI agents (only 31% are doing so). The large language models that are used by most developers are OpenAI’s GPT models (81%), Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet models (43%), and Google’s Gemini Flash models (35%). When it comes to technologists and their evolving approach to work, 66% of developers say they spent time in the last year learning new coding techniques or a new programming language and 44% have turned to AI tools to learn how to code, up from 37% last year. But “vibe coding,” a buzzy new practice of writing code with AI using natural language prompts, still isn’t embraced by most. Nearly 77% say they aren’t vibe coding for their professional work.

Rupee weakens against dollar due to crude oil prices, dollar demand, and foreign fund outflows, closing at 87.57. Indian equity markets ended the last trading session before Independence Day holiday with modest gains, demonstrating resilience amidst mixed global cues and pre-holiday caution. The BSE Sensex closed up 110 points (0.14%) at 80,649 while the NSE Nifty 50 gained 30 points (0.12%) to settle at 24,649, marking the second consecutive day of positive closing and successfully breaking a six-week losing streak. The market’s positive momentum was primarily driven by a historic sovereign rating upgrade by S&P Global, which raised India’s long-term credit rating to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB-’ with a stable outlook. This significant upgrade, citing India’s robust economic growth, sustained fiscal consolidation, and policy stability, provided substantial confidence boost to investor sentiment. S&P projected that India’s real GDP growth would average 6.8% annually over the next three years, reinforcing the country’s economic resilience. Technology stocks emerged as the standout performers, with the Nifty IT index surging 1.7% as global tech optimism spilled over into domestic markets. This was owing to strong performances from Infosys, Tech Mahindra, and Bajaj Finserv, each rising up to 3%. The wholesale inflation data also provided support, with July WPI falling to -0.58% compared to -0.13% in June, indicating continued disinflation trends. Domestic institutional investor support remained unwavering, with DIIs maintaining their buying streak and purchasing equities worth ₹5,624 crore on August 13, effectively offsetting the FII selling of ₹3,644 crore. This marked the 28th consecutive session of DII buying, demonstrating the strength of domestic liquidity in stabilizing markets against foreign outflows. Mangal Electrical Industries IPO opens on August 20, aims to raise Rs 400 crore for expansion and debt repayment. “India just upgraded by S&P to BBB with Stable Outlook. Government Bond market rallying on this news as this would encourage more foreign and FPI inflows into the bond markets. A higher Credit Rating systematically gets more investments into the country as risk-adjusted returns are better. We see India to remain in global spotlight for Emerging Market favourable asset allocation and bond yields to fall in the short term.” Brigade Hotel Ventures Limited (BHVL), second largest owner of chain-affiliated hotels and rooms in South India among major private hotel asset owners as of March 31, 2025, today announced the signing of a landmark multi-deal agreement with Marriott International, Inc. to develop six hotels (940 rooms) across four key markets in the country.

The easing of Wholesale inflation to 0.58% is better than expectations and reflects the resilience of the Indian economy. The sustained deflationary trend, which reached a 25-month low, aligns well with the moderation of retail inflation to an 8-year low, with both trajectories heavily influenced by the softening of food prices. Inflation is within the RBI’s tolerance band, and moving forward, global economic headwinds may pose a hurdle to keeping the figures rangebound. There is a possibility of a slightly rough patch in the coming quarter due to the Tariffs levied by the US. However, given the robust domestic consumption trend, we foresee this pattern to be a sustained one, irrespective of external factors. Backed by a good monsoon favouring agricultural activities, we are likely to see a strong trend with further scope for softening of core inflation as well as headline inflation Dilip Pattanayak, President & Group Chief Human Resource Officer, JSW Steel, who tendered his resignation on May 20, 2025, due to personal reasons and to pursue career opportunities outside the JSW group, will be relieved from service with effect from August 18, 2025 Mrs. Bectors Food Specialities posts consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 2025 at ₹30.9 crore, as against ₹35.4 crore in the same previous quarter.

The stock of Aster DM Healthcare has been in an uptrend since March. It was triggered by the support at ₹400. But over the past month, the scrip has been charting a sideways trend between ₹574 and ₹610. On Wednesday, the resistance at ₹610 was breached. This has opened the door for further appreciation. The chart indicates a potential rally to ₹680 in the near term. That said, before this upswing, the price might moderate to ₹590. Aster DM Healthcare stock shows uptrend potential with resistance at ₹610 breached, signaling rally to ₹680, with risk management strategies. Global satellite operators, including Intelsat, Inmarsat, Singapore Telecom, KT SAT, IPSTAR, and PT Telekomunikasi, are targeting India’s $2.3 billion satellite communication (satcom) market, projected to grow to $20 billion by 2028. These companies are increasing satellite capacity and forming partnerships to resell capacity for broadband-from-space services, aiming to compete with Elon Musk’s Starlink, which has 7,578 satellites. Starlink, Reliance Jio-SES JV, and Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb have approvals to operate in India, while Amazon’s Kuiper and Globalstar await permits. The market’s growth is driven by direct-to-cell communication, enabling satellite signals to connect directly to mobile phones, and rising demand for connectivity in underserved regions. Tata Group’s Nelco has partnered with Eutelsat OneWeb and added Koreasat-7 for Ku-band operations. Intelsat, acquired by SES, added satellites for C-band services, while Viasat, which owns Inmarsat, is expanding its presence. India’s supportive policies, like GMPCS licensing, and rapid digitalization fuel this surge, positioning India as a key hub for satcom innovation. Broadband services are expected to launch later this year, pending spectrum allocation. Starlink could attract 180,000 subscribers initially, scaling to 5.7 million by 2030, but faces competition from local and global players. Regulatory challenges, like data localization, persist, though recent approvals signal government support. India’s satcom rollout is poised to be the world’s fastest, driven by private investment and government initiatives. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will implement a new cheque clearance system starting October 4, 2025, reducing clearance time from up to two working days to a few hours. The Cheque Truncation System (CTS) will transition from batch processing to continuous clearing with “on-realisation-settlement” in two phases: 🔸Phase 1 (October 4, 2025 - January 2, 2026): Cheques will be scanned and processed continuously during business hours (10:00 AM to 4:00 PM). Drawee banks must confirm cheque status (positive or negative) by 7:00 PM, or the cheque is deemed approved for settlement. 🔸Phase 2 (from January 3, 2026): The confirmation window shortens to three hours from presentation. For example, cheques presented between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM must be confirmed by 2:00 PM, or they are deemed approved. Settlements occur hourly from 11:00 AM. Payments will be released to customers within one hour of settlement, subject to safeguards. Banks are directed to inform customers and prepare for the transition. This aims to enhance efficiency, reduce settlement risks, and improve customer experience. 11:30 U.K. GDP m/m (Expected: 0.2% versus Previous: -0.1%) 12:00 India WPI Inflation YoY (Expected: -0.30% versus Previous -0.13%) 18:00 U.S. PPI m/m (Expected: 0.2% versus Previous: 0.0%) 18:00 U.S. Unemployment Claims (Expected: 225k versus Previous: 226k) Economic Calendar - 15.08.2023 India, South Korea and Italy @ Market Holiday 07:30 CHINA Industrial Production y/y (Expected: 6.0% vs Previous 6.8%) 07:30 CHINA Retail Sales y/y (Expected: 4.6% vs Previous 4.8%) 18:00 U.S. Retail Sales m/m (Expected: 0.6% vs Previous 0.6%) 18:45 U.S. Industrial Production m/m (Expected: 0.0% versus Previous: 0.3%) 19:30 U.S. Prelim UoM Consumer Sentiment (Expected: 61.9 versus Previous: 61.7) Deere & Company (Pre market) (Sector- Capital Goods) NetEase, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- Technology) JD. com, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- Retail) Tapestry, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- Retailer) Amcor plc (Pre market) (Sector- Packaging) Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- Technology) Applied Materials, Inc (Post Market) (Sector- Technology) Nu Holdings Ltd (Post Market) (Sector- Financial) Credicorp Ltd (Post Market) (Sector- Financial) Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (TENT) (Sector- Energy) Centrais Electricas Brasileiras S.A. – Eletrobras (TENT) (Sector- Power) YPF Sociedad Anonima (TENT) (Sector- Energy) Major U.S. listed stocks result calendar 15.08.2025 Flowers Foods, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- FMCG) 3BBLACKBIO, AGARIND, AGIIL, AHLUCONT, ALGOQUANT, ALKYLAMINE, ANDREWYU, ARE&M, ARIHANT,ASHOKLEY, ASTRAZEN, BCG, BLKASHYAP, BLUECLOUDS, BOROLTD, CITURGIA, CROPSTER, DBREALTY, EASEMYTRIP, ETHOSLTD, EXPLEOSOL, FISCHER, GEPIL,GLENMARK,GREENPOWER, HEMIPROP, HINDCOPPER, HINDOILEXP,IDEA, INDORAMA, INOXGREEN, INOXWIND,IOC, IRB, JAICORPLTD, JAMNAAUTO, JINDALPOLY, JINDWORLD, JPASSOCIAT, JSLL, JTEKTINDIA, JYOTISTRUC, KDDL, KERNEX,KHAZANCHI, KMEW, KOTIC, LAOPALA, LLOYDSENT, MIIL, MUFIN, NAVA, NFL, OPTIEMUS, PANACEABIO, PATANJALI, PLATIND, PROSTARM, REDTAPE, RISHABH, ROTO, RRP, SABTNL, SANSTAR, SASKEN, SEPC, SPAL, SPANDANA, SPECTRUM, SPICELOUNG, SRHHYPOLTD, SRM, SWANENERGY, TCIEXP, TECHNVISN, TIRUMALCHM, VINATIORGA, VOEPL, WALCHANNAG, WCIL, YSL, ZAGGLE ASHOKLEY YoY * Revenue expected at Rs 8726 crore versus Rs 8598 crore * EBITDA expected to be seen at Rs 962 crore versus Rs 910 crore * EBITDA margin expected to be seen at 11.03% versus 10.59% * Net profit expected to be seen at Rs 582 crore versus Rs 525 crore GLENMARK YoY * Revenue expected at Rs 3458 crore versus Rs 3244 crore * EBITDA expected to be seen at Rs 645 crore versus Rs 476 crore * EBITDA margin expected to be seen at 14.68% versus 18.66% * Net profit expected to be seen at Rs 379 crore versus Rs 340 crore IDEA YoY * Revenue expected at Rs 11139 crore versus Rs 10508 crore * EBITDA expected to be seen at Rs 4673 crore versus Rs 4204 crore * EBITDA margin expected to be seen at 41.96% versus 40.01% * Net Loss expected to be seen at Rs 7004 crore versus Rs 6432 crore IOC QoQ * Revenue expected at Rs 180458 crore versus Rs 195270 crore * EBITDA expected to be seen at Rs 15756 crore versus Rs 15029 crore * EBITDA margin expected to be seen at 8.73% versus 7.69% * Net profit expected to be seen at Rs 7997 crore versus Rs 8122 crore 13 August 2025 (Rs.

US stock market rally hits new records as investors bet big on a September Fed rate cut after fresh U.S. inflation data painted a mixed picture. July’s CPI eased to 2.7%, but core inflation rose to 3.1%, sparking hopes of lower borrowing costs without an immediate economic slowdown.

Title: Why the latest inflation data gives investors a reason to smile
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/markets-inflation-cpi-rate-cut-forecast-september-october-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-13T15:01:14Z
Full Content:
Good morning. Ever considered investing in real estate? You might already have a big piece of what you need. "House hacking" is a new strategy homeowners are using to kick-start their rental portfolios. In today's big story, the latest inflation data gave investors a reason to feel upbeat about what's coming next. What's on deck: Markets: Why day traders' summer dominance could be hit with a September chill. Tech: Microsoft is dangling multimillion-dollar offers to poach Meta's AI talent. Business: Taylor Swift used to separate business from her love life. Not anymore. But first, the rally continues. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Not too hot, not too cold — this was just right. The latest inflation report struck a good balance, delivering a best-case scenario for the stock market. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq rose over 1% and the Dow spiked nearly 500 points. US stock futures are continuing the climb this morning. The consumer price index rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, below economists' expectations of 2.8%. The figures may seem marginal, but for markets, this was the sweet spot. That's largely because it was likely low enough to allow the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September meeting, BI's William Edwards writes. At the same time, the inflation reading was high enough to ease recession fears that had flared after the disappointing July jobs report, which included significant downward revisions to previous data. (The report rattled more than just economists — Trump promptly fired Bureau of Labor Statistics director Erika McEntarfer after the data was released.) Meanwhile, the latest inflation report opens up more positive possibilities. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows markets seeing 92% odds the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points next month, up from about 80% on Monday. Higher odds are also now being priced in for cuts in October and December. For Trump, rate cuts can't come soon enough. "Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate. Steve 'Manouychin' really gave me a 'beauty' when he pushed this loser. The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable." Writing in a Truth Social post early Tuesday, Trump said that he is also "considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed" over the "grossly incompetent" job he's done renovating the Federal Reserve. This is the latest twist in Trump's feud with the Fed Chair, which seems to remain in an uncomfortable phase. The markets, at least, may be entering a brighter one. 1. America's biggest bank is about to open its new headquarters. JPMorgan Chase's new 60-story skyscraper at 270 Park Avenue is full of high-end perks and amenities. The building includes a "state-of-the-art" gym — which the bank said employees will have to pay a membership fee to access — an Irish pub, AI tech systems, and more. Take a look. 2. A September showdown may be looming. Day traders outperformed professional money managers this summer, but their dominance might not last long. A historically seasonal pullback in retail trading and other headwinds threaten to upend the summer-long rally. 3. Trump's pick for Bureau of Labor Statistics chief suggested pausing US jobs reports. E.J. Antoni, Trump's nominee and chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, floated the idea on Fox News Digital earlier this month, citing accuracy concerns. Economists and market strategists told BI that such a move would be damaging for investors and economic planners. 1. Microsoft has Meta AI talent in its sights. The software giant has a list of its most-wanted researchers and engineers from Meta and has already begun offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, documents viewed by BI's Ashley Stewart reveal. It's a step to compete with the eye-popping comp Microsoft's rivals are offering in the AI talent wars. 2. AI coding startups have an inference whale problem. Anthropic and Cursor are facing surging costs from a handful of heavy users, which is eating into their business models. As a result, they're introducing tiers or rate limits to what was formerly a basic fixed-price monthly subscription plan. 3. Baconator with a side of AI? Michael Chorey, the executive responsible for building out the AI automation for Wendy's drive-thru, which he says can take orders faster than a human in a headset, is leaving after five years. Chorey exclusively told BI that he is joining Presto, a tech company developing AI-first drive-thrus, which he believes is the next era of fast-food hospitality. 1. To solve the housing crisis, think outside the bounds. Outside the city bounds, that is. Ned Resnikoff argues that connecting cities, towns, and suburbs into large regional governances would make it easier and cheaper to buy a home in the US. Taxes from exclusive enclaves, like Greenwich, Connecticut, or Sausalito, California, would help support nearby cities. 2. Taylor Swift is in her boyfriend era. The pop star hard-launched the title of her newest album, "The Life of a Showgirl," in a teaser clip of her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast. It signals a shift in her marketing strategy, where she's putting her S.O. and her relationship front and center. 3. You've heard of quiet quitting, now get ready for quiet cracking. The latest threat to worker engagement is quiet cracking, in which people show up to work and do their jobs but still feel dissatisfied. Some of the warning signs can look like less extreme symptoms of burnout, EY's chief well-being officer told BI. Harvey Weinstein is sentenced in Manhattan after a jury convicted him on one count of sexual assault in a retrial. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Grace Lett, editor, in New York. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Lisa Ryan, executive editor, in New York.

Title: BlackRock's $2.4 trillion money manager says the market is in the most bullish investing environment ever

For Rick Rieder, the stock market has never looked so good. The chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock says he thinks the market has emerged into the "best investing environment ever," thanks to a cluster of factors that are setting up a bullish backdrop for equities. Rieder's ultra-bullish view isn't shared by all. Concerns about the US economy and the impact of tariffs have caused the percentage of investors who said they were bearish on stocks over the next six months to rise to 43% in the last week, according to the latest AAII Investor Sentiment survey. But for Rieder, who manages $2.4 trillion of client money, the setup right now is ideal. "It doesn't mean necessarily that everything's going up, but there's a couple of things at play that are pretty extraordinary," Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday. Here's what's driving his optimism. The technical backdrop for equities is highly favorable. Investors have around $7 trillion of cash sidelined in money market fund, which some have said could fuel fresh gains for stocks as rates come down in the coming months and that money is deployed into equities. Corporate stock buybacks are also at record highs. That's setting up an excellent supply-demand picture for the market, Rieder said. "Technicals in equities are crazy," Rieder said. "The demand versus supply is pretty extraordinary. " Corporate earnings are still holding up despite pressure from tariffs. Of the the S&P 500 companies that have reported results for the second quarter, 81% have beaten earnings estimates, above the 10-year average, according to the latest update from FactSet. If that proportion of earnings beats holds, it will mark the best earnings season for the benchmark index since 2023, BlackRock said in a recent note. Earnings strength also applies to some of the market's most popular stocks. If you exclude Tesla from the Magnificent Seven, earnings growth among the group of tech stalwarts is growing at a pace of around 54% year-over-year, Rieder said. At that rate, Rieder said Big Tech stocks' high valuations aren't greatly concerning. The Fed has room to start cutting interest rates again in September, and potentially more aggressively than markets expect, Rieder said, pointing to two catalysts in particular: Rieder said he believed it was "a given" that the Fed would issue its next rate cut in September. He also speculated that the central bank had room to lower interest rates a full percentage point from the current levels, which would imply the Fed funds rate target range falling to its lowest level in about three years. Productivity growth could also rise, Rieder said, pointing to advancements in tech, space, data, and spending on AI in particular. "All of these are geared towards higher productivity, operating at a lower cost basis. That's where we're going," Rieder said of recent tech trends. Higher productivity implies steeper economic growth overall, though labor productivity among all workers actually declined over the last year. The total output among all nonfarm workers dropped to around 1.3% year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "I'm sanguine on the economy. I think we're moving generally in the right direction," Rieder later added. Jump to

Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman on zoning, generational inequality, and how to fix the U.S. housing market. Plus: What Trump gets dangerously wrong about World War II. Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Pocket Casts On this episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic’s David Frum opens with reflections on the upcoming 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and what Donald Trump’s recent statements about “Victory Day” reveal about how America is forgetting the meaning of peace, cooperation, and democratic leadership. Then David is joined by Glenn Kelman, the CEO of Redfin, for a candid look at the broken state of the U.S. housing market. Kelman explains why both buyers and sellers are miserable, how pandemic-era mortgage rates have frozen supply, and why the next generation is increasingly stuck, unable to buy, and often unable to move. They discuss zoning reform, immigration, housing deterioration, and why, despite the bleak outlook, Kelman still believes there’s hope for long-term correction—if America can relearn how to build. The following is a transcript of the episode: David Frum: Hello, and welcome back to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest today will be Glenn Kelman, CEO of Redfin, an online real-estate-brokerage service, and our topic will be the state of the U.S. housing market. Before my dialogue with Glenn, I want to offer some thoughts on quite a different subject: the impending 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. On August 15th, 1945, the imperial Japanese government communicated its surrender to the United States and the allies in the Pacific War. That ceremony was formalized with a ceremony in Tokyo Bay on September 2nd, bringing the war to its legal conclusion. The United States and every belligerent in the war have observed many commemorations of this immense event. As the commemorations have extended in time away from the events that they commemorate, a kind of vainglorious note has tended to enter into these commemorations, never more so than in the message President Trump issued on the 80th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe. I quote from his Truth Social account: “Many of our allies and friends are celebrating May 8th as Victory Day, but we did more than any other Country, by far, in producing a victorious result on World War II. I am hereby renaming May 8th as Victory Day for World War II and November 11th as Victory Day for World War I. We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything — That’s because we don’t have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again!” Now, it’s kind of news that the United States never celebrated V-E Day or V-J Day before Donald Trump came along. Of course it did. But it is true that in the past, these celebrations were always muted with a remembrance of the terrible suffering that the wars brought to those who fought them, the terrible damage they did to the world, the terrible unnecessariness of the wars, and the hopes for lasting peace. But as we get more distant, there has been a tendency—and Donald Trump expresses it more than anyone—to think of World War II as a kind of military Super Bowl in which the United States and a bunch of teams competed. The United States won the trophy. They had the biggest point spread. They had the fanciest jerseys, the prettiest cheerleaders, and so yay, us. I think as we approach this anniversary, that way of thinking seems even more unhelpful than at any time in the past. The thing I’d like to commemorate on this 80th anniversary is not the war that ended on August 15th, but the peace that began on August 15th. The long peace in Atlantic and Pacific—nervous intended of its start, overshadowed by the threat of nuclear destruction of the Cold War, but building and growing and enhancing the lives of people whose parents and grandparents had been on both sides of the war. Victors and vanquished, Allies and Axis found a way to come together and to build reconciliation, to build a new kind of world. And American leadership was absolutely crucial to the building of this world—the American leadership in providing aid to the war-ravaged countries of Europe and Asia. The American guarantee of security that was tested in Asia, Korea, and Vietnam, that was tested in Europe and periodic crises over the city of Berlin. That was backed by American strength and power and supported by a growing number of allies, increasingly democratic allies. The triumph of bringing to democracy countries that had been non-democracies during the war, countries like Portugal or South Korea that had been American allies but began not as democracies, but achieved democratic government. All of this, supported and paid for by the mounting prosperity achieved by the free-trade system that was built by American leadership in the world after World War II. And all of these accomplishments are things that have now been put at risk. As they’re put at risk, I think if we remember the end of the war, we need to remember also the beginning of the war. The American role in the years before 1945 was not as magnificent, not as glorious, not as something to be proud of as the American role in the war and afterwards. The war was made inevitable by a lot of bad American decisions in the 1920s and was nearly lost because of even worse American decisions in the 1930s and ’40s. Trade protectionism, isolationism, indifference to the fate of struggling democracies: Those are part of the American story too. And while the heroic achievements of the years after the war—the turn to free trade and collective security—those are receding, the mistakes that brought the war into being, those are being repeated. In 2025, America is less the country it was in 1945 and much more the country it was in 1925 and 1935. It is funny that Donald Trump is taking credit for a victory that was only made necessary because people did the things that were recommended by the presidency of Donald Trump. The greatest accomplishment of the United States in its history was the peace built after 1945. I think that is the thing that together with Japanese, together with Germans, together with all the defeated, together with the British and the French and the Canadians and the Australians and all those who helped to win, we want this war to recede into history. We want only its lessons to remain alive. Its lessons of cooperation, collective security, democracy of trade. If those lessons are at risk, we need to reaffirm them. That’s the message for this day, not boasting. Every time Donald Trump speaks of war, I think of a poem by Rudyard Kipling called “Recessional,” and there’s a line in that poem that haunts me because it seems to describe so well our present situation. Kipling wrote—he was addressing a prayer to the god of armies. He said: “If, drunk with sight of power, we loose wild tongues that have not Thee in awe.” I think the America of Donald Trump is a little drunk with power. And even as that power is waning, it is loosing wilder and wilder tongues than ever. And it’s not keeping in awe this divine spirit, the spirit of justice and reconciliation that is the thing that I will be thinking about on August 15th of 2025. And now my conversation with Glenn Kelman. But first, a quick break. [Music] Frum: Glenn Kelman is the CEO of Redfin, an online home-brokerage service. Prior to joining Redfin, he was a co-founder of Plumtree Software, a publicly traded company that created the enterprise-portal-software market. Glenn was raised in Seattle and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley. Glenn, thank you so much for joining The David Frum Show today. Glenn Kelman: So excited to be here. Thanks for having me, David. Frum: Oh, so, so grateful to you. So let’s just start with the open-end question: What is going on in the housing market? We’ve had a terrible spring. There’s more bad economic news this summer. What’s the state of the housing market? Kelman: Home prices are softening. So for the first time in nearly a decade, home prices seem likely to soften in the second half of the year. Interest rates may go down just because the jobs news was weak, and that would be a welcome respite, but inventory has been very low for a long time. Sales volume has been extremely low, probably 30 percent below historic levels on a per-capita basis. We haven’t seen this sales volume since 1997, when the United States population was about 30 percent smaller. So the market has been moribund, but home prices have held up, and we’re going to see that in the June numbers. But if you look further ahead, 35 percent of listings are staying on the market for more than 90 days. We have many unsold listings right now. It has just gotten hard to sell a house, especially in the Sun Belt, and so that may bring some relief to homebuyers who really need it. The average age of the first-time homebuyer is 38. It used to be 31 just a decade ago. Frum: Well, one of the things that is strange, and you’re sort of anticipating the question is, this is a market that is experienced as a bad market, both by sellers and by buyers. Kelman: Mm-hmm. Frum: And normally, at least one of those two groups is happy. Bad news for sellers, good news for buyers. Bad news for buyers, good news for sellers. Now, they both seem unhappy that the prices are high. Buyers can’t buy, but the buyers aren’t there, so sellers can’t sell. Everybody’s miserable. That doesn’t seem like an equilibrium state. Kelman: No, it isn’t. I think we’re at an inflection point. So mostly people who have had to sell their home have been able to do so quite easily over the past two or three years. So even in the post-pandemic correction, it was fairly straightforward. But now home sellers are struggling, especially people who bought a house during the pandemic. We are talking to them about lowering their price and they can’t, because they’ll be short on their mortgage. Now, we’re not going to have anything like the great financial crisis in 2008, where there was a wave of foreclosures. But for a particular population of folks who did buy during the pandemic, it has suddenly gotten very hard to sell their home and pay off their mortgage. And so right now the market is just teetering in a very unhappy equilibrium. I think that prices will come down, and I’m one of the people who views that as good news. When bread prices come down, when gas prices come down, most Americans view that as cause for celebration. But when home prices go down, about half of us are worried about it and the other half are throwing a party. And really, for the younger generation, we need prices to come down. Frum: Well, is the cause of the misery that the people who bought during the pandemic and a lot of people were buying with money that was almost free? Very, very low interest rates? Kelman: Yeah. Frum: And now it’s five years on and the cheapest money is the five-year interest rate that resets after year five, and those people are now thinking about selling, but they’re selling to people who have to go borrow at real interest rates. And so that’s the mismatch. The secret is one group has a low monthly payment, but wants to sell the house at a high price. The other group has a high monthly payment and cannot possibly meet the price. And that’s the mismatch and that’s why everybody’s miserable. Kelman: That is a huge part of it. So about 75 percent of American homeowners have a mortgage below 5 percent. We’re unlikely to see a rate like that anytime in the foreseeable future, and so those folks create this rate-locked inventory. Many, many people in America—more than half of all Americans—really couldn’t afford to buy their own home at current interest rates. So it’s very common for us to go to a listing consultation with someone who has had another baby or is going through a divorce, had some kind of life event where they need to move, and when they realize what they’re going to be able to afford from the sale of their home, they decide to stay put instead. Frum: Let’s go around the country, and let’s start in what it’s like—what I understand, like what the Dust Bowl was during the Great Depression, Florida is to today’s real-estate market. It is just the endless source of bad news. So tell us the story of Florida, and then let’s go around the rest of the country. Kelman: Well, Florida has all kinds of problems, and some of them are climate change–related because insurance rates are shooting through the roof. So, so many buyers in Florida get a home, get a mortgage, and they think that’s all there is to it, and usually that’s the case. But now there’s a third rail, which is getting insurance, and because there have been so many storms, insurance rates are sky-high. The state has tried to regulate that to some degree, but it’s really a triple whammy. Because home prices have gone up; many people are moving into the state. That has started to slow. Florida has always been a real-estate-driven economy, so the overall economy struggles when real estate struggles like no other state in America, and that just makes it extremely volatile, especially condos in Florida right now. Very hard to sell. So there are places where it’s still easy to sell a home in Florida, but those are getting more scarce, driven by those three factors. Frum: What’s the strongest real-estate market in the country? Kelman: Strongest real-estate market in the country is probably in the Midwest right now. It just saw less volatility than before. So if you went to a place like Austin, Texas, somewhere in the Sun Belt, home prices went up 40 or 50 percent during the pandemic and then came crashing down. But a place like Chicago has been very Midwest and stylish as you would expect Chicago to be, and so that market has been holding up. I think it’s some of the markets where we saw the biggest pandemic highs that we’re now seeing the most volatility. West Coast markets are doing better because there were a bunch of Amazon workers or Google workers who thought they could move to Texas and keep their jobs, and now they’re being called back to the states. And so this exodus that we saw from California and Washington State is now reversing, and that is supporting the market. If I had to say the biggest split in the market right now, condos are just always more volatile than houses. Townhouses are also much more volatile. Those are the first parts of the market to go. Builders are really struggling right now. Yeah, so the incentives that they’re offering the homebuyer usually involve buying down the rate, and then they’re offering 5 or 6 percent to a buyer’s agent, when normally it would be 2 or 3 percent. That’s an incentive that the consumer herself doesn’t see. It’s an indication that home-builder sentiment is very negative. I think it’s been negative for 15 months. They’ve got their own double whammy where consumer demand is softening, but also their labor supply is shrinking. Frum: Well, let’s talk to the generational aspect because that’s probably one of the most socially debilitating. So you said, a decade ago the first-time homebuyer averaged 31 years old. Today, the first-time home—how old, say it again? Kelman: Thirty-eight. Frum: Thirty-eight. So let’s talk to those 29- and 30-year-olds who said, I thought I was one year away from buying a house, and now I discover I’m nearly a decade away. I’d like to have a house when I’m of age to have children. What hope is there for me? What hope is there for them? Kelman: Well, we just need a correction with a correction. So we already talked about this phenomenon where home sales plunged at the end of 2022, but home prices kept increasing, and that was because all this inventory was rate-locked, and now we’re starting to see inventory pile up. It’s getting harder to sell a home. We think prices will go down by at least 1 percent in the second half of the year, and that means that homebuyers may catch a break, but 1 percent probably isn’t enough. The second part of this is that there just has to be a building boom. There’s this big debate on the left about whether or not we should continue with the current policies or be much more permissive about building not just houses, but nuclear power plants and high-speed rail and all sorts of other projects to bring the American economy forward. I will be quite explicit about this. I am a “yes, in my backyard,” YIMBY kind of politician. I really think America has to be good at building houses or the next generation is really gonna be in a pickle. We always talked about “the bad vibes economy,” where Joe Biden wondered, Why are people so down on the economy, especially this younger generation, and it’s just hard to be optimistic about the economy, even when unemployment is low, if you’re living in your parents’ basement. And so I see some hope—Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren, unlikely bedfellows, are now sponsoring a bill to lower housing regulation and to get more homes built. It passed through the banking committee on a unanimous vote. It’s something that I think the president could really get behind. I had hoped when he started his term, that because he’s a builder, he could be the builder in chief or the developer in chief. Mostly he has not addressed this issue. Frum: You believe that Donald Trump is a builder? Kelman: David. Are you trying to get me in trouble? I do not think— Frum: He’s a name licenser. He’s not a builder. When was the last time Donald Trump built anything? Like, 1980? Kelman: I think he has an enthusiasm for construction. Frum: Yes. Yes. Kelman: Regardless of his bona fides— Frum: He draws—those are his favorite doodles. Kelman: Yes. (Laughs.) Frum: He draws skylines. (Laughs.) Kelman: They are his favorite doodles. Frum: And writes his name on— (Laughs.) Kelman: It’s the White House right now. He wants to build another room in the White House. I know it’s going to have this Louis Quatorze kind of vibe, but, nonetheless— Frum: Louis Quatorze at Las Vegas. But okay, we’re not going down the politics path. I just want to hear more hope for the young. Because even if the day of the 2.75 percent mortgage is not returning soon—and that was a trap, by the way. The way you got 2.75 percent was by saying, I’m signing up for five years, and then letting the interest rate reset, which is not advice that anybody should, any young person who doesn’t have a lot of other resources should be following. You want the length of your loan to be the length of time you’re going to own the home. The depression generation knew that. But anyway, 2.75 money, or even 3.25—we’re not going to see that in the mortgage market so soon, even if the overnight rates come down. So, what’s the hope for the young? What’s the hope for the young? Kelman: I think the hope for the young is that mayors have been losing their jobs over housing. If you look in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, there has been so much rage over the high cost of housing that it has really shifted the politics. There have been a bunch of state bills in California that failed five years ago that made it easier to build housing, made it easier to build accessory dwelling units, lifted parking requirements, and other things that dwindled the supply of housing in California. And now that state has gotten religion about trying to get builders back to increase the supply of housing. So I think there’s just a new political movement. It is a bipartisan issue on the left and the right. At the local level, especially, there has just been this religion that we have to make it easier to build houses and increase the supply of homes. We are probably 4 million, 5 million units short of where we need to be, just given the demographics. Frum: Yeah. Well, if we were having this discussion 10 years ago, 2015, what we would’ve said is, The outlook for housing is exciting because the autonomous vehicle is almost here. And when it gets here, people won’t need to have their own individual parking places anymore because these autonomous vehicles will be rolling around the city. It’ll be robot Uber for everybody, at least in any major place that’s got any population density. You’ll press the button for the robot Uber, it’ll be there in eight minutes, and you will not need a parking space and that will cut $40,000 or $50,000 off the price of a condo. What has happened to that hope? Kelman: Mania. So, the classic realtor move when you can’t afford to live in the city is to look in the suburbs and then to look in the exurbs, so people’s commutes just get longer and longer and longer. And at some point the rubber band always breaks, where people just aren’t willing to live in New Jersey and commute into Manhattan. But now because of Zoom and maybe because of autonomous vehicles, at some point we are going to see people who are more tolerant of longer commutes. We have certainly had these conversations with customers and been surprised. There are people living in Sacramento who commute into San Francisco, and that’s because they’re only coming to work a couple of days a week. But it’s also because the cost of housing is just insane in San Francisco. And I think there’s probably a broader trend here, which is that it used to be that the politics of housing were toxic in San Francisco, New York, LA, and Seattle. But if you went to Indiana or Chicago or Florida, there it was still possible to work a middle-class job and get a starter home. So the American dream died in different places at different rates until the pandemic, and then all of a sudden you saw LA’s housing problem come to Indiana, where people showed up with Monopoly money from LA saying, I don’t care if the house is $300,000 or $500,000; it’s easy for me to afford. And so I think now the housing crisis isn’t just a local political issue; it’s a national political issue, and it did, I think, contribute to some of the economic anxiety that was nationwide. Previously, I think you felt like if you were living in San Francisco, your kids had to go to Harvard and then to Yale and major in computer science and get a job at Google and become a VP if they had any hope of buying a house in the same city they were raised in. Now I think that anxiety has spread to other parts of the country, and that’s why I think there’s a broader consensus that we need to do something about housing in America. We need to build more housing. We need to deregulate a little bit. Frum: Well, from your vantage point, as the intermediary between buyers and sellers—if I said, Okay, we got the governors of the states here, with their notepads open, ready to take dictation, what are the top two, three, even four steps you’d recommend to make it easier to buy, build housing, and make housing cheaper? Kelman: Almost all zoning laws. So zoning. Frum: Be specific. What would you change? Kelman: Well—and this is an issue where I think Donald Trump has been on the wrong side of the issue—but some places only allow single-family homes, so they don’t allow density. You can’t build an apartment building. You can’t build a condo building, and that’s because rich people like to have less density, fewer cars on the road. There’s a certain kind of neighborhood that’s a leafy neighborhood. And so in the past you would see Republican homeowners really argue for zoning laws that made it very difficult to build a house. And then on the left, the issue that people really fought for were some kinds of rent controls, which discouraged us from building rental housing. And so the zoning laws that were popular on the right, the rental controls that were popular on the left—both of those need to go. We’ve already talked about the parking minimums, but mostly it’s just the approval times. So if you talk to builders, they will say that it’s just so much easier to build a house in Arizona than it is in California even though the housing shortage is so much more severe in California. And if you look at what drove California’s boom, Orange County used to be orange groves, and then the city made some unholy alliance with the builder to turn the whole thing into a suburb, and they built houses faster than at any point in America. And I just think, we may not need that rate, but we need something like it if we are to give hope to a new generation of Americans. My broader argument is that I think this will be good, not just for housing, but I do think we need to upgrade the American economy so that it’s ready for the 21st century. And if we are going to do that, we need to start saying yes to solar and wind and nuclear power, to high-speed rail, and all sorts of other projects. Liberal cities are going to fail if they can’t get stuff done. And the sharp end of that spear has been this YIMBY movement. This “yes, in my backyard” movement. So I think that’s the hope for progressive politics. Frum: I think one of the things that people often lose sight of—we talk about housing building. People don’t understand that houses fall apart. We lose housing every year, a certain percentage. It’s a physical asset; it deteriorates over time. And so the idea that—and this is the thing that I think the rent controls understand—that the housing is dropping out of the market all the time because it’s aged; it’s dilapidated. And you either need to tear it down and build something new or you need to invest, in order to upgrade it. But in either case, you don’t just build once and then forget. And the owner isn’t just clipping coupons. The owner is having to, if you want to maintain that unit, actively reinvest all the time to maintain its quality. And so it’s not just build and forget. One of the reasons that you could be able to say, Well, we don’t have a lot of natural population growth. Immigration is slowing down; why 4 or 5 million units? You see this in big cities. A lot of things are just dropping out of the market. The building falls down. There’s a number—I’m going to forget what it is—of the number of apartments in New York that are rent-stabilized and vacant. The building is beneath the city’s code, and so it’s not allowed to be inhabited, but the landlord can’t afford to renovate it because it’s rent stable, and that’s tens of thousands of units in the city of New York. Now, not everybody has crazy rent-stabilization schemes, but everybody has the problem of housing deterioration, which is not something that I think that a lot of people in the YIMBY argument world—the YIMBY people might get it—but not everyone understands. Or remembers, I should say. People understand it once you explain it. Kelman: One thing that people forget about home-price corrections is that it’s not just that the same asset is selling for less money because of the laws of supply and demand; that happens, but if you looked in past corrections like 2008, 2009, and actually walked through the houses, you would see that they were run-down, that nobody had lived in them for six or 12 months, that there had been a foreclosure. So the actual quality of these housing assets across America declined even as the price for the same house also declined. So there were two factors that drove this wealth destruction during the last major price correction, which was in the great financial crisis. And so now, if you look at what the mayor of Detroit has been talking about, there are taxes for investors who own blighted properties. It’s sort of a use-it-or-lose-it tax—that you have to invest to make the property really livable or you have to sell it because there’s sort of a vacant-property tax that’s quite punitive. Frum: And so that forces turnover in the marketplace. Kelman: Yeah. And I think there’s a broader issue here. Of course I’m an advocate for turnover in the marketplace because we’re a brokerage and we make money every time there’s a trade, but to me it’s bigger than that. What has made the American experiment so dynamic is this idea that when Flint, Michigan, goes through a downturn because we’re just not making as many cars as we used to in America, people eventually move. That is the story of the Okies going to California in a John Steinbeck novel. But if you look at the likelihood that an American will live and die in the same town in which he was born, that has actually increased. Frum: My Atlantic colleague Yoni Appelbaum has a very important book about this called Stuck. Kelman: Yeah. Frum: I think the figure that Yoni cites is—now, we’re an older country than we used to be, on average, so you’d expect a little less movement. If you adjust for age, if you look at people in the equivalent age group, an American is about—if I remember Yoni’s book correctly—about half as likely to move at their peak moving years than a comparable American was in the 1980s. We’re not talking about pioneer days, we’re talking about the 1980s, when there were personal computers and airbags in cars and— Kelman: (Laughs.) It’s not so long ago! We were both alive then. Frum: A lot of channels on TV. Disco was dead already. (Laughs.) And in the 1980s, Americans at the peak years of moving were twice as likely to move as Americans—and housing prices have to be a huge part because once you get a house, you think, and especially when you move from a depressed area to a thriving area, that the housing hit that you have to take to move from Flint to wherever the jobs are today is so terrible that people say, Well, here in Flint I may not have a job; at least I have a roof. Kelman: Yeah, and here’s where I really will be teaching my book. Redfin exists to lower the fees paid to a real-estate agent. If you couple the fees paid to an agent with the lender fees and the title and escrow fees, it’s about half of your down payment, and so there’s this conventional wisdom that you need to live at a house for seven years before you offset those fees and get the appreciation necessary to make it a profitable decision to own a home. And those fees should be half of what they are. If you look at what it costs to trade a stock or what it costs to trade almost any other asset, all markets have become more liquid except the real-estate market. And real-estate liquidity is more important to American society because it determines where we live, where we send our kids to school, who our neighbors are. The demographics of the country are really stuck. Frum: There is a lot of inefficiency in the housing market. And that can be fixed by technology and transparency. Kelman: I think so. It’s been a slow road to make real estate more efficient, because it’s a cooperative industry. So what that means is that you have one agent representing the seller and another agent representing the buyer. And if you were to replace one of those real-estate agents with some kind of chatbot, I think the other would take offense. And so nobody wants a disruptive real-estate agent, because you worry that somehow you’ll lose access to the club, and it still is a club that’s running the U.S. housing market, that gates access to the most exclusive listings in the best neighborhoods. And so I think people are very risk averse. Homebuyers are very risk averse about working with different types of real-estate agents. And I am not one who thinks that the real-estate agent will be automated out of existence—I tried to do that when I first got into this business—but I do think that technology can make the process much more efficient. Redfin has proved that in part. We charge half the fee. Our agents are three times more productive, but we still only have about 1 percent market share, and that’s because people are skittish—skittish about working with a different kind of real-estate agent. Frum: Yeah. As we wind this up, I want to deal with an argument that you hear a lot if you like the work of Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein. You’ve seen them caught up to this argument with people who want to personalize the problems in the real-estate market and say, The problem here is not zoning laws. The problem is not interest rates. The problem is that builders are greedy. They’re wicked people, and they’re colluding in wicked ways to make housing less available to others. And this is ultimately a cause for moral reform rather than technical reform. I’ve put that in a kind of unsympathetic way because it’s pretty obvious I don’t think much of the argument, but let’s hear from someone who’s there and knows. Is there any possible truth to the argument that what is going on here is some kind of conspiracy by home builders to oppress America? Kelman: (Laughs.) I don’t think so. I mean, I’ve been to home-builder conferences and it’s a bunch of guys wearing cowboy boots. Most of them are Republicans. But they are trying to make money, and the way that they make money is by building more houses, and they are very much in favor of trying to build as many houses as they can. So I think there’s some hostility to rent controls because it makes it harder to build properties for rent. But mostly these are people who are very pro-immigration. These are people who are very pro-housing. They got their clock cleaned in 2007 because they were building a massive number of units at very low price points with very skinny margins. And you just have to have a little bit of sympathy for them. They’re making a bet 18 to 36 months in advance of the demand. They have to buy the land; they have to get all the materials; they have to get the labor and build the house—and to stick their neck out that far, they have to believe that they’re going to be able to get the project done. And so when they encounter political resistance to that, they simply build somewhere else. That’s why there’s been so much construction in Florida and Texas and less in some progressive states. And so I do think, you know, the Derek Thompson, Ezra Klein argument that we should judge liberal governance by its ability to actually get things done and the simplest way to lower housing prices is to bring those builders back—there’s no conspiracy here. They’re just trying to figure out where they can build properties. Frum: Let me finish by asking you a little bit about change in the—if we think of the house as a technology, it’s an especially conservative technology. Human life changes rapidly, but people still want dining rooms or think they do, even though they don’t eat in dining rooms anymore. They want a lawn, even as it becomes ever more unaffordable and difficult to maintain and even as they move to climates where lawns don’t make sense. A lawn in Arizona—tough problem. We talked about the possible elimination—of how the autonomous car might liberate us from the need to have a parking spot for every high-rise unit. If there are autonomous cars and you don’t need to own your own car, you don’t need the parking spot. Are there other places where the technology of the house, as we know it, could change? I mean, do you put any stock on this idea that young people might be attracted to a kind of, like, clubhouse living where you own your bedroom, you own your bathroom, but you don’t necessarily own your kitchen or your public spaces? Do any of those technologies hold promise or do you think that’s a lot of lifestyle-section talk that people—in the end, people want the house that they grew up in? Kelman: I do think it’s a bunch of baloney. You hear about it every once in a while, and I’m just too old, David. I think that people say that they’re open to all sorts of alternative living arrangements, and then they have a couple of kids and they want the same thing that everybody else does. So the change in the floor plan that we’ve seen has been the second master bedroom because so many people now have their parents helping them raise their kids, helping them buy the house. There’s a lot of nepo homebuyers where the parents kicked in half the down payment and they just have an extra bedroom because they spend months of the year with that family helping to raise the kids. So that’s maybe the only major change in the floor plan. And then the change in the process is, you should just remember that as we talk about how to bring manufacturing back to America, there is one asset that has to be manufactured in America. It’s 20 percent of GDP, and it is the house. There are different parties that have tried to do more of the construction in a factory where the house is built in one place and then shipped very short distances because the shipping is so expensive. But the cost of construction and the speed of construction come down. It’s using lasers and all sorts of other computer data and engineering techniques to build actually higher-quality housing, where it’s just to a higher degree of precision. There’s just so much that we could do if we just made it easier to build houses. I think we could lower the cost. And, of course, the offset on that has just been the labor. It is a real issue that many of the people who build houses in America come from south of the border. And I have wondered—because the new immigration policies—if we are going to see, especially as we talk about AI and worry that men, especially, can’t find the kinds of jobs we had 50 years ago, if more traditional Americans, nonimmigrant Americans are going to move into the construction industry. But that is going to be an issue. We’ll see how it goes. Frum: Is there an immediate effect of immigration pending that rotation of the labor market? There are sections of the house-building process that, as I read it, are more immigrant driven than others. Like, roofers are more likely to be immigrants, especially illegal immigrants. Drywalling is very much an—and part of that, it should be said and to understand here what’s going on, the dangerousness of the roofing job, which is one of the most dangerous jobs in America. And so that tends to be that—and this is where there is maybe a moral story—that you can invest in making the roofing process safer, or you can hire somebody who, if injured, has no right to complain. And a lot of builders are attracted to option B. And by the way, a lot of buyers are voting with their dollars to tell the builder, Don’t invest in the cost of making the roofing process safer. Just hire someone who can’t complain if he’s hurt. Kelman: Yeah, well, I hope that isn’t the only solution. I don’t know that it’s just danger or even low wages or the willingness to do hard work. There are also craft-level jobs that have been staffed by immigrants—so people who make cabinets, people who do electricity. Americans aren’t going into trades at the levels that they once did, and I think we should just account, at least for a moment, for the impact that tariffs have on housing. It’s not just lumber; it’s appliances. It’s a wide range of goods that are imported from outside the country to build the house. And so it’s just a tough time to be a builder right now because there’s so much volatility in the economy and these people are making long-term bets where they buy land years ahead of actually trying to get a sale. And so if your whole supply chain and your labor market have been disrupted, it’s just harder and harder to make that bet. Frum: Okay. Here’s where I want to end. I want you to think about someone who’s 28, 30, 31, who’s confident that they’re going to keep their job for a little while so they don’t have the immediate fear, I’m going to lose my job, which many people have right now. But let’s say you don’t have that fear, but they don’t own a home. What’s the outlook for them? Can you say something hopeful to them about their path ahead? And any advice for them about where they should be looking? Kelman: My hope is that for the first time since 2012, home prices are coming down, and I think that trend is going to continue into 2026. And so maybe time is on your side. It also seems likely that rates are going to come down, at least somewhat. And so I don’t think there’s going to be some revolution that lets you buy a home for half the cost in three years. But I do think that after years and years of home prices going up, at least since 2012, homebuyers are going to get a break. And I’m really glad that you are. Frum: Thank you. Thanks for talking to us, Glenn. We’re so grateful to you for your candor and your time. Kelman: Yeah, David, it’s good to see you.

August 13, 2025 09:49 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

August 13, 2025 09:30 ET | Source: Themes ETF Trust Themes ETF Trust *The Fund has characteristics unlike many other traditional investment products and may not be suitable for all investors. For more information regarding whether an investment in the Fund is right for you, please see the prospectus for more information. **An investor who buys Fund shares after the start of an Outcome Period or who sells shares before the end of an Outcome Period may not fully realize the Accelerated Return and may be exposed to greater losses than that of the Underlying Stock. An investment in the Fund is appropriate only for investors willing to bear those losses. GREENWICH, Conn., Aug. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leverage Shares by Themes is excited to announce the launch of a new category of single stock leveraged ETFs called the Capped Accelerated series, available for trading starting August 13, 2025. These products are designed to equip investors to amplify up to 200% of the monthly returns of the underlying stock up to a cap, while limiting downside risk to approximately 100% of the underlying stock’s returns. The new ETFs use an options-based strategy to increase return potential for the calendar month period, while limiting the downside to the actual movement of the underlying stock. Simply put: Tailored to target a 200% exposure to the monthly performance of their underlying stocks up to a stated cap and reset on the calendar month, this new series aims to offer sophisticated traders and the retail investors an efficient tool to capitalize on potential amplified returns to upside, without increasing the downside risk if the stock prices move lower. The five new ETFS will be set at a management fee of .75%. The new ETFs are: “The biggest criticism from skeptics regarding Single Stock Leveraged ETFs is that they can potentially be too risky for retail traders who don’t incorporate proper risk management,” said Chief Revenue Officer of Themes ETFs Paul Marino. “We believe this new Capped Accelerated series finally offers investors the potential for amplified returns up, without amplifying losses on the downside.” As part of the Leverage Shares by Themes offering, this new series targets prominent companies at the forefront of AI, digital assets and technological transformation: COIO: This ETF tracks Coinbase (COIN), a leading US-based crypto exchange. As crypto adoption grows and regulatory clarity improves, Coinbase remains a critical on-ramp to the digital asset economy. MSOO: Offering monthly leveraged exposure to MicroStrategy (MSTR), this ETF taps into the dual narrative of enterprise intelligence and Bitcoin accumulation. As one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy offers a hybrid play on business analytics and digital asset appreciation. NVDO: Nvidia (NVDA) sits at the heart of exponential tech growth. With Nvidia powering the infrastructure behind AI, gaming, and data centers, this ETF provides leveraged exposure to a titan behind next-gen computing. PLOO: This ETF targets Palantir (PLTR), a software company pioneering the use of AI and big data analytics in government and commercial sectors. With growing demand for its AI Platform (AIP), Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on data-driven transformation across industries. TSLO: As Tesla (TSLA) expands its influence across EVs, battery storage, and AI-drive automation, investors can use this ETF to target amplified performance of a global leader redefining global transportation and energy systems.

Funds listed above (each, a “Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”) seek to provide the following pre-determined outcomes (the “Outcomes”) for an investment that is held for an entire Outcome Period: (1) the Accelerated Return, which is based on the upside share price return of an underlying security (the “Underlying Stock”) and is subject to the Approximate Cap, and (2) approximately the same downside performance of the Underlying Stock. Please see below for the definitions of key terms. The Fund seeks to provide certain pre-determined outcomes (the “Outcomes”) based on the performance of the share price of the underlying stock for investors who hold Fund shares over a full calendar month (the “Outcome Period”). The Outcomes sought by the Fund are: The Funds have characteristics unlike many investment products and may not be appropriate for all investors. The Outcomes sought by the Funds’ strategies are not guaranteed. The Accelerated Return and the Approximate Cap may not operate as anticipated, and investors may lose some or all of their money. The Outcomes apply only to shares that are held for an entire Outcome Period. An investor who buys Fund shares after the start of an Outcome Period or who sells shares before the end of an Outcome Period may not fully realize the Accelerated Return and may be exposed to greater losses than that of the Underlying Stock. An investment in the Fund is appropriate only for investors willing to bear those losses. The Fund does not provide a buffer against losses experienced by the Underlying Stock. An investment in the Fund is appropriate only for investors willing to bear those losses. The Approximate Cap is provided prior to taking into account any fees or expenses charged to the Fund or shareholder transaction fees. Fees and any expenses will reduce the Approximate Cap amount for Fund shareholders for an Outcome Period. The Approximate Cap will likely change for each Outcome Period and will be announced at the start of each Outcome Period. Visit the Fund’s page on leverageshares.com/us/ for information about the start date and end date of the current Outcome Period, the Approximate Cap for the current Outcome Period and the potential outcomes of an investment in the Funds, including the remaining Approximate Cap. Investment involves significant risk. Fund does not invest directly in the underlying stock. As with any investment, there is a risk that you could lose all or a portion of your investment in the Fund. COIO, MSTO, NVDO, PLTO, and TSLO are designed to provide investors with amplified returns (up and down) on innovative companies in the technology sector. The Funds are newly launched and have risks associated with a limited operating history. The Funds are not suitable for all investors. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking monthly leveraged (2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Funds are not intended to be used by, and are not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. For periods longer than one month, the Funds will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than one month. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within the one-month holding period. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Adviser and the Trust, on behalf of the Fund (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), the Adviser has agreed to pay all expenses of the Fund, except for the fee paid to the Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, interest charges on any borrowings, taxes, brokerage commissions and other expenses incurred in placing orders for the purchase and sale of securities and other investment instruments, acquired fund fees and expenses, accrued deferred tax liability, extraordinary expenses, and distribution (12b-1) fees and expenses. PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund's future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns.

Notably, Vanguard Group reported a new position in Venu during the second quarter of 2025, holding 861,911 shares, representing approximately 2.3% of VENU’s outstanding stock, with a current market value of around $13 million, according to its 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The vote of confidence from one of the world’s largest asset managers underscores growing institutional belief in VENU’s long-term growth strategy. In tandem with Vanguard’s stake, VENU also announced the closing of a $10.125 million equity investment from Aramark, in the second quarter, further validating the company's model through strategic capital infusion and operational alignment. This marks a major milestone as Aramark Sports + Entertainment becomes VENU’s exclusive provider of food, beverage, retail, and facility operations for its flagship Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, as well as the forthcoming Sunset Amphitheaters in Texas and Oklahoma.

Scaling with Precision: 20+ Venues in the Pipeline As VENU targets the opening of 20+ smart venues over the next 48–60 months, operational scalability becomes essential. Aramark’s ability to manage large-scale venues, already servicing 300+ sports and entertainment locations, makes it an ideal logistics partner. Their capabilities include: VENU’s venues, featuring app-connected systems, temperature-controlled seating, and AI-powered analytics, will be further enhanced by Aramark’s cutting-edge tools like mobile kiosks, dynamic staffing, and real-time guest insights. A Localized, Branded Experience VENU’s strategy of building destination venues rooted in local identity is bolstered by Aramark’s expertise in integrating regional chefs, craft beverage partners, and local flavors into large-scale hospitality programs.

Lara Rizério Agências de notícias 13/08/2025 09h31 13/08/2025 09h31 Publicidade O governo do presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, está avaliando 11 candidatos para substituir o chair do Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, quando seu mandato expirar em maio de 2026, informou a CNBC nesta quarta-feira, citando dois funcionários do governo. Os novos nomes incluem David Zervos, estrategista-chefe de mercado da Jefferies, Larry Lindsey, ex-governador do Fed, e Rick Rieder, diretor de investimentos de renda fixa global da BlackRock. Eles agora se juntam a uma lista de outros oito candidatos que a CNBC confirmou estarem sob consideração, incluindo a vice-presidente de Supervisão do Fed, Michelle Bowman, o governador do Fed, Chris Waller, e o vice-presidente do Fed, Philip Jefferson. As autoridades também confirmaram que entre os candidatos estão Marc Summerlin, assessor econômico do governo Bush, a presidente do Fed de Dallas, Lorie Logan, e o ex-presidente do Fed de St. Louis, James Bullard. Saiba em 1 minuto quanto seu dinheiro pode render “Incapacidade de compreender conceitos básicos” e “disposição de induzir a erro” são como alguns economistas caracterizam E.J. Antoni, que pode chefiar o Departamento de Estatísticas de Trabalho dos EUA Lula havia dito que não vai telefonar para Trump para negociar a tarifa de 50% imposta sobre produtos brasileiros por considerar que Trump não quer conversar, mas que iria ligar para convidá-lo para a cúpula climática O presidente Trump disse recentemente à CNBC, em uma entrevista, que Kevin Hassett, diretor do Conselho Econômico Nacional, e o ex-governador do Fed, Kevin Warsh, estavam entre os indicados em sua lista. As autoridades descreveram um “processo deliberativo” em que o secretário do Tesouro, Scott Bessent, entrevistará todos os candidatos, selecionará os candidatos e encaminhará a lista final ao presidente para sua decisão. O tamanho da lista e o processo descrito sugerem que uma decisão não é iminente e pode levar um tempo considerável, mas as autoridades não ofereceram um cronograma. Continua depois da publicidade Quanto mais longo o processo, menor a probabilidade de haver um “presidente sombra do Fed” no cargo por vários meses antes da saída de Powell, o que alguns sugeriram que seria prejudicial à política monetária. Embora critique Powell com frequência quase diária, o presidente Trump recuou das sugestões de que poderia substituir o presidente do Fed antes do final de seu mandato em maio. (com Reuters e informações da CNBC) Lara Rizério Editora de mercados do InfoMoney, cobre temas que vão desde o mercado de ações ao ambiente econômico nacional e internacional, além de ficar bem de olho nos desdobramentos políticos e em seus efeitos para os investidores.

The second collection is centered on Indigenous North Americans. The high-quality scholarly works included in the collection have all been previously published in print by the partnering university presses and are now being made openly available in digital form to read and reuse at no cost to the reader or author.” Penn State: New website shows how opioid settlement funds are helping Pennsylvanians. “Researchers at Penn State previously aided the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in determining how to allocate the funds. Now, the team — along with colleagues at Temple University and the University of Pittsburgh — has published a new website that provides detailed, county-level information about how the opioid settlement funds are being used in Pennsylvania.” TWEAKS AND UPDATES Tom’s Hardware: AWS user’s data returned ‘because one human being inside AWS decided to give a damn’. “A software engineer and developer, who previously accused Amazon Web Services (AWS) of a ‘digital execution,’ has shared the good news that his data has now been restored.

The AI craze has intensified in San Francisco, spreading through work and social life in what some have described as a new gold rush. The AI boom, coupled with the election of new Mayor Daniel Lurie, has also infused the city with optimism — tinged with anxiety.

It’s a free-to-use feature that can transform a regular 2D image into a 3D model that can then be used in game creation, animation, 3D printing, VR / AR, and much more.” SECURITY & LEGAL Tampa Free Press: Federal Court Orders White House To Restore Public Spending Database. “The ruling Saturday, from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, denies the government’s request to pause a lower court’s order while it appeals the decision. This means the OMB must make the database and its previously withheld information available to the public by August 15, 2025.” Chicago Sun-Times: Nation’s largest landlord, Greystar, settles price-fixing suit with feds . “In the settlement with Greystar, which still needs approval from a federal judge, Justice Department attorneys said the use of RealPage by Greystar was modern-day price fixing. They did not estimate the impact on renters, but one legal filing noted an apartment complex boasted of using RealPage systems to raise rents 25% in a single year, while also getting their competitors to raise theirs.” United24 Media: Ukraine Warns of Intensified Russian Disinformation Campaign Ahead of Peace Talks . “The Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation (UCCD) has issued a new forecast for Russian disinformation activities in the second half of August, highlighting several key tactics expected to dominate Russian media narratives.” RESEARCH & OPINION Joel Chrono: Webrings, Clubs and Blogrolls I’m part of. “I decided to list as many corners of the internet as I could find, where my website is listed for one reason or another.” Gary Marcus: GPT-5: Overdue, overhyped and underwhelming. And that’s not the worst of it.. “Typical was a comment from Andres Franco, on X ‘GPT 5 has been a huge letdown, way more than I expected’. Another reader, previously an OpenAI fan, told me ‘o3 was a shit good model, [whereas GPT-5] was an utter disappointment, especially given the kind of hype towards its release.’ An NBA President DM’d me to say ‘chatgpt 5 still failed my two fav problems to give LLMs’. Loads of people seemed to sincerely expect GPT-5 was going to be AGI. It doesn’t take decades of training to see that GPT-4 was not that.” Good morning, Internet… This newsletter is free but most of the things that go into making it aren’t!

The trend of awarding massive equity grants to CEOs with already substantial ownership is under scrutiny. These packages, intended to incentivize performance, may instead encourage detrimental behaviors and prioritize personal gain over company success. Boards are urged to prioritize shareholder interests, resist excessive compensation demands, and seek leaders driven by passion for their work rather than solely by financial incentives.

Title: Chrome Worth $1 Trillion For Google?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/13/chrome-worth-1-trillion-for-google/
Time Published: 2025-08-13T09:00:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. How much is Chrome worth to Google? Perplexity AI says it’s worth $34.5 billion. We think that’s perplexing. Maybe it was a product of its own AI engine’s hallucination. Consider 3 facts to start: Google search brought in $265 billion in revenue over the last twelve months. Sure, Perplexity is so generously offering Google search to continue to be the 'default’ engine, for now. But that could change if Perplexity decides later. Who knows. Point is, why would Google want to sell access – literally the starting point to more than half the world’s population – for a pittance? Of course, the answer is – if forced by a judge. With such massive regulatory uncertainty hanging over Google, investors naturally worry about the stock’s volatility. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has comfortably outperformed its benchmark – a combination of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. On a separate note, check out – ETH Price To $10,000? When Perplexity floated that $34.5 billion figure, it revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of Chrome’s true value proposition. Recent assessment puts Chrome’s standalone worth at up to $50 billion,[1] but even that figure misses the forest for the trees. Chrome isn’t just a browser - it's Google's gateway to digital dominance. Think about it this way: Chrome controls the digital journey for 3.5 billion users. Every search query, every ad impression, every data point collected starts with that familiar Chrome interface. You can't put a price tag on owning the front door to the internet. Perplexity’s $34.5 billion valuation suggests they’re treating Chrome like any other tech asset – maybe factoring in user base, revenue attribution and development costs. But that’s exactly where they went wrong. Chrome serves as Google's strategic choke point, drawing users into the Google ecosystem the moment they open the browser. Its address bar funnels search queries directly to Google, while deep integration with Google accounts creates a seamless experience across search, email, and other productivity tools. This isn't just about market share; it's about controlling how billions of people access and interact with the internet, solidifying Google's dominance. Perplexity seems to have missed this entirely. They’re valuing Chrome as if it’s a standalone product when it’s actually the master key to Google’s $2.4 trillion empire. For a deeper dive into how Google’s market position translates to valuation metrics, see our take on Google’s Valuation Comparison. The ongoing DOJ antitrust proceedings have created a nightmare scenario for Google that goes far beyond the $34.5 billion price tag being discussed. The regulatory pressures are mounting from multiple directions – also look at our take on Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit – but the Chrome divestiture represents the most immediate existential threat. If Google is forced to divest Chrome, the company faces risks that make Perplexity’s bid look like pocket change. Losing Chrome means losing the behavioral insights that power Google’s $250+ billion advertising machine. Without direct access to browsing patterns, Google's ability to build detailed user profiles and command premium advertising rates gets severely compromised. A new Chrome owner could switch default search providers overnight, potentially redirecting billions of queries to competitors like Microsoft’s Bing or emerging AI-powered search alternatives. Google's guaranteed access to 3.5 billion users vanishes instantly. Chrome users generate higher-value advertising interactions than users from other browsers. They search more frequently and in ways that are more profitable for Google’s advertising model. Different ownership could disrupt this entire revenue stream. Google Workspace loses its competitive edge over Microsoft Office 365 without Chrome’s tight integration. What’s currently a seamless ecosystem becomes fragmented web applications fighting for user attention. This couldn’t come at a worse time for Google, as Microsoft has been gaining ground on multiple fronts. In fact, Microsoft itself has been riding on a high note – see our take on MSFT Stock to $1,000? Chrome provides real-time insights into how users interact with AI search features and behavioral data necessary to train better AI models. Without this testing ground, Google can’t iterate quickly on AI search improvements or seamlessly integrate new AI capabilities. The most terrifying scenario? New owners could actively promote competing services, block Google integrations, or turn Chrome into a distribution channel for Google's rivals. So while Perplexity and other observers throw around valuations like $34.5 billion or $50 billion, they’re missing the fundamental point. Chrome’s value to Google isn’t measurable in traditional financial metrics because it’s not a standalone business – it’s the foundation upon which Google’s entire digital empire rests. Understanding this foundational role is crucial for grasping Google's growth trajectory – for more on this, see our take on Alphabet's Path To 2x Growth. The real question isn’t what Chrome is worth, but what Google becomes without it. The answer is uncomfortable for Google shareholders: a search engine company that's suddenly competing on a level playing field, without guaranteed access to billions of users, without seamless ecosystem integration, and without the data advantages that have powered its dominance for over two decades. That’s not a $34.5 billion problem. That's an existential crisis. For investors wrestling with whether such regulatory risks make Google a buy or avoid, see our analysis on Buy or Fear Google Stock. Understanding these complex regulatory and competitive dynamics is exactly why comprehensive risk assessment matters in investment decisions. Regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The move strengthens Rocket Lab's role as a prime contractor for U.S. defense programs such as Golden Dome for America and the Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. It adds optical systems capabilities to Rocket Lab's offerings, enabling complete spacecraft solutions for national security missions. Geost, founded in 2004, develops electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor systems for missile warning, tracking, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, Earth observation, and space domain awareness. These systems are designed for both classified and unclassified missions, operating in contested space environments. Integration with Rocket Lab will allow Geost to scale EO/IR production through enhanced manufacturing resources, enabling high-volume delivery for critical defense needs. Rocket Lab CEO Sir Peter Beck stated: "Being able to quickly build and deploy entire satellite systems is the cornerstone of future U.S. defense strategy, and with this acquisition, we're accelerating the delivery of mission critical payloads that support U.S. national security projects. This acquisition strengthens our role in building the resilient, responsive space architecture envisioned under Golden Dome, combining Geost's proven sensing technologies with Rocket Lab's ability to scale fast, secure, and integrated space solutions." Bill Gattle, CEO of Lightridge Solutions, said: "This is a pivotal next step for Geost. Becoming part of Rocket Lab enables Geost to take its sensing technologies further, faster-joining forces with a company that's redefining space system delivery. Geost is excited to partner with a team that shares a commitment to speed, innovation, and national purpose. Together, Geost and Rocket Lab can scale production, accelerate delivery, and strengthen the critical space capabilities our nation depends on." Geost will maintain operations in Arizona and Virginia, expanding Rocket Lab's U.S. footprint and adding its product assets, intellectual property, manufacturing sites, laboratories, and inventory to the company's resources.

Institutional investors and Ethereum ETFs have primarily driven the rally that began earlier this month. This bullish sentiment will also have a positive impact on the wider market and top ERC-20 tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) as traders seek to diversify their investments. Growing appetite for $ETH has driven its price since the beginning of August, resulting in a record number of inflows on Monday of over $1B, based on data from SoSo Value. BlackRock has been one of the biggest winners so far, after its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF reportedly accounted for $640M of these inflows. But investors aren’t done buying $ETH just yet. On Monday, SharpLink Gaming announced a raise of $400M to growing its $ETH holdings to over $3B. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion also expanded its Ethereum stash in a single week from 833,137 to its current holdings of over 1,150,263. This further extends the company’s lead as the biggest owner of $ETH and the third-biggest in DAT (total value of digital assets held). This flurry of activity has resulted in a 27.36% increase in Ethereum’s value in just seven days. It’s also been up by 6.93% in the last 24 hours, and is currently trading at $4,623. As Ethereum returns to its late 2021 levels, we can already expect traders to look for other investments to put their money in. ERC-20 tokens are potential winners too, especially Ethereum crypto presales. They’re typically very cheap and offer a huge growth potential, making them extremely attractive to investors. Here are three worth considering: There’s no denying that Bitcoin remains king, as it continues to attract institutional investors like Strategy, which now holds 628,946 Bitcoins, valued at $75B. You’re looking at a future Bitcoin Layer 2, which will improve transaction speed and lower the fees, while also expanding the crypto’s utility according to modern demands. The key to this is the Canonical Bridge that will let you send $BTC from Layer 1 to Layer 2 as wrapped $BTC. The latter is a high-speed environment powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which enables fast transactions and low fees while keeping Bitcoin’s robust security intact. You only need to deposit $BTC to get started. The system will verify and mint wrapped $BTC on the Layer 2. This will allow you to use this wrapped $BTC for staking, trading, and interacting with dApps—things that aren’t possible with Bitcoin. Here’s a comprehensive guide on Bitcoin Hyper if you want to learn more about it. To support the project, you can join the Bitcoin Hyper presale and buy tokens for $0.012675 each. You can also stake your tokens, if you prefer, and earn rewards at a rate of 120% p.a. Our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide has all the details you need to get your hands on $HYPER. Our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction estimates a $0.15-$0.32 price range for the end of 2025, which would mean a 1,090%-2,430% potential growth if you invest now. Buy Bitcoin Hyper tokens today to join an upcoming revolution in Bitcoin programmability and scalability. As demand for cryptocurrencies grows, it becomes more difficult to find high-quality ones. This is the case when you’re looking for the best meme coins. It’s like playing Russian roulette sometimes, as some could be scams that could cost you your hard-earned money. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in. With just a few clicks, you’ll be able to snipe, trade tokens, manage your portfolio, and more. The bot also comes with a honeypot and rugpull detection feature that will help keep scammers and hackers at bay. Holding its native $SNORT token opens up even more perks when Snorter Bot launches, such as low transaction fees and governance rights. Of course, you’ll also be able to use it to pay for gas fees. $SNORT is currently available for only $0.1011 via the Snorter Token presale page. The staking rewards are very generous too at 143% p.a. Alternatively, you can consider HODLing as the token could reach as much as $3.25 by 2030 based on our Snorter Token price prediction. Whether you want to HODL, trade, or stake $SNORT, now’s your chance to take part in one of this year’s best presales. Join the Snorter Token presale today. Like $DOGE that it’s trying to parody, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) started out as a joke back in 2021. But now it’s so much more than that. It’s a payment method not just in crypto payment platforms but also in retailers, restaurants, and digital wallets. The coin had its peak back in late 2021, reaching a price of around $0.000088, based on TradingView data. While it’s mostly hovered around $0.000012-$0.000015 this year, $SHIB has been quite hot lately as it grew by a considerable 12.53% in the last seven days. While some traders might argue that the coin’s glory days are behind it, there are still many who remain bullish about $SHIB. With a market capitalization of over $8B and over 1.5M wallets holding it, it’s not the type of meme coin that will go away soon. Unlike the two previous ERC-20 coins we covered, $SHIB is widely available in major exchanges. Its low price, high liquidity, and wide availability can help you practice your trading without burning a hole in your wallet. As Ethereum broke past $4,500, it’s safe to say that its rally isn’t over yet. Like Bitcoin’s surge in July, we expect institutional investors to push $ETH’s price to greater heights, with a potential to return to its $4,800 ATH set in 2021. ERC-20 tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) will be in other investors’ sights too if the trend continues. That’s because these investors will be looking at other promising coins to put their money in, in the hopes of growing their gains further. Disclaimer: Do your own research before you invest.

Title: Jobs at stake: Legislation could shield employees facing an AI threat

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. On the heels of news of layoffs at an Indian information technology (IT) behemoth that may be attributed to artificial intelligence (AI), a private member’s bill to protect employees from the use of AI in the workplace has been presented in the Rajya Sabha by Trinamool Congress member Mausam Noor. This Artificial Intelligence (Protection of Rights of Employees) Bill is narrower in scope than its European counterpart, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which intends to cover AI risks in general. The Indian private member’s bill, in contrast, focuses squarely on employee rights in the workplace. Also Read: The AI revolution could leave women even further behind. Here's how. To understand the need for such legislation, look no further than US tech giants. Amazon, for example, has been developing machine learning algorithms since 2014 for warehouse logistics, pricing decisions, etc. One of these works as a recruitment tool by scoring candidates on a scale of one to five stars and then picking the top resume from the hundreds received for every Amazon job. In 2015, the company discovered that its algorithm favoured male candidates, as it had been trained on successful resumes of the preceding 10 years, which were mostly of male applicants. The algorithm had ‘learnt’ that male candidates were preferred. Resumes of women with pursuits such as ‘chess’ or ‘debate’ were given an even more unfavourable rating. Although Amazon initially tried to amend its algorithm, it ultimately abandoned the project. The Indian bill attempts to tackle this problem by proposing the “mitigation of biases in AI algorithms that may adversely affect employees’ rights or opportunities by regular conduct of performance audits and impact assessment." Also Read: Outrage over AI is pointless if we’re clueless about AI models Additionally, it attempts to replicate the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whose Article 22 provides that “the data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her." In this context, the Indian bill’s text requires ‘consent’ to be obtained from an employee whose data is to be utilized. While it is a step in the right direction, the bill in its current form faces challenges. Audit and overview: The Indian bill mandates organizations to conduct an Equality Impact Assessment at five-year intervals to ensure “fairness, non-discrimination, and compliance with established rules and regulations." A five-year period in the context of AI development is like an eternity. The EU’s AI Act requires the registration of any ‘high risk’ AI system to increase transparency. Such timely registration in India would be a good idea. Also Read: AI didn’t take the job. It changed what the job is. Consent: India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) emphasizes consent as the primary enabler of personal data processing. The Trinamool member’s AI bill too mandates ‘explicit’ consent in writing from employees who would be affected by an AI algorithm. But achieving explicit consent in a country as economically and educationally diverse as India would pose employers a challenge. While the DPDPA suggests the use of ‘consent managers’ to ensure consensual flow of personal data between data subjects and fiduciaries, how employers could ensure explicit and continued consent remains unclear. Employer versus employee rights: The DPDPA grants employers the right to process employee data for ‘legitimate uses’: “for the purposes of employment or those related to safeguarding the employer from loss or liability, such as prevention of corporate espionage, maintenance of confidentiality of trade secrets, intellectual property, classified information or provision of any service or benefit sought by a Data Principal who is an employee." Conversely, the AI bill under discussion requires Indian authorities to protect the rights of employees where they “refuse tasks or decisions solely based on AI-generated processes if they feel these violate their rights or ethical standards." It also grants them the right to review high-risk decisions made by AI processes, affording them an opportunity to “challenge choices or decisions adversely impacting their employment." A possible clash is envisaged between the rights of an employer that wants to use employee data and the rights of employees who want such data removed. Also Read: Devina Mehra: Yes, AI is coming for our jobs; it’s the old story of new tech AI implementation for payroll reduction: Perhaps to address concerns around impending layoffs arising from the adoption of AI-based models by Indian businesses, the proposed legislation requires the provision of “adequate training and up-skilling opportunities for employees affected by AI implementation" to ensure that “they can effectively adapt and engage with the technology." Given that AI models are often inducted by employers to reduce their payroll costs, it would be counter-intuitive to require organizations to incur expenditure on those it may intend to retrench. While well-intended, this clause would result in additional business expenditure. The AI bill proposed by Mausam Noor, while more narrowly focused than its EU counterpart, attempts to provide a crucial legal foundation for safeguarding employee rights in the face of increasing AI integration in the workplace and aims to address concerns about job security, discrimination and privacy. It also underscores the need for transparent, fair and human-centric AI development and deployment in a relatively labour-intensive economy such as ours. The author is an independent privacy lawyer.

Title: Trump's tariffs keep coming. Stock markets don't seem to care.
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/how-trump-tariffs-impact-stock-market-investors-rcna224521
Time Published: 2025-08-13T00:46:13Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time At least for now, the U.S. stock market is on board with President Donald Trump’s increasingly aggressive use of executive power when it comes to tariffs. On Tuesday, major stock indexes hit fresh all-time highs as investors digested an inflation report that was mostly tamer than feared. While the details of the report suggest an overall mixed picture for the economy, it suggested fears of large immediate price increases from Trump’s tariffs may no longer be warranted. “Many prices will end up rising in time due to tariffs, but we don’t see inflation pressures persisting,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said in a note to clients. “We are in a very different situation to 2021/22 when inflation soared to 9%.” While the rate of inflation for some goods exposed to tariffs picked up in July, it was weaker for others, like appliances and apparel. Last month’s heavier price increases were instead mainly found in service sectors like airfare and auto insurance rates. “The strength was concentrated to a few specific components and not broad based,” analysts with Citi said in a note. Tariffs are costs added to imports in the form of taxes. Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated that consumers have been responsible for as much as 22% of the cost increases, with the percentage set to climb as the tariffs work their way more fully into supply chains — though Trump attacked Goldman’s estimates Tuesday. Efforts by firms to stockpile goods ahead of the tariffs’ impacts, as well as summer discounts and ongoing tariff deadline extensions by Trump, have insulated consumers from further effects. Tariffs continue to get negative reaction in surveys, with a mid-July Fox News poll showing Americans disapproved of Trump on tariffs by a 26-point margin. That was virtually unchanged from April, when Trump revealed shock new tariff levels in his Rose Garden “Liberation Day” speech announcing soaring new import duty levels. Stocks, meanwhile, continue to shrug them off. After Tuesday’s inflation report, traders increased the odds of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its next meeting in September. When markets expect the Federal Reserve to loosen financial conditions and make it easier for businesses to borrow money, stocks tend to rise because firms will have to pay less money in interest. Stocks’ recent behavior is in stark contrast to their dramatic spring sell-off in the wake of April’s “Liberation Day” speech. Investor reaction was so intense that Trump instituted a 90-day pause to reconsider what was set to be a cornerstone of his second administration’s economic policy. Today, Trump’s focus on tariffs hasn’t abated — but he has dialed back the more maximalist tariff levels he initially outlined. Combined with signs of a shakier labor market, investors are more convinced that the Fed will err on the side of supporting the economy by lowering interest rates to support overall business activity. The performance of the stock market itself isn’t a full picture of the broader economy, however. Instead, the gains of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increasingly reflect the outsized returns of a handful of tech companies that investors believe will reap massive gains from their investments in artificial intelligence technology. The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Alphabet (Google’s parent), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — now account for one-third of the weighted average of the S&P 500, the broadest index of stocks Reuters reported last month, citing data from LSEG Datastream consultancy. According to analysis from Morgan Stanley, at the end of July, just 9% of companies that make up the S&P 500 were at 52-week highs. The index’s movements are thus now heavily correlated with changes to the outlook of a handful of companies. If just one of them underperforms, it can take the entire market down with it. “When a handful of stocks dominate the market ... if you do have a period of disappointment from those stocks, you could see disproportionate impacts on your portfolio from just a handful of company-specific issues,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede financial group, told Reuters. Small businesses remain especially vulnerable to the impact of tariffs, since they have less pricing power than larger firms. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the country’s largest small-business trade group, reported Tuesday that a shrinking share of respondents say they are profitable. “Increased costs are affecting everyone. I believe things will improve, but it will take time — six to 12 months. I just hope small businesses can hold on that long,” the NFIB quoted an unnamed fabricated metal product manufacturing firm in Michigan as saying in a July report. The U.S. economy isn’t out of the woods yet, said Kevin Gordon, director and senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab financial group. Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report a separate measure of inflation that tracks wholesale inflation, or what producers get for their products and which tends to be more closely watched by the Federal Reserve. If it shows more pronounced signs of inflation than what Tuesday’s report suggested, stocks could quickly come down from their new highs. Barring that, conditions remain more benign than feared, he said, potentially setting the stage for further stock gains. “Weaker growth is not a concern at the moment,” he said. “Yes, there’s been some pullback, but it doesn’t mean we’re in any kind of recessionary scenario.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Nuclear-powered AI could make Rolls Royce UK's most valuable firm, says boss
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8772d4jzgo
Time Published: 2025-08-12T23:01:03Z

Rolls-Royce's plan to power artificial intelligence (AI) with its nuclear reactors could make it the UK's most valuable company, its boss has said. The engineering firm has signed deals to provide small modular reactors (SMRs) to the UK and Czech governments. AI has boomed in popularity since 2022, but the technology uses lots of energy, something which has raised practical and environmental concerns. Rolls-Royce chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic told the BBC it has the "potential" to become the UK's highest-valued company by overtaking the largest firms on the London Stock Exchange thanks to its SMR deals. "There is no private company in the world with the nuclear capability we have. If we are not market leader globally, we did something wrong," he said. Mr Erginbilgic has overseen a ten-fold increase in Rolls-Royce's share price since taking over in January 2023. However, he has ruled out the idea of Rolls-Royce seeking to list its shares in New York as British chip designer Arm has done and the likes of Shell and AstraZeneca have considered in the search for higher valuations. This is despite the fact that 50% of its shareholders and customers are US-based. "It's not in our plan," said Mr Erginbilgic, a Turkish energy industry veteran. "I don't agree with the idea you can only perform in the US. That's not true and hopefully we have demonstrated that." Rolls-Royce already supplies the reactors that have powered dozens of nuclear submarines. Mr Erginbilgic said the company has a massive advantage in the future market of bringing that technology on land in the form of SMRs. SMRs are not only smaller but quicker to build than traditional nuclear plants, with costs likely to come down as units are rolled out. He estimates that the world will need 400 SMRs by 2050. At a cost of up to $3bn (£2.2bn) each, that's another trillion dollar-plus market he wants and expects Rolls-Royce to dominate. The company has signed a deal to develop six SMRs for the Czech Republic and is developing three for the UK. But it remains an unproven technology. Mr Erginbilgic conceded he could not currently point to a working SMR example but said he was confident in its future potential. There are also concerns about the demands on water supplies from the data centre and SMR cooling systems. In response, companies including Google, Microsoft and Meta have signed deals to take energy from SMRs in the US when they are available. Rolls-Royce sees SMRs as key to its future, but its biggest business is aircraft engines. Already dominant in supplying engines to wide-bodied aircraft like Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, it plans to break into the next generation of narrow-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. This market is worth $1.6tn - nine times that of the wide-bodied . Rolls-Royce is a bit player in a market that has powerful and successful leaders, and that rival Pratt and Witney lost $8bn trying and failing to break into. The market is dominated by CFM International – a joint venture between US-based GE Aerospace and French company Safran Aerospace Engines. Industry veterans told the BBC that market leaders can and will drop prices to airline customers long enough to see off a new assault on their market dominance. But Mr Erginbilgic said this is not just the biggest business opportunity for Rolls-Royce. Rather, it is "for industrial strategy... the single biggest opportunity for the UK for economic growth". "No other UK opportunity, I challenge, will match that," he said. Although BMW has owned the Rolls Royce car brand for nearly 30 years, the name of the company is still synonymous with British engineering excellence. But in the early part of this decade that shine had worn off. The company was heavily indebted, its profit margins were non-existent, and thousands of staff were being laid off. When Mr Erginbilgic took over in January 2023, he likened the company to "a burning platform". "Our cost of capital was 12%, our return was 4% so every time we invested we destroyed value," he said. Two and a half years later, the company expects to make a profit of over £3bn, its debt levels have fallen and shares have risen over 1,000% - a ten-fold rise. So how did that happen? And is Mr Erginbilgic right to think that Rolls-Royce's roll is only just starting? The timing of his appointment was fortunate according to some industry veterans. Rolls-Royce's biggest business – supplying engines to commercial airlines – has rebounded strongly from the Covid pandemic. The company's most successful product – the Trent series of aircraft engines – are at the sweet spot of profitability as the returns on investment in their development over a decade ago begin to pour into company coffers. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 arguably made it almost inevitable that its defence business would see higher spending from European governments – which has been confirmed by recent announcements. Unions have not always been fans of Mr Erginbilgic's hard-charging approach. In October 2023, one of his first major move was cutting jobs, which drew criticism from Sharon Graham, the boss of the Unite union. "This announcement appears to be about appeasing the markets and its shareholders while ignoring its workers," she said at the time. However, overall global headcount has grown from 43,000 to 45,000 since 2023 and union sources say there is "grudging respect" for Mr Erginbilgic. Those sources give him one third of the credit for the turnaround around in the company's fortunes, with a third credited to market conditions and a third to his predecessor Warren East for "steadying the ship". So does Mr Erginbilgic really believe that Rolls-Royce can be the UK's most valuable company – overtaking the likes of AstraZeneca, HSBC, and Shell? "We are now number five in the FTSE. I believe the growth potential we created in the company right now, in our existing business and our new businesses, actually yes – we have that potential." Rolls-Royce is undoubtedly a company with the wind at its back – and Tufan Erginbilgic certainly believes he has set the sails just right.

Title: Are return-to-work orders, layoffs driving moms from workforce?
URL: https://www.deseret.com/family/2025/08/12/layoffs-child-care-job-flexibility-driving-moms-from-workforce/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T21:27:50Z
Full Content:
A significant number of working moms are heading home and an analysis in The Washington Post says a dearth of child care and job layoffs are together driving the exodus. Per the Post, “The share of working mothers age 25 to 44 with young children has fallen nearly every month this year, dropping by nearly 3 percentage points between January and June, to the lowest level in more than three years,” based on an analysis of federal data by Misty Heggeness, a professor at the University of Kansas and former principal economist at the Census Bureau. Working moms got some of the credit for the job market’s post-pandemic comeback, the Post reported. But that’s changing as remote work and flexible schedules are disappearing and government layoffs have sent many others home. According to the Labor Department, roughly 212,000 women older than 20 have stopped working or seeking jobs since January. There’s an especially big drop for Black women and those ages 25 to 34, per the data. “The U.S. is the only advanced economy that’s had declining female labor force participation in the last 20 years, and a lot of that is because of lack of social safety net and caregiving supports,” Kate Bahn, chief economist at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, told the Post. She called it a long-term trend that appears to be worsening. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in July that 57.1% of women 16 and older were in the workforce. Among those 20 and over, the share was 58.9%, compared to 70.5% of men. Time reported that 212,000 women age 20 and over have left the workforce this year, noting that “by contrast, 44,000 men have entered the workforce since January.” That article, too, quoted Heggeness. She said that between January and June, labor force participation for women ages 25 to 44 who lived with a child younger than 5 fell almost 3 percentage points, to 55.9%. “It’s a big reversal,” per Time. “The participation of those women had soared in 2022, 2023 and 2024, peaking in January 2025, as flexible work policies helped women join the workforce and generate much-needed income for their families.” The federal government ordered workers back to the office five days a week in January and so did some big companies, including Amazon, JP Morgan and AT&T. The Flex Index reported that just under a quarter of Fortune 500 companies had returned to in-office, full-time staffing by the end of the second quarter. The index tracks trends in remote work. Still, the index said just one-third of companies require everyone to work in the office; most still have hybrid work arrangements. But 43% of those are structured, with most requiring three days in the office and allowing two days remote. The index also notes that a “clear compliance gap exists.” Attendance has in some cases been low. Structured hybrid is common with large companies, while small companies tend toward flexible schedules. Julie Vogtman of National Women’s Law Center told Time that it’s “not a coincidence that women’s participation in the workforce is falling as flexibility disappears. Women capitalized on remote work and flexibility during the pandemic and stopped exiting the labor force. Now many are not able to do so.” “Women still take on the lion’s share of caregiving responsibilities, and they are more likely than men to be navigating how to meet those caregiving responsibilities while holding down a job,” she said. “They are also more likely than men to feel that they have to leave the workforce when their balancing act becomes unmanageable.” Time notes another reason women have left the workforce this year. “Some of the decline in participation comes from lower-income women in jobs that have historically had to be done in person full-time, even during the pandemic. Those women are struggling because federal dollars for childcare have declined significantly in 2025. That money helped many centers stay open and charge lower tuition than they otherwise would have. That funding ended in September 2024, forcing many centers to close or raise tuition, leaving some families without options." Correction: An earlier version of this story got Julie Vogtman’s first name wrong. The story has been updated.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Index Hits Record High as Expectations of a Rate Cut Rise

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed to all-time highs Tuesday after a report showed the annual rate of inflation held stead in July, boosting expectations the Federal Reserve could decide to lower interest rates at its meeting in September. The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and the Nasdaq gained 1.4% to set closing records. The Dow added 1.1%, leaving it roughly 1% away from a new closing high. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Spirit Aviation Holdings (FLYY) warned it may be unable to continue operations, citing an insufficient cash supply and difficulties in navigating operational challenges. Shares of the low-cost airline, which emerged from bankruptcy in March, plunged more than 40%, while shares of rival carriers rose. United Airlines (UAL) shares logged Tuesday's top performance in the S&P 500, jumping 10.2%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) shares gained 9.2%. Paramount Skydance (PSKY) stock surged 8.4%. With Tuesday's push higher, shares of the newly combined entertainment giant roared back from losses posted in the prior session after the announcement of a $7.7 billion deal with TKO Group (TKO) to acquire the exclusive broadcasting rights for the sports firm's Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) franchise. Raymond James analysts suggested the UFC deal could signal the beginning of a more aggressive approach toward spending on content and sports rights by Paramount's management team, now led by Skydance Media founder David Ellison. Several semiconductor stocks also gained ground, with shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Onsemi (ON) adding 7.3% and 6.2%, respectively. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) advanced 3.2%. Cardinal Health (CAH) shares suffered the steepest drop in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, falling 7.2% after the company announced a $1.9 billion deal to acquire Solaris Health. With the transaction, the provider of healthcare products and services aims to expand its presence in urology markets. Cardinal revealed the planned transaction in conjunction with its fiscal fourth-quarter results. Although adjusted profits topped forecasts, revenue came in below expectations, reflecting continued pressure after last year's expiration of its contracts with pharmacy benefit manager OptumRX. Shares of Axon Enterprise (AXON), maker of the Taser and other law enforcement equipment, dropped 6.1% after SEC filings revealed that several executives sold significant stakes in the company. Investors often view sales by company insiders as an indication of wavering confidence in a stock's near-term trajectory. Axon shares tore higher at the beginning of August after the company reported strong earnings results, boosted by demand for its AI-enabled products, but the stock has given back most of those gains over the past week. Albemarle (ALB) shares slipped 3.4% on Tuesday, reversing a portion of the upswing posted in the prior session as news of a shutdown at a major mine in China suggested possible relief from oversupply in the lithium market. Albemarle, the largest producer of the key battery component, said Tuesday that its La Negra lithium processing plant in Chile was operating normally after a local official said authorities were investigating an incident that occurred last week.

August 12, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Adagene Inc. Adagene Inc. Muzastotug (ADG126) Phase 1b/2 in MSS CRC shows 19.4-month median OS (mOS) in 10 mg/kg dose cohorts; mOS for 20 mg/kg cohorts has not yet been reached Alignment with FDA on Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial design elements. Company expects to begin enrolling patients in Phase 2 in 2H 2025 SAFEbody option exercised and up to US$25 million strategic investment by Sanofi, with cash runway extended into 2027 Sanofi will conduct a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with ADG126 in over 100 patients Strengthened leadership team with key additions Partnered with ConjugateBio for development of bispecific ADCs SAN DIEGO and SUZHOU, China, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adagene Inc. (“Adagene” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ADAG), a platform-driven, clinical-stage biotechnology company transforming the discovery and development of novel antibody-based therapies, today reported financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2025, and provided corporate updates. “The first half of 2025 was tremendously important for Adagene, as we shared the early overall survival benefit with ADG126 in combination with Merck’s (known as MSD outside of the US and Canada) anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) that exceeds standard of care and is highly competitive with data from other products in development. The safety and tolerability data from ADG126 in combination with pembrolizumab in our Phase 1b/2 study in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer contributes to a large body of growing evidence that the power of CTLA-4 inhibition can be harnessed more safely with our approach utilizing conditional activation in the tumor microenvironment. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were less than 20%, which is an outstanding achievement given that ADG126 was dosed 10 to 20 times higher than the approved CTLA-4 inhibitors, in order to drive dose-dependent depletion of regulatory T-cells at the desired level inside tumors,” said Peter Luo, Ph.D., Chairman, CEO and President of R&D at Adagene. “Now that we have aligned with the FDA on Phase 2 and Phase 3 design elements, which do not require an ADG126 monotherapy arm, we have a clear line of sight into what will be required for regulatory approval. We look forward to initiating the Phase 2 study later this year.” PIPELINE HIGHLIGHTS ADG126 - Phase 1b/2 data and regulatory update: As presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Poster #248), mOS for the 10 mg/kg cohorts was 19.4 months in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) patients free of liver metastasis (NLM), comparing favorably with historical fruquintinib benchmarks of 10.8 months from the FRESCOi study and 12.1 months from the FRESCO-2ii study for the same NLM patient population. Only 1 out of 41 patients in the 10 mg/kg cohorts was censored due to early withdrawal within the first 12 months. Median OS for the 20 mg/kg cohorts has not yet been reached. ADG126 showed a 29% confirmed overall response rate (ORR) in MSS CRC. ADG126 can be dosed at 20 mg/kg Q6W in combination with KEYTRUDA® (200 mg, Q3W) with less than 20% Grade 3 adverse events having been observed. All six responders in the 20 mg/kg cohorts remain on treatment, with four patients on study for over one year. As recently reported, Adagene has now gained alignment with the FDA on Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial design elements for ADG126, and the Company plans to begin enrollment in 2H 2025. In addition, Adagene has initiated evaluation of ADG126 plus pembrolizumab in combination with standard of care in MSS CRC patients, as approved by the Merck/Adagene joint development committee and supported by the 2021 supply agreement between the two partners. MAJOR COLLABORATIONS Sanofi: In July, Sanofi agreed to make a strategic investment of up to US$25 million in Adagene. The Company plans to use the proceeds to fund its research and development activities, including clinical development of ADG126, through a randomized Phase 2 trial in MSS CRC. To further explore the clinical potential of ADG126, Adagene will supply Sanofi with ADG126 to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and biomarker data in combination with other anticancer therapies in over 100 patients in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in advanced solid tumors. Adagene continues to own worldwide commercial rights to ADG126. Sanofi has also exercised its option to select a third SAFEbody discovery program, utilizing Adagene’s proprietary masking technology and antibody engineering expertise. The bispecific therapeutic, with undisclosed targets, will be engineered by Adagene and induces an option exercise fee, as well as milestones and royalties as per the 2022 partnership agreement. Exelixis: Including upfront and other milestone payments, Adagene has received over US$18 million in total from Exelixis to date, under a technology license agreement to develop novel masked antibody-drug conjugate candidates. ConjugateBio: In July 2025, Adagene entered into a partnering agreement with ConjugateBio to develop novel antibody drug conjugates. Adagene will provide ConjugateBio with a proprietary antibody for use in partner companies’ bispecific ADC development programs. CORPORATE UPDATES In April, Adagene appointed John Maraganore, Ph.D. as Executive Advisor to provide strategic guidance, and to contribute to Adagene’s growth, value creation and benefit for patients. In May, Mickael Chane-Du joined Adagene as Chief Strategy Officer to promote and advance Adagene’s financing, internal strategic planning and external business development efforts. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Cash and Cash Equivalents:Cash and cash equivalents were US$62.8 million as of June 30, 2025, compared to US$85.2 million as of December 31, 2024. Total borrowings from commercial banks in China (denominated in RMB) decreased to US$6.6 million as of June 30, 2025 from US$18.2 million as of December 31, 2024. Further, the cash balance as of June 30, 2025 does not include any equity proceed received from Sanofi in July 2025. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses:R&D expenses were US$12.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to US$14.7 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of approximately 18% in R&D expenses reflects clinical focus on and prioritization of the company’s masked, anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody ADG126. Administrative Expenses:Administrative expenses were US$3.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to US$3.6 million for the same period in 2024. Net Loss:Net loss attributable to Adagene Inc.’s shareholders was US$13.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to US$17.0 million for the same period in 2024. Ordinary Shares Outstanding:As of June 30, 2025, there were 58,914,087 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Each American depository share, or ADS, represents one and one quarter (1.25) ordinary shares of the company. Non-GAAP Net Loss: Non-GAAP net loss, which is defined as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period after excluding share-based compensation expenses, was US$11.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to US$14.5 million for the same period in 2024. Please refer to the section in this press release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” for details. Non-GAAP Financial Measures: The company uses non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period, which are non-GAAP financial measures, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period help identify underlying trends in the company’s business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that the company includes in its loss for the period. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period provide useful information about its results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to operating profit, loss for the period or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of its operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period and the reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the company’s data. The company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period represent net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period excluding share-based compensation expenses. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees. The company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expenses from the net loss in the “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” assists management and investors in making meaningful period-to-period comparisons in the company's operating performance or peer group comparisons because (i) the amount of share-based compensation expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the company’s underlying performance, (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, and (iii) other companies may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their share-based compensation. Please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” included in this press release for a full reconciliation of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period to net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period.

Title: NVDA Vs. NVDY: What Your Pick Says About Your Investing Style

Time Published: 2025-08-12T19:53:52Z

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Nvidia is the crown jewel of the AI boom. But how you choose to invest in it, either directly through NVDA stock or indirectly via the NVDY covered call income ETF, reflects your risk appetite, time horizon and definition of returns. This article explores which option (NVDA stock vs. NVDY) is a better fit for your portfolio and what your choice reveals about your investor persona. The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY) is an actively managed fund that does not invest directly in Nvidia shares, but delivers a far higher income yield vs. NVDA. The fund’s staggering trailing twelve-month (TTM) distribution yield of nearly 80% stems from a unique strategy that generates monthly income through options without actually owning NVDA stock. To achieve this, NVDY implements a “synthetic covered call” strategy by which it To generate monthly income by selling short-term covered calls, NVDY first needs a long exposure to NVDA stock. Rather than buying NVDA shares outright, NVDY creates a cheaper, synthetic long position by This combo allows NVDY to simulate NVDA stock’s price moves, without actually buying the stock. These call and put options typically have durations of one to six months and strike prices near NVDA’s current price at the time these option contracts are executed. The synthetic long position provides NVDY with exposure that is nearly identical to owning NVDA stock. If NVDA rises, the call gains in value and if NVDA falls, the put incurs a loss. If NVDA stays flat, typically both options may expire worthless, and the fund may lose the cost of the call, but this will be offset by the premium received from the short put. Suppose NVDA stock is currently trading at $200/share. NVDY buys a call option with a strike price of $200 (at-the-money) by paying a premium of $15. (Premiums vary depending on volatility and expiration, and the $15 figures here are for illustrative purposes.) This gives NVDY the right to buy NVDA at $200. If NVDA rises to $250, the call option’s value would increase to $50. Subtracting the $15 premium paid, the net profit on the call is $35. As part of the synthetic strategy, NVDY also sells a put option with a $200 strike price, receiving a $15 premium. This gives it the obligation to buy NVDA at $200 if the price falls below that level. If NVDA drops to $150, NVDY is forced to buy at $200, incurring a $50 loss on the put. After subtracting the $15 premium received, the net loss is $35. These call and put options together form a synthetic long position, mimicking the payoff of directly owning the stock. Although synthetic ownership is more complex than buying shares directly, it is significantly more capital-efficient. For example, buying 100 shares of NVDA at $200 each would require $20,000 upfront. A synthetic long position created by buying a call and selling a put at the same $200 strike can replicate this exposure. If the premiums for both options are around $15 each, the net upfront premium may be close to zero. Since each options contract typically represents 100 shares, this setup simulates $20,000 of stock exposure with little or no net premium paid. However, this does not mean the position is free. The short put side of the trade introduces significant downside risk and typically requires substantial margin or collateral. While the strategy uses less capital than directly purchasing the stock, margin requirements and potential losses can be huge. This is an oversimplified example meant to illustrate the concept of capital efficiency. In practice, actual capital requirements and risk exposure will vary depending on market conditions and brokerage policies. Investors don’t need to worry about this nitty-gritty, NVDY fund managers will handle the complexities. NVDY then sells calls against this synthetic long position to generate income from premiums. These call options are typically short-term (expiring within one month or less) and are written at strike prices 0–15% above NVDA’s current price at the time. If NVDA’s price goes up, NVDY makes gains up to the strike price, but anything above that is capped, because the fund sold away that upside in exchange for income. If NVDA stays flat or dips slightly, NVDY retains the premium from selling the call options. This is its main source of monthly income. NVDY also holds short-term U.S. Treasuries that not only serve as collateral for the options in connection with its synthetic covered call strategy, but also earn some interest. NVDY also employs a “Covered Call Spread” strategy—a more nuanced variation of the traditional covered call—used when it anticipates a sharp short-term rise in NVDA’s price or when market conditions make spreads more advantageous than outright calls. In this strategy, NVDY sells a call option while simultaneously buying a call option with a higher strike price but the same expiration date. This approach still generates income and, if NVDA’s price surges, allows NVDY to participate in more upside than a regular covered call would. NVDA stock and NVDY are both Nvidia-focused investments but serve different goals: NVDA stock is regarded as a growth superstar, while NVDY is designed as a tactical income generator. For NVDA investors, gains and losses move in lockstep with the stock price. But, NVDY’s returns, shaped by its synthetic long structure, follow a more complicated path. So, we notice that drawdowns are more or less similar for NVDA and NVDY, but gains are capped for NVDY. So, why invest in NVDY at all? Because of the outsized income yield from NVDY that far surpasses NVDA’s. NVDY pays varying monthly distributions, while NVDA pays a penny in quarterly dividends. On a TTM basis, NVDY has paid distributions totaling $14.04/share, equating to 78.7% distribution yield based on NVDY’s last closing price of $17.85. This far surpasses NVDA’s 0.02% forward yield or annual payout of 4 cents/share on a forward basis. Price performance and Total Returns (including dividends/distributions): Even with NVDY’s hefty monthly distributions, NVDA has delivered stronger total returns. NVDY’s monthly payouts are a mix of return of capital (ROC) and ordinary income (such as option premiums and interest from Treasuries) For example: Why this breakdown matters: Return of capital isn’t taxed when received. Instead, it reduces your cost basis in the ETF, which can increase taxable capital gains when you sell. Illustration: Once your cost basis is reduced to zero, any further ROC distributions are treated entirely as capital gains for tax purposes. The income portion of the payout, however, is taxable in the year received. For July, this would mean the remaining 63% of the distribution was taxable income. Expense Ratio: YieldMax lists NVDY’s gross expense ratio as 0.99%, while many third-party sites like Yahoo Finance report the net expense ratio as 1.27%. That means an investor pays $127 annually for every $10,000 invested in NVDY. Let’s say an investor bought 1,000 shares of NVDY a year ago at around $24/share: Even after accounting for the $304.80 annual fee (1.27% of $24,000), the net income is still exceptionally high. In other words, the expense ratio barely dents NVDY’s income advantage. Since its inception on May 10, 2023, when it was trading around $20, NVDY has paid out $32.71 in distributions. Investors who purchased one share at launch would have recovered their full initial investment and realized an additional $12.71 in income. It is important to note that NVDY shareholders do not receive any dividends paid by Nvidia (NVDA) directly. But with these juicy payouts from NVDY, no investor would have missed much. When it comes to NVDA, the math is simple. You’ll need about 10× the cost of an NVDY share to buy one share of NVDA. Sell NVDA in a taxable account, and you’ll owe capital gains taxes on your profits. Sell it in a tax-advantaged account like a 401(k), and those taxes can be pushed to another day. Lower Entry Cost: NVDY trades at roughly one-tenth the price of NVDA stock, making it more accessible for smaller investors. Capital Efficiency: Through its synthetic long position strategy, NVDY can mimic exposure to thousands of dollars’ worth of NVDA stock with a minimal capital outlay. Attractive Yields - NVDY’s covered call strategy generates eye-catching yields, appealing to income-focused investors. NVDA on the other hand is coveted for its growth potential rather than dividends. Faster Capital Recovery: NVDY’s hefty and frequent payouts can help investors achieve “house money” status quickly, recovering their initial investment through distributions. This can substantially de-risk the investment. NVDA requires selling shares to realize profits. Occasional Upside Participation: when NVDA stock is expected to rally in the short-term (because of a sell-off or some positive development) NVDY employs the “Covered Call Spread” strategy, allowing more upside capture versus a standard covered call if NVDA’s price surges. Asymmetric Downside: NVDY’s synthetic long structure caps upside but leaves investors fully exposed to NVDA’s downside. High monthly income may not be able to offset losses from a sharp NVDA correction. Investor Exodus: Significant price drops in NVDY can trigger investor outflows, lowering Assets Under Management (AUM) and making it harder to generate option income efficiently, thereby creating a negative feedback loop. Distribution volatility: While NVDA offers paltry dividends, NVDY’s monthly payouts can fluctuate sharply — largely because they rely on option premium income and include return of capital. When NVDA’s implied volatility drops or NVDY’s Net Asset Value (NAV) erodes from repeated ROC payouts, the ETF’s distributions could shrink. Opportunity Cost: Historically NVDA’s returns have outpaced NVDY’s significantly. Simply holding NVDA stock may generate greater total returns than NVDY, especially during strong bull runs in tech. If you are betting on Nvidia as a core pillar of an AI-driven future, and seek full participation in Nvidia’s growth story — you’re a Growth Chaser — you pick NVDA stock. If you are comfortable with capped upside and prioritize monthly income, you’re an Income Alchemist — you choose NVDY to tactically monetize volatility and generate consistent yield. If you are looking to blend growth and income — gaining exposure to Nvidia’s long-term upside while securing a steady income stream, you hold both: NVDA for capital appreciation and NVDY for monthly payouts. That makes you the Hedged Optimist. Bottom Line In my view, NVDA stock remains the superior play with its compelling long-term returns despite the meager dividend. The NVDA stock has clearly demonstrated resilience by rebounding and reaching new heights after every sharp correction, highlighting its structural strength. On the other hand, NVDY’s low capital requirements, exceptional yield and the potential to recover capital in a reasonable time frame are alluring. However, the risks of asymmetric downside and NAV erosion — potentially shrinking the very dividends investors seek — make NVDY better suited as a tactical, smaller allocation in a portfolio. By contrast, NVDA stock deserves to be a core holding and investors may consider accumulating on any weakness, although past performance is no guarantee for future results.

Intel (INTC) shares surged again Tuesday following a meeting between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and President Donald Trump on Monday. The meeting came after Trump on Fridy demanded the immediate resignation of Tan, calling him "highly conflicted" over investments in Chinese firms. The president late Monday said on this Truth Social platform that the meeting was "very interesting" and that Tan's success is "an amazing story." Trump said that members of his cabinet would continue meeting with Tan in the coming days. Trump’s meeting with the once-storied American chipmaker’s CEO followed news on Monday that AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip revenues to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses. Intel shares were up 5% at $21.75 in late trading Tuesday, adding to the previous session's gain of 3.5%. The stock is up about 9% so far this year, roughly in line with the performance of the S&P 500 in 2025 as investors asses the impact of Tan’s strategic moves, which include divesting assets, reducing employees, and reallocating resources. Tan took over the CEO role in March. Below, we take a closer look at Intel’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down from an ascending channel late last month, Intel shares retraced to a multi-month trading floor before finding buying interest around this key location. More recently, the stock has continued to move higher, though the price remains below the 50- and 200-day moving averages and the relative strength index sits just below its neutral reading. However, it’s worth noting that the shares registered their highest volume in more than two weeks on Monday, indicating growing interest in the chipmaker’s stock. Let’s identify key overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares continue their recent upward momentum and also point out a major support level worth monitoring during future retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $22, currently just above the key moving averages. This location will likely attract significant attention on the chart near a horizontal line that stretches back to last August’s prominent stock gap. A decisive close above this price could see the stock climb to the $24 area. The shares may face selling pressure here near a range of corresponding price action on the chart between September and July. Buying through this area opens the door for a retest of resistance near $26. Investors who have bought the stock at lower prices could look for exit points around major peaks that formed on the chart in November, February and March. During future retracements in Intel’s share price, it’s worth keeping a close eye on the $19 level. This region on the chart would likely provide strong support near multiple troughs that mark the stock’s multi-month trading floor.

Title: Amazon exploiting visa programs to replace U.S. workers

Time Published: 2025-08-12T19:41:20Z

By Amanda Bartolotta August 12, 2025 For the graduates who cannot find jobs and the laid-off tech workers still searching for work, it can feel demeaning to hear Big Tech companies continue to claim there is a labor shortage when, in reality, there are more than enough willing and able Americans ready to step in. The repeated message that there are “no qualified Americans” does more than insult them: It leaves lasting damage that cannot be undone by simply finding new employment. However, Big Tech’s claims do not stand up to actual documented evidence. In fact, Amazon’s own filings with the U.S. Department of Labor comprise a comprehensive record of the company’s immigration submissions. And that data dismantles the “shortage” narrative, revealing a system in which loopholes are used, recruitment requirements minimized and federal certifications freely obtained for foreign labor – even as qualified Americans are sidelined. Between 2009 and 2024, Amazon filed more than 111,000 petitions for H-1B visas, a program intended for positions requiring “specialized knowledge” that cannot be filled by any qualified U.S. workers. Of these filings, 39,012 were new H-1B visa applications, while 72,726 were renewal applications for existing foreign workers. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! In addition to its H-1B activity, Amazon also made extensive use of the Department of Labor’s Program Electronic Review Management, or PERM, process. Between 2020 and 2024, the company filed 21,012 labor certification applications through PERM, an essential step for sponsoring foreign workers for permanent residency in the United States. How does the PERM process work? The PERM program is the first step in sponsoring a foreign worker for a U.S. green card (permanent residence). Before applying, an employer must test the labor market to determine if there are any qualified, willing and available U.S. workers for the job. That is the U.S. Department of Labor’s process for requiring employers to show they made a genuine effort to hire an American before receiving approval to sponsor a foreign worker. Yes, despite Amazon tech jobs being highly sought after by Americans, the company claimed that for all 21,012 roles, no qualified U.S. workers applied – essentially asserting that only the foreign workers they hired were interested in, or qualified for, those positions. Regulation on Qualifications for the Job: The batch advantage: Circumventing the law and regulations to avoid hiring Americans Wage-level “batching” is when a company reuses the same government-issued prevailing wage determination for multiple green card applications instead of getting a fresh wage review for each job. In Amazon’s case, the company obtained only 3,875 wage determinations but used them to file 21,012 applications, allowing Amazon to lock in older, lower wage rates, keep salaries down and push applications through faster while doing less recruitment for each role. About 82% of Amazon’s green card applications reused wage determinations, meaning the vast majority did not have a wage rate specific to that job. How much could Amazon save by paying below-market wages? It’s all about cheaper labor, not skilled labor This estimate is calculated by comparing the true median wages for these roles, sourced from multiple independent wage datasets, to the prevailing wage rates Amazon used when sponsoring green cards. The methodology assumes that for each job level, the difference between the market median and the prevailing wage represents the per-position savings, multiplied by the number of positions at that level. Level 1 wages: $285 million saved Level 2 wages: $434 million saved Level 3 wages: $20 million saved Total estimated savings: Over $739 million These figures are conservative estimates, while the real savings could be significantly higher. Under the prevailing wage system, the “or similarly employed” provision requires employers to use whichever is higher: the local average wage for the occupation or the wage paid to workers in similar roles. In Big Tech, market rates are typically far above local averages. If Amazon had followed this rule as intended, many roles would have been pegged to the higher Big Tech pay scale, not the lower local rate Amazon appears to have used. This suggests Amazon did not apply the provision as required, allowing it to lock in far lower wages than the market rate for similar work in their industry. Department of Labor: Prevailing Wage Information and Resources: While Amazon claims there were no qualified Americans for these roles and that the foreign workers sponsored were on “high-skilled” visas, the overwhelming use of Prevailing Wage Levels 1 and 2 tells a different story. These wage levels are typically reserved for entry-level workers with little or no experience, such as recent college graduates. This means Amazon is either abusing the prevailing wage system or abusing the visa program itself. By sponsoring these workers at entry-level rates, Amazon not only undercuts wages for equivalent American jobs, but also eliminates opportunities for U.S. graduates and early-career professionals. Once these foreign workers obtain permanent residency, they remain permanently in an already oversaturated labor market, further reducing opportunities for Americans. Amazon’s recruitment tactics: Can’t find qualified Americans … or not looking? The lawis clear: When sponsoring a foreign worker for a green card, an employer must recruit in good faith and advertise the job in a way that gives qualified U.S. workers a real, fair chance to apply. The regulations require open, accessible recruitment that mirrors how the company normally hires. Amazon’s approach has undermined that requirement. For example, the company ran vague newspaper ads in the The Seattle Times’ Sunday print edition, sometimes saying the job could be done “anywhere in the U.S.,” but requiring applicants to mail in paper resumes, rather than applying online through Amazon’s own career site. Is this legal? The Department of Justice previously sued Facebook for using similar tactics, resulting in a $14.25 million settlement in 2021. According to the DOJ’s press release about the case: “Facebook routinely reserved jobs for temporary visa holders through the PERM process. Specifically, the lawsuit alleged that, in contrast to its standard recruitment practices, Facebook used recruiting methods designed to deter U.S. workers from applying to certain positions, such as requiring applications to be submitted by mail only.” How 1 little ad was used to give 585 American jobs to foreign workers Recruitment batching is a tactic whereby a company uses a single, minimal recruitment effort, such as one newspaper ad, to satisfy the Department of Labor’s PERM recruitment requirement for hundreds of different jobs at once. Instead of advertising and recruiting separately for each open position, the company “batches” them together under one generic posting, often with vague descriptions and outdated application methods that discourage real applicants. This allows the employer to claim it “tested the labor market” without ever giving qualified Americans a meaningful opportunity to apply. Amazon has used this strategy repeatedly. In one case, the company ran a single ad in the Seattle Times for “multiple positions,” listed no clear skills or experience requirements, claimed the jobs could be done “anywhere in the U.S.,” and required resumes to be postal mailed in, completely bypassing Amazon’s own career website. That single ad was used to justify 585 PERM filings for Software Development Engineer II roles. Similar examples show the scale of batching: This approach violates both the spirit and potentially the letter of the law, both in terms of 20 CFR § 656.10(c) (bona fide job requirements) and 20 CFR § 656.17(e) (good faith recruitment), as well as the BALCA precedent, which has repeatedly held that mail-only applications, generic ads and recycled prevailing wage determinations undermine recruitment integrity. In plain terms, Amazon’s “batching” is not legitimate recruitment, but it has been very successful in avoiding hiring Americans. Regulation on Attestations: Finding that employers placed unjustified hurdles in the path of U.S. applicants in an apparent attempt to discourage their pursuit of the jobs. Out with the Americans. In with the foreign labor During Amazon’s largest reported layoff on Nov. 16, 2022, which affected approximately 10,000 employees, the company submitted 2,341 PERM labor certification applications within the federally protected period designed to prevent the displacement of U.S. workers. On each application, Amazon certified that no qualified U.S. workers were available or considered for the roles, as required by law. Despite the mass layoffs, the Department of Labor approved 2,217 of these applications, authorizing foreign labor for positions that may have been recently held by American workers who had just been terminated. Amazon layoff graphs provided by Red Line Project (Data Source: Department of Labor): Regulations on Layoffs: Amazon’s long-term use of U.S. visa and green card programs reveals a systemic strategy that leverages regulatory gaps to replace American workers with lower-cost foreign labor. Through wage-level manipulation, minimal recruitment efforts and large-scale filings timed alongside layoffs, the company has embedded a foreign labor pipeline deep into its operations while reducing domestic opportunities.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Solana Price Rebound Ignites Buying; Traders Stock Up on Pepe and This L2 Gem with 200x Potential

The recent surge in Solana price has reignited enthusiasm across the meme coin sector, drawing fresh attention to both the established meme coin Pepe and the hot new $LBRETT. As investors seek the next high-yield meme coin, comparisons between Solana’s performance and the rapid ascent of newer tokens like $LBRETT have intensified, especially given the ongoing presale, remarkable staking rewards, and technological advantages on offer. SOL has overcome numerous network challenges to secure its place as a top-tier crypto asset. Its high throughput, low transaction fees, and robust developer ecosystem have cemented its reputation among leading blockchains. SOL Technical indicators such as EMA and MACD signal a bullish continuation, with analysts projecting further Solana price upside in the near term. These positive forecasts are fostering increased interest in meme coins built on newer, more scalable platforms. PEPE, the prominent meme coin, has ridden waves of viral popularity and speculative trading. Despite the absence of major recent price news, its established brand presence continues to attract traders. Technical models for PEPE suggest that it remains a force in the meme coin arena. Its upside potential to explode is still there and has prompted many savvy investors to stock up on it, expecting the meme coin season to start soon. Unlike its rivals, $LBRETT is widely considered to possess the capacity to surpass both SOL and PEPE in terms of price appreciation. Analysts point to the project’s rapid community growth, innovative staking model, and presale momentum as drivers for an anticipated 200x increase from current entry levels. With the presale price rising at each round, even the current $0.004 price tag is still deeply discounted. The upside potential is drawing significant attention from both seasoned and new investors. Industry experts are predicting 200x not on hot hair, but are basing this on facts. The live presale has already raised over $190,000, underscoring rising demand. Available for immediate staking, the $LBRETT APY is exceptionally high, even though it has dropped significantly from its original 25,000%. The falling reward has created a stir in the market, with traders rushing to join and take advantage of the APY before it is too late. Layer Brett leverages high-speed, low-cost, and scalable infrastructure, benefiting from the security of Ethereum’s smart contract ecosystem and enabling fast transactions with very low gas fees. Here are just a few things that combine meme power and actual utility: With Solana price action invigorating the meme coin markets, both Pepe and $LBRETT are capturing investor interest. However, $LBRETT’s combination of explosive meme attraction, exceptional staking rewards, Layer 2 Ethereum technology, and innovative features positions it as the meme coin most likely to achieve the coveted 200x potential.Don’t Miss Out On Crypto’s Newest 100x Meme!

August 12, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Crunchyroll Announces Layoffs Amid Global Reorganization

By Jamie Lang | 08/12/2025 8:11 am | Be the First to Comment! Email Address* A day after unveiling a major deal with Delta Airlines, Crunchyroll has announced a sweeping internal reorganization that includes layoffs in the U.S., new global engineering hubs, and role changes for staff. In a letter to employees, published by Variety, president Rahul Purini framed the shake-up as a proactive step to position the anime streamer for “scale and success” over the next three to five years. The changes include the creation of “centers of excellence” in the U.S., India, and Mexico, along with a shift toward regionally empowered teams. Purini stressed the move was “not a cost-cutting measure or driven by financial performance,” but rather part of a strategy to lean more deeply into anime fandom worldwide. The announcement comes amid a period of both rapid growth and mounting challenges for the Sony-owned platform. Since Sony Group Corp. bought Crunchyroll in 2021 for $1.2 billion, subscribers to its service have tripled to 15 million, and the number of new shows released each quarter has doubled. But the rising popularity of anime has brought fierce competition from the likes of Netflix, Disney, and Amazon, driving up licensing costs and making it harder for Crunchyroll to hold onto its corner of the market. Internally, the company has undergone at least three rounds of layoffs since the Sony acquisition, with staff surveys showing declining confidence in leadership. According to internal polling shared by Bloomberg, only 39% of employees recently agreed that management communicates a motivating strategy, down from 51% in a prior survey. Some current and former staffers have described the post-acquisition leadership, many from Sony’s Funimation division, as “out-of-touch” with anime fans and culture. Crunchyroll has also faced strategic setbacks. Its “25 by 25” initiative, aiming for 25 million subscribers by the end of 2025, appears increasingly out of reach. Plans to drive growth through video games and e-commerce have stumbled, with several game titles shuttered and its Right Stuf merchandise business shrinking since Sony removed adult products that had contributed to sales. Competition for top anime titles has intensified. Other top streamers have secured exclusives for key IPs such as Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, Tokyo Revengers, and Delicious in Dungeon, while major Japanese studios such as Toei and Toho have explored partnerships beyond Crunchyroll. At the same time, industry sources say rising licensing fees are squeezing margins. Despite the turbulence, Crunchyroll is pursuing new markets, offering subscriptions in India for about $1 a month, expanding dubbing into multiple local languages, and creating free, ad-supported channels on platforms like Roku and Pluto TV. The new Delta Airlines partnership, announced just a day before the layoffs, will bring over 50,000 episodes of anime to in-flight screens later this year, marking a high-profile bid to expand the brand’s reach. Whether the restructuring will stabilize internal morale and sharpen Crunchyroll’s competitive positioning remains to be seen. For now, the company’s message is one of optimism: doubling down on fandom, investing in regional teams, and betting that its blend of exclusive titles, events, and merchandise can keep pace with an increasingly crowded anime streaming market.

Title: This ‘Buffett Favorite’ Dividend Is An Incredible CEF Bargain (For Now)
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/08/12/this-buffett-favorite-dividend-is-an-incredible-cef-bargain-for-now/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T14:44:00Z

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. When it comes to a closed-end fund (CEF), many investors are always focused on one thing: the dividend. It makes sense: CEFs pay 8.5% yields, on average, according to data from my CEF Insider service. But sometimes it pays to look beyond those big payouts, because by doing so, you could find a CEF with a track record so strong that its total return (dividends and gains combined) beats that of a CEF with a high yield. I don’t know about you, but I’m willing to take more of my return in the form of price gains if it means, say, doubling my money in five years! That’s been the case with the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), whose dividend—at 3.8%—is pretty, well, meh, for a CEF. As a result, it’s often overlooked, which is what’s happening now. We can see that in the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), which is just under 20% today (more on this shortly). That ridiculous discount is an insult to this proven fund, which has doubled an investor’s money, with dividends reinvested, in the last half-decade. That’s a fantastic return by any measure. It even beat the S&P 500, which is up around 103% since then. The funny thing is, the strategy behind this money-making fund is simple, which is why its bargain valuation is so surprising. Inspired by Warren Buffett, STEW uses a value-investing approach that makes the fund less volatile than the broader market while helping it rise in value over the long haul. Its largest investment is in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which is about 45% of the fund’s assets. Additionally, STEW looks for valuable underpriced stocks, which is why it also holds JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), Microsoft (MSFT) and other high-quality firms with long histories of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This is all good stuff, but now let me show you the best part: that bargain valuation I mentioned a second ago. This is where a big difference between CEFs and ETFs comes in: ETFs can issue shares as necessary, so they don’t trade at discounts (or at least significant ones). But STEW, as a CEF, has a fixed number of shares (hence the “closed” in the term “closed-end fund”). As a result, a CEF’s shares can trade up or down depending on market demand, in addition to their movements on the value of the fund’s assets. That, in turn, means CEFs can sometimes trade well below NAV. And STEW’s discount, as I mentioned a second ago, is truly massive: just under 20%! Note that this markdown was even wider in recent months. In fact, STEW’s discount has slowly grown larger over the last five years despite the fact that the fund beat the market. This inefficiency can’t last, which is why STEW’s discount suddenly shrank in recent weeks. Its discount is likely to shrink further as more investors catch on. All of this might sound familiar if you’ve been reading my articles for a while, because in a March 31, 2025, piece, I pointed out that STEW’s massive (then 23.1%) discount was unlikely to last. It has shrunk a bit since then, and I see it shrinking more. Now, let me wheel back to the dividend part of the picture here. To be sure, that 3.8% payout is, as mentioned, on the small side for a CEF. But it’s also masking something else, besides STEW’s strong total return: dividend growth. That too has been strong, with the payout soaring 62% in the last five years. And lately, STEW’s payout growth has been accelerating: It’s just another reason why with CEFs (or any income investment, really), it pays to look beyond the yield.

Title: This ‘Buffett Favorite’ Dividend Is An Incredible CEF Bargain (For Now)

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. When it comes to a closed-end fund (CEF), many investors are always focused on one thing: the dividend. It makes sense: CEFs pay 8.5% yields, on average, according to data from my CEF Insider service. But sometimes it pays to look beyond those big payouts, because by doing so, you could find a CEF with a track record so strong that its total return (dividends and gains combined) beats that of a CEF with a high yield. I don’t know about you, but I’m willing to take more of my return in the form of price gains if it means, say, doubling my money in five years! That’s been the case with the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), whose dividend—at 3.8%—is pretty, well, meh, for a CEF. As a result, it’s often overlooked, which is what’s happening now. We can see that in the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), which is just under 20% today (more on this shortly). That ridiculous discount is an insult to this proven fund, which has doubled an investor’s money, with dividends reinvested, in the last half-decade. That’s a fantastic return by any measure. It even beat the S&P 500, which is up around 103% since then. The funny thing is, the strategy behind this money-making fund is simple, which is why its bargain valuation is so surprising. Inspired by Warren Buffett, STEW uses a value-investing approach that makes the fund less volatile than the broader market while helping it rise in value over the long haul. Its largest investment is in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which is about 45% of the fund’s assets. Additionally, STEW looks for valuable underpriced stocks, which is why it also holds JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), Microsoft (MSFT) and other high-quality firms with long histories of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This is all good stuff, but now let me show you the best part: that bargain valuation I mentioned a second ago. This is where a big difference between CEFs and ETFs comes in: ETFs can issue shares as necessary, so they don’t trade at discounts (or at least significant ones). But STEW, as a CEF, has a fixed number of shares (hence the “closed” in the term “closed-end fund”). As a result, a CEF’s shares can trade up or down depending on market demand, in addition to their movements on the value of the fund’s assets. That, in turn, means CEFs can sometimes trade well below NAV. And STEW’s discount, as I mentioned a second ago, is truly massive: just under 20%! Note that this markdown was even wider in recent months. In fact, STEW’s discount has slowly grown larger over the last five years despite the fact that the fund beat the market. This inefficiency can’t last, which is why STEW’s discount suddenly shrank in recent weeks. Its discount is likely to shrink further as more investors catch on. All of this might sound familiar if you’ve been reading my articles for a while, because in a March 31, 2025, piece, I pointed out that STEW’s massive (then 23.1%) discount was unlikely to last.

Title: How deals with Apple and Trump’s Pentagon turned rare earth miner MP Materials into a red-hot stock
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/12/rare-earths-magnets-mp-materials-stock-surge-landmark-deals-trump-apple/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jordan Blum is the Energy editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of a growing global energy sector for oil and gas, transition businesses, renewables, and critical minerals. California miner MP Materials struck metaphorical gold in July when it announced a landmark deal with the Trump administration to make the Defense Department its largest shareholder, followed up days later by an expansion agreement with Apple. But what MP actually mines—so-called rare earth elements that are central to many of the world’s most important technologies—appears to be even more precious than gold to investors. MP is the nation’s only rare earths miner, at a time when the U.S. aspires to compete against China’s supply-chain dominance in the field. Its share price has spiked an astonishing 365% year to date, including a 150% surge in just over a month. MP’s market cap has risen from just over $2 billion to $13 billion, entering large-cap territory—not bad for a company that brought in just $204 million in revenue last year. It’s a rise comparable to that of Silicon Valley defense firm Palantir—but with all due respect to that AI-fueled company, Palantir’s stock has risen by only 140% year to date. “I give MP credit for having the foresight and for being in the right place at the right time,” Ben Kallo, Baird senior research analyst, told Fortune. “I think it’s surprising because I didn’t believe the government would react in such a quick and forceful way. “I think the fire is in the belly of supply-chain managers to move away from China right now.” MP also is the nation’s only vertically integrated miner and specialty magnets producer, having just opened a metals and neodymium magnets plant in Fort Worth. Not one to miss a marketing opportunity, MP named that plant “Independence.” The powerful magnets are as critically important as they are little-known. They are used in electric vehicles, renewable energy, mobile phones, military equipment, and, most recently, AI data centers. General Motors was MP’s first flagship customer for magnets. From a military standpoint, the magnets are just as crucial: They’re used in drones, fighter jets, missile systems, and nuclear submarines. More than 80% of the world’s neodymium magnet supply is manufactured in China. The U.S. counts a few manufacturers, while China has a few hundred. “Rare earth” materials actually are not rare, but they are expensive to separate and refine. That growth takes financial support. The Defense Department bought $400 million worth of MP shares in July to become a 15% shareholder; on Aug. 10, it backed up its initial deal with an additional $150 million loan to MP to help expand its mining operations in Mountain Pass, Calif. “We are taking decisive action to restore our domestic critical minerals supply chain, revive our industrial base, and rebuild our military to achieve President Trump’s goal of peace through strength,” said Emil Michael, defense undersecretary for research and engineering, in a statement. Michael is a former top executive at Uber. Even apart from the military, both MP and the administration see the company growing because of the AI boom. “We have the platform, the partners, and the perspective to seize another enormous runway of opportunity,” said MP founder, chairman, and CEO James Litinsky on the company’s Aug. 7 earnings call. “And it does not hurt that we have a front-row seat and an important role in what may well become the most significant business transformation of our generation, the era of physical AI.” MP is built on the ashes of the former mine owner Molycorp and its Mountain Pass facilities. A decade ago, Molycorp was failing because of heavy indebtedness and China’s price dumping into the global rare earths markets. Seeing the thesis case for domestic rare earths mining, Litinsky and his eponymously named JHL Capital Group hedge fund bought into Molycorp’s bonds during its 2015 bankruptcy proceedings. Litinsky eventually folded his fund to buy the Mountain Pass assets outright and form MP Materials in 2017. Litinsky had previously worked at the New York–based Fortress Investment Group, and MP Materials went public in 2020 when it merged with one of Fortress’s several special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, in a $1.47 billion deal. “One of the biggest question marks and pushback was, ‘How can these finance guys operate a mine and make it work?’” Kallo said. But MP cleaned up its mining operations, kept debt low, and focused on vertical integration and growth. “They’ve surprised to the upside.” The Independence plant opened in January, and MP was looking at a smoother growth trajectory. But in the spring, the onslaught of Trump’s tariff war shook things up, and companies began to realize they shouldn’t rely on Chinese supply chains so heavily. “A lot of companies didn’t realize their magnets came from China,” Kallo said. “It woke a lot of people up. These magnets go into everything.” This is when the Wall Street–ization of the Defense Department under the second Trump administration came into play. Steve Feinberg, the new U.S. deputy secretary of defense, is the billionaire cofounder of Cerberus Capital Management. Feinberg spearheaded the unusual, landmark deal with Litinsky. It not only made the Pentagon a 15% shareholder, it included the pledge of a multibillion-dollar total investment as MP aims to expand its magnet production capacity 10-fold. That expansion is expected to be completed in 2028. The deal also puts a floor on pricing for MP’s rare earth materials for 10 years, helping offset the possibility of foreign price dumping. A Defense Department spokesperson told Fortune: “Rebuilding the critical minerals and rare earth magnet sectors of the U.S. industrial base won’t happen overnight, but DOD is taking immediate action to streamline processes and identify opportunities to strengthen critical minerals production.” Four days after the Pentagon deal announcement, on July 15, MP announced a $500 million partnership with Apple to supply rare earth magnets that are fully manufactured from recycled materials, a pledge that would entail recycling expansions at both the Mountain Pass and Fort Worth facilities. MP and Apple had piloted advanced recycling technologies for five years before announcing the deal. “American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.” MP used to ship more of its raw materials to China because of a lack of U.S. refining capacity. One potential stumbling block for MP was its smaller ownership stake still held by China’s Shenghe Resources, which had helped Litinsky buy out Molycorp in 2017. But the larger U.S. government ownership position combined with the new pricing floor and Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports has allowed MP to cease its exports to China as of April. “We are maniacally focused on investing and executing in the United States of America,” Litinsky said on his earnings call. He emphasized, “Through years of relentless execution, this team has transformed a bankrupted and abandoned mine site into a vertically integrated American national champion with a strategic and economic platform that matters.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Tesla’s Stock's Next Surge: 4 Catalysts To Watch

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) has encountered a challenging year in 2025, marked by political conflicts, declining sales, and increasing competition. Nonetheless, it might not be entirely bleak for Tesla, as a series of new catalysts could be rejuvenating the stock’s long-term bullish outlook. With opportunities presented by AI and a favorable cost structure in a changing tariff environment, Tesla is regaining the attention of investors, and its shares have appreciated nearly 6% in the last five trading days. While valuations remain high at approximately 195x forward earnings, the narrative might be shifting in favor of Tesla. Here’s a brief overview of the positive factors fostering optimism in the stock. Elon Musk’s significant and very visible discord with President Donald Trump, following a brief political alliance during the 2024 campaign and initial months of the Trump presidency, created uncertainty regarding Tesla’s regulatory outlook. However, public sentiment seems to be changing. Recently, Trump has softened his rhetoric, stating, “I desire for Elon’s business to thrive,” and has generally been more lenient towards his friend-turned-adversary. While there are still policy risks, a more amicable relationship could alleviate a major burden. In addition, Elon Musk is back in charge at Tesla after a temporary stay in Washington, now fully concentrating on Tesla’s mission – enhancing EV production, launching robotaxis, and envisioning AI-powered robotics. Tesla has recently communicated to its shareholders a new compensation agreement for Musk, which includes 96 million restricted shares valued potentially at nearly $30 billion, contingent on ambitious performance targets. This indicates that Musk is directly motivated to provide substantial returns for shareholders. However, investing in a single stock carries considerable risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio is intended to mitigate stock-specific risk while still offering upside potential. AI computing has been the most significant trend in the technology sector over the past three years, driving valuations to unmatched levels. Nvidia is now valued at nearly $4.5 trillion and Broadcom around $1.5 trillion, primarily due to the demand for AI computing infrastructure. Just as AI computing became the foundational component for the digital AI explosion, “physical AI” might emerge as the next significant opportunity. We believe that the markets could be beginning to perceive Tesla as a type of proxy for physical AI. The company uniquely integrates cutting-edge software, advanced hardware, and extensive manufacturing know-how – three essential elements for leading this budding sector. Tesla’s extensive experience in autonomous driving has provided it with a substantial advantage in AI software, its robotics proficiency is deeply ingrained in its highly automated factories, and its vertical integration ensures oversight from chip design to final assembly. Besides self-driving vehicles, Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot designed to carry out repetitive, hazardous, or mundane tasks in factories, warehouses, and homes, could represent a significant revenue stream for Tesla. The goal for Tesla is to mass-produce millions of units annually by 2030 at a price point below $20,000, thus opening a new market with immense potential. Unlike many small robotics startups, Tesla possesses the financial resources, engineering expertise, and manufacturing capacity to transition from prototype to mass production. Check the analysis on How Tesla stock soars to $1500 While Tesla’s deliveries declined by 13.5% to 384,122 vehicles in Q2, investors seem to be overlooking this drop. Recent regulatory alterations under the Trump Administration, which are generally viewed as detrimental for the automotive industry, might actually benefit Tesla. A 25% tariff on all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks was implemented in April 2025, followed by tariffs on specific imported auto components in May. Tesla could emerge as a net winner, building all U.S. vehicles in California and Texas, thereby avoiding these tariffs, while competitors such as GM and Ford manufacture some EVs in Mexico and may incur higher costs. As these tariffs ripple through the supply chain, Tesla’s price competitiveness could enhance, aiding it in defending and expanding its U.S. market share. Furthermore, although the federal electric vehicle mandate has been eliminated, Tesla’s standing as one of the lowest-cost EV manufacturers remains solid, giving it an edge over other competitors who may have leaned more heavily to compensate for a higher cost structure. The company’s prudent management of fixed costs, including R&D and SG&A, has allowed it to maintain profitability even in tough market conditions. Also see: Will Slowing Cloud Business drag Amazon stock to $100? One of the most exciting prospects for Tesla could be its robotaxi service. Admittedly, Tesla will need to catch up to Google's Waymo, which has been providing autonomous rides in several cities for nearly five years. Nevertheless, Tesla has several advantages. The company manages the entire process: it manufactures the EVs, develops the software, and runs the charging infrastructure. Additionally, it has a large fleet of vehicles already on the road that can be integrated into its robotaxi service. In contrast, Waymo's vehicles are significantly more expensive, with modifications necessary for self-driving estimated to cost as much as $100,000. This gives Tesla a considerable advantage. Tesla has now secured a ride-share license in Texas, paving the way for its autonomous robotaxi service to function under the state’s new self-driving laws alongside established competitors like Uber and Lyft. The ride-hailing market is already substantial. Uber managed over 230 million rides weekly in Q4 2024 alone. At approximately $30 per ride, this equates to a $375 billion annual revenue pool, and that’s just for human-driven rides. Autonomous rides could potentially yield even more – possibly reaching $750 billion annually. This represents a significant revenue opportunity for Tesla. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What is the reason for this? As a collective, the HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a much more stable experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: OpenAI and SpaceX are making it big without an IPO. That's bad news for young investors.

Ed Elson, a 26-year-old research analyst and co-host of the Prof G Markets podcast, has heard plenty of stories about generations before him getting rich on stocks. His own co-host, New York University business school professor and entrepreneur Scott Galloway, who's 60, invested $800,000 in both Apple and Amazon back in 2009. Today, those investments total $40 million, a cornerstone of his $150 million net worth. Elson wants the same opportunity to invest in the tech companies defining his generation. He sees those chances in OpenAI and SpaceX, standout innovators that have soared to valuations of $300 billion or more. The problem? Both companies are private. OpenAI and SpaceX top a growing class of companies making it big without the public markets. Rather than expose themselves to public market scrutiny and quarterly earnings pressures, these companies are raising round after round of fresh funds from venture capital firms. Over the last 10 years, global startup funding has more than tripled, with VC investments projected to hit $400 billion this year, according to data from PitchBook. "The people who have access to the highest quality companies that are creating the most amount of value, i.e., OpenAI and SpaceX, are the people in VC who are already rich," Elson said. "That's a big problem for our generation." Seduced by fabulous success stories like Galloway's, and empowered by the proliferation of digital trading platforms plus the investing advice on platforms like TikTok, Zoomers have become a generation of investors. The average Gen Z investor starts trading at 19 years old, compared to baby boomers' typical kickoff at 35 years old. But there's also a gnawing sense that Gen Z missed out on the boom times. And they're not entirely wrong. The public markets now offer fewer stocks to choose from and higher price tags. Companies are waiting 14 years on average to go public, Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida's Warrington School of Business, has found. More private companies are valued in the tens and even hundreds of billions, a feat usually reserved for public companies. In 2025, an IPO is less a promise of what's to come for a company and more a signal that you've already missed out on its biggest gains. That shift has more investors setting their sights on secondary markets, where stock purchases of private companies are limited to traders accredited by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. And whereas the public markets are open to anyone with a brokerage account, just 13% of Americans qualify for that accreditation. "It almost feels like a private members-only club," says Vivian Tu, the 31-year-old personal finance educator behind 'Your Rich BFF.' "If you're already rich, you can invest in this stuff, and if you're not, sucks to suck. You're locked out of the club." Those rules aren't sitting well with Gen Z investors. Warren Buffett famously advised traders to invest in what they know. That's what Galloway did back in 2009 when he bought shares in Apple. The iPhone was still relatively new, but it was clear the technology was a game changer. He could get in relatively early and profit from the stock's exponential rise as Apple built on the momentum of its spectacular innovation. These days, some of the most exciting tech companies innovate without needing to IPO. Elson points to OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in 2022, which drew 1 million users in 5 days. "If we were living in the 1980s, there's a very, very high likelihood that OpenAI would've been public at that point," Elson says. Investors would have said: "Oh my God, this is an incredible tool. I want to buy some stock." But most investors were frozen out. In March, OpenAI was valued at $300 billion — a 900% spike in two years. The major beneficiaries included Microsoft, VC megafirm Sequoia Capital, and tech billionaire Peter Thiel. The critique that the public markets don't create enough value for mom and pop investors is virtually as old as public markets themselves. But the markets hit an inflection point in 2021 when a record 1,035 IPOs, raising a staggering $286 billion, were followed by an abrupt collapse. Investors, desperate for liquidity, began turning more to secondary markets to sell portions of their stakes. If companies can raise plenty of capital while keeping their investors happy, that has increasingly allowed them to put off their IPOs indefinitely. "It's pretty simple: Why go public if you have access to all the benefits while staying private?" says Deedy Das, a principal at Menlo Ventures. Das sums up the thinking of top-dollar startups this way: "I have all this administrative burden off my shoulders; I don't have to have that predictable revenue; I can take riskier bets; I don't have to explain to retail investors what my vision is. I can just run my business." With so much pent-up demand, it's been extraordinarily expensive for retail investors to get in when a hot company finally goes public. Take Figma, the design software maker, and its recent red-hot IPO. When it debuted in July, Figma's stock opened at $85 a share, more than double its $33-a-share IPO price. Since the overwhelming majority of IPO shares were allocated to institutional investors and not retail investors — which is typical for public listings — most retail investors paid a significant premium. At the end of the day, the frenzy had sent Figma's valuation soaring to more than 60 times its revenue in the biggest first-day jump for a multibillion-dollar tech company in decades. By the first week of August, however, Figma had shed billions of dollars in market value as the stock came back down to earth, leaving many of those same retail investors holding the bag. As of August 11, Figma's stock was valued less than its opening day price, meaning any retail investor who backed the company on its first day of trading has since lost money. Institutions that bought in at the IPO price, on the other hand, are holding stock that's still worth more than double what they paid for it. Of course, there are still plenty of public companies creating massive wealth for shareholders. Palantir's stock has surged over 1,800% since it began trading in 2020. Circle's shares have jumped 140% above their opening price in the crypto company's June IPO, though the stock has fluctuated wildly in that period. The public markets are still broadly considered the best place for companies to get returns to their employees and investors, since their liquid nature allows shareholders to cash out anytime. But the biggest stock gains will always be reserved for the savvy investor who spots a big opportunity early. And increasingly, these opportunities are not in the public markets. Lots of investors — including Zoomers like Elson — want in on the action happening on secondary markets. "Because of this dynamic where great companies have no incentive to go public, giving access to retail is heavily in our generation's financial interest," Elson said. While this might present bigger opportunities, it also carries significant risks. It's galling to retail investors that there's so much private company stock floating around — but they can't get to it. Getting your hands on private stocks generally means buying them from early investors that hold large chunks of equity or from early employees, who got stock as part of their compensation agreements. These so-called secondary sales generally must be approved by, if not facilitated by, the startup itself. And not a lot of companies, OpenAI included, are inclined to allow their employees or investors to sell shares on secondary platforms. In an attempt to democratize access to private company equity, platforms like EquityZen, Forge Global and Hiive, which broker secondary investments into pre-IPO companies, are picking up steam. UBS projects the secondary market will hit a record-breaking $180 billion this year, up from $156 billion in secondary transactions in 2024. EquityZen, which launched in 2013, says its user base has doubled in the past year; more than 770,000 individual investors and institutions are now registered on the marketplace. The company says it has brokered secondary sales for companies like Circle and Omada Health before their IPOs, as well as other startups that still haven't gone public, like Impossible Foods. The company wouldn't comment on whether it's facilitated any deals with OpenAI or SpaceX. These deals tend to be costlier than regular trading. Most secondary market platforms charge fees, often 5% of the sale, and require investors to put up anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000 or more to participate. The bigger catch is that not just anyone can access these platforms. On most major secondary platforms, investors must meet the SEC's stringent bar for accreditation: a net worth of over $1 million, excluding their primary residence, or a salary of at least $200,000 for the past two years and the expectation of earning that same income again. The SEC says the rule was set up to protect retail investors, who tend to underperform the broader market with their stock picks. These investors are generally advised to back index funds over individual stocks to minimize the chance of catastrophic losses. The private markets are even more risky since, without disclosure requirements, private deals can obscure key details about a startup's operations and pricing. But the requirement has been criticized by some as paternalistic, particularly amid surging activity on the private markets. After all, Americans can engage in plenty of high-risk activities with their money, from gambling to cryptocurrency investing to prediction market betting, with little to no regulation. "In a world in which anyone can invest in any meme coin they want, how reasonable is it that you're not allowed to invest in startups?" said Peter Walker, head of insights at Carta, a software platform that helps private companies manage their cap tables. In June, the US House of Representatives passed the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, which would allow investors who passed a financial literacy test to qualify for accreditation, paving the way for them to make private market bets. The Senate isn't yet scheduled to review the bill, however, and President Donald Trump has not said if he would support it. In a burgeoning market with minimal oversight, the stakes are high. Linqto, once a prominent marketplace for pre-IPO shares, declared bankruptcy in July. The SEC is currently investigating claims that the platform sold securities to non-accredited investors and charged its users excessive margins. The company told BI it had also discovered "serious defects" in the business "that raise questions about what customers actually own." It's unclear whether the thousands of investors who locked their cash away in Linqto will ever see that money again. Linqto said it's working with an unsecured creditors committee in its bankruptcy proceedings to develop a plan to reorganize the company and "maximize value for customers." As for getting a piece of OpenAI or SpaceX, a few financial firms are creating workarounds. In one example, exchange-traded funds like the ERShares Private-Public Crossover ETF can buy stakes in top private companies, and retail traders can buy those ETFs on the public markets. In December, the fund announced that SpaceX had become its top holding. But without regular public disclosures of SpaceX's finances, investors can only guess at the company's real-time value. In Europe, where SEC regulations don't apply, the stock trading app Robinhood has sold blockchain "tokens" of OpenAI and SpaceX stock. The tokens attempt to mirror the price of stocks without actually giving retail traders any stake in the company. Last month, OpenAI posted a statement on X saying the company had not partnered with Robinhood and that the tokens "are not OpenAI equity." Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explained the app's approach in an interview with Bloomberg last month. "One of the biggest opportunities and also a big tragedy is that private markets are where the bulk of the interesting appreciation and exposure is nowadays," he said. "It's a shame that it's so difficult to get exposure in the US. We're obviously working to solve that." Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at the IPO-focused firm Renaissance Capital, says it's perfectly understandable that the market's slowdown may be frustrating to new investors. Back in 2021, new subscribers to the firm's newsletter asked one question more than any other: How can I invest in pre-IPO companies? "There's this sense that, at the IPO, it's already too late. They want to get in on the ground floor," Kennedy said. But the firm advises investors to "be careful what you wish for." "Yes, you're not going to get that $20-million-in-annual-sales, fast-growing tech company that could be a behemoth," Kennedy said. "But you're also not going to get those less established companies without a solid track record. There's more margin of safety with a company that has $100 million or more in revenue." Barry Ritholtz, the founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, echoed that sentiment. "A private company like OpenAI comes along, and suddenly people are salivating and getting FOMO and saying, I could pick the next one," Ritholtz said. "History tells us, the odds are you cannot." Many young investors see those risks as worth taking — if not for the potential financial upside, then for the crash course in market literacy. Juliette Richert, a senior associate at The Artemis Fund, has made three angel investments since joining the fund three years ago. Richert, who's now 26, says she hasn't seen any returns yet. Even if she never does, she thinks those bets were valuable opportunities for her early investment learnings. "Can I burn the money for the sake of learning something rather than anticipating any specific return?" she said. "For early investors like myself, I think that's a really healthy way to go about it." It's the Gen Z way. Rather than follow well-trodden paths of previous generations, Gen Z investors are determined to pounce on opportunities where they find them and seize their financial destinies. "There's this desire for control and autonomy, the 'American dynamism' mindset: make your own way, versus depending on the system," Richert said. Throw in prediction markets, fractional real estate, and collectibles from sports cards to sneakers, and it's clear that Gen Z isn't just investing differently — they're redefining what "investing" even means. "Young people are smart," Galloway said in conversation with Elson on a recent episode of their podcast. "They said, you know what, fuck this. I can't buy a home. Stocks are crazy expensive. So what am I going to do? I'm going to create my own asset classes. And I'm going to create my own volatility."

Hear from execs at The New York Times, Thomson Reuters, Trusted Media Brands and many others This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → If you’re reading this, you’ll likely have seen at least some of the latest financial results posted by the ad tech sector’s coterie of publicly listed companies, with AppLovin and The Trade Desk leading the pack in earnings (see below). Both companies, talismans of independent ad tech, saw their stock prices dip in early hours after issuing Q2 earnings — despite reporting a 77% and 19% annual increase in revenues, respectively.In The Trade Desk’s case, this included an immediate 30% plunge. The declines were tied to “the narrative,” with analysts deeming guidance remarks underwhelming. AppLovin retained its lead as top earner, with The Trade Desk, now in the S&P 500, nearing $700 million in revenue for the period. Indies eye gains from Google’s troubles and walled garden retreat A common thread across several earnings was the potential to benefit from Google’s mounting legal troubles with the Justice Department. The week began with news that OpenX is seeking compensation for Google’s anticompetitive actions as part of an ongoing ad tech antitrust case. Meanwhile, Magnite leadership expressed similar concerns during their Q2 earnings call (see above). In a Q&A after The Trade Desk’s August 7 earnings call, CEO Jeff Green said these trials are creating opportunity for independent ad tech as marketers grow wary of Google and other Big Tech platforms. Green noted “the supply-side demand imbalance” favoring “the open internet” over walled gardens like Amazon, Google, and Meta. “Consumers spend more of their time in the premium open internet than they do inside of walled gardens,” he said, adding that walled gardens have an inherent conflict of interest. “I believe TTD and the open internet have a bigger TAM than Facebook has… Our goal is to buy the entire open Internet objectively for buyers.” He also claimed, “As Google and Facebook have largely abandoned the open internet, The Trade Desk is the largest source of third-party demand for many publishers around the world.” Profit trumps transparency in adland and finance While investors punished perceived weak growth forecasts, they appeared forgiving of structural flaws in the ecosystem. Several high-profile criticisms of the cohort barely registered in analyst questioning across calls. The last 12 months have been turbulent for the sector, with short-sellers targeting multiple companies, including AppLovin and Zeta Global, causing stock price volatility. Yet Q2 results suggest advertisers largely ignored these claims. In Q1, AppLovin’s stock fell 20% after Muddy Waters alleged unethical data use, prompting a rare off-calendar defense from leadership. In Q2 disclosures, executives emphasized plans to drive advertiser growth via AI and greater adoption of its self-serve platform, reducing reliance on sales or product teams. It also aims to expand internationally so its customer base is evenly split between the U.S. and global markets. With a Q4 rollout, AppLovin is targeting SMBs, expanding beyond in-app into broader web and e-commerce. CEO Adam Foroughi said testing has brought in hundreds of advertisers, “The new type of platform that comes to our platform is extremely incremental to our business… We expect that will increase the advertiser count quite quickly, and also allow us to go through live examples of advertisers coming in self-service [and then] all the way to scale on our product.” Despite revenues of $1.2 billion, up 77% year-over-year and beating expectations, AppLovin’s stock still fell 7% after the announcement — a sign of investors’ counterintuitive moves. Earlier in the week, Zeta Global, which faced short-seller reports late last year, posted similarly strong results. Earnings rose 35% year-over-year to exceed $300 million, signaling client confidence despite prior allegations. Analysts focused more on Zeta’s competitive positioning, particularly with agencies under pressure to develop high-margin software tools. Also under scrutiny in 2025 have been ad measurement and brand safety giants DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science. Both reported Q2 growth: DoubleVerify at $198 million, up 21% year-over-year, and IAS at $149.2 million, up 16%. These gains came despite reports highlighting brand safety shortcomings. In March, Adalytics alleged DoubleVerify and IAS failed to block ads to declared bots despite advertisers paying for pre-bid bot filtration, and routinely allowed general invalid traffic, implying advertisers were misled about protection levels. This followed an earlier report claiming both allowed ads on sites with child abuse content, triggering a class-action suit against DoubleVerify. The company has responded with its own defamation case against Adalytics. Despite the controversy, revenue momentum and advertiser contracts appear to be sustaining both companies. On DoubleVerify’s August 5 call, leadership highlighted rising activity in social and CTV — up 14% and 45% annually, respectively — while fielding questions about relevance as the open web wanes. CEO Mark Zargorski, discussing AI’s rise, said, “So many of the AI solutions don’t include a lot of transparency on what’s going on… That’s part of our role, to drive transparency and open up that black box a bit.” He added that value remains strong among customers on Meta and other platforms using AI tools “without a lot of transparency or clarity on how we’re getting there.” LiveRamp also posted results for the quarter ending June 30 — “Q1 2026” in its reporting. Revenue rose 11% year-over-year to $195 million. Guidance for the next quarter was $197 million, with a full-year forecast of up to $818 million. “Google went from organizing the world’s information to stealing it, taking a sledgehammer to the implied contract the open web has relied on for so long.” –Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO, in a blog post explaining how his company has removed 40,000 pages of its financial content from the reach of Google and other AI search engines. Instead, this content will now be exclusively available to logged-in WalletHub users. Future of TV Briefing: 5 reasons CTV’s ROI comes up short for advertisers Despite the hype, CTV is still not the miracle media channel for advertisers. The reason? It’s still impossible to justify the costs, according to UM Worldwide chief investment officer Marcy Greenberger. ‘You can nullify the effects of what looks like change’: OpenX CEO John Gentry on its legal quarrel with Google After filing legal papers citing Google’s alleged misdeeds to subvert and dominate the online display ad ecosystem, notably in the Eastern District of Virginia, the same jurisdiction where the biggest company in advertising is doing battle with the Justice Department, seeking damages, and adding to calls for a structural remedy. Omnicom’s Samardzija To Join Stagwell In The Fall After Digiday first covered news of a pending leadership shakeup at Omnicom Media Group, with the pending exit of Annalect CEO Slavi Samardzija, it has subsequently been announced that he will join independent media agency Stagwell, with precise details of his role yet to be confirmed. The State of Digital, 2025, by LUMA Partners The macroeconomic environment improved throughout 2024, but uncertainty over the tariff policies to be enacted by the current U.S. administration caused market instability. Despite this, digital ad spend has rebounded, and AI is now considered a fundamental requirement for marketers, with the amount of mergers and acquisitions in the space experiencing a notable uptick in the opening quarter of 2025. More Like No Yield: A New Book Explores How Google Soaked Up The Web’s Ad Profits AdExchanger’s James Hercher sums up Ari Paparo’s book, “Yield: how Google bought, built and bullied its way to advertising dominance.” It features a host of familiar names such as Stephanie Layser, Jana Meron, Brian O’Kelley, Michael Barrett, Michael Rubenstein and many other industry leaders play prominent roles, all of whom help chronicle how Google ingested DoubleClick, and later went on to cross almost every tier of the market with a series of rollouts such as Project Poirot, Project Bell, Project Bernanke, Project Jedi Blue, Project Liberty, Project Wolf and Project Centillion. This Ad Tech OG’s AI-Powered Analytics Startup Just Raised $9M In Series A Funding Newton Research, a company led by ex-Data Plus Math exec John Hoctor has raised $9 million two years after it was founded, taking its total funding to $14 million. Contributors to the latest Series A round include Greycroft and Bessemer Partners, along with S4S Ventures, Aperiam Ventures, plus LiveRamp’s investment arm. Fortunes are fluctuating, despite earnings increases across the board… time for consolidation? The adoption of AI tools like agentic offerings and smarts in new hires to power more of media agency workings continues to pick up pace. The Amazon threat to The Trade Desk is inevitable — just not immediate.

Title: Trump says Nvidia's 15% duty applies to ‘old’ H20 chips, may permit export of up to 50% downgraded Blackwell chip
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/trump-says-nvidias-15-duty-applies-to-old-h20-chips-may-permit-export-of-up-to-50-downgraded-blackwell-chip-11754960987661.html

Full Content:
US President Donald Trump stated that the current duties over Nvidia's export deal with China only cover the older H20 chip, which he described as “essentially old." Speaking to the reporters on Monday (E.T.), Trump said he would consider a deal that would let Nvidia send its Blackwell chips to China if the company could make them less advanced. “It’s possible I’d make a deal” on a “somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell” processor, he said.. “In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.” Additionally, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to visit this week to discuss the new chip, Blackwell. Earlier, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) had agreed to give 15% of their Chinese AI chip sales revenues to the US government. This deal is meant to secure export licenses and is considered an unusual arrangement that could unsettle both US companies and Beijing, reported Bloomberg News. Trump mentioned he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut for the US if he approved H20 sales to China, but he ultimately agreed to a 15% share. The two negotiated “a little deal,” he said. Nvidia intends to allocate 15% of its revenue from H20 AI accelerator sales China, the report noted citing a person familiar with the matter, while AMD will pay the same share from MI308 revenues. The revenue-sharing agreement for Nvidia's H20 chip and the possibility of another one for Blackwell chip highlight Trump’s consistent effort to orchestrate a financial gain for America in exchange for trade concessions. Such unprecedented arrangements, however, risk setting a precedent for all American companies operating in the Asian nation and may undermine the US government’s justification for export controls, the report said, citing experts. Over the past week, Trump has criticised chipmakers with various statements that unsettled firms from Silicon Valley to Asia. On Wednesday, he threatened to impose 100% tariffs on imported chips unless companies invested more in the US. However, these new tariffs would likely affect very few companies, as most major chipmakers are already covered by existing investments or trade agreements.

Net AUM for the month of June 2025 was ₹ 74,40,670.84 crores. - The AAUM for the month of July 2025 is ₹ 77,00,420.46. crores Mutual Fund Folios are at 24,57,24,339 as of July 2025 - Retail MF Folios (Equity + Hybrid + Solution Oriented Schemes) are at 19,41,95,038 for the month of July 2025 as against 19,07,05,687 in June 2025 - Retail AUM (Equity + Hybrid + Solution Oriented Schemes) stood at ₹ 43,90,919 crores for July 2025 while the May 2025 AUM was ₹ 43,99,405 crores - 53rd month of positive equity inflows, starting from March 2021 - Growth/Equity Oriented schemes inflows for the month of July 2025 are ₹ 42,702.35 crores highest month on month equity inflow - Number of new SIPs registered in July 2025 stood at 68,69,061 - The SIP AUM is at ₹ 15,19,455.54 crores for the month of July 2025 - SIP contribution for July 2025 stood at ₹ 28,464.03 crores The number of Contributing SIP accounts stood at 9,11,18,391 crores in July 2025 - A total of 30 schemes were launched in the month of July 2025, all open-ended and across categories, raising a total of ₹ 30,416 crores Quote from Mr. Venkat N Chalasani, Chief Executive, AMFI - July 2025 Data Release: “The total Assets under Management grew by 1.3% to Rs 75.36 Lakh Crores, despite pressures from strong US Dollar and persistent foreign fund outflows. This is a testament to sustained investor confidence and disciplined participation. Equity mutual funds recorded their highest-ever monthly inflow of ₹42,702 crore, with DIIs maintaining strong support. SIP contributions hit a new record of ₹28,464 crore, and contributing accounts grew 5.4% to 9.11 crore - clear evidence of disciplined investing even amid volatility. AMFI remains committed to investor education and fostering a transparent, well-regulated ecosystem that supports long-term wealth creation.” Hindalco’s subsidiary Novelis reports a weak Q1FY26 with EBITDA/tonne at $432, below the expected $445–450, due to high scrap prices, a weaker product mix, and a $28 million tariff hit ($60 million expected in Q2). Management believes EBITDA has bottomed out, with tariff mitigation and a $100 million+ cost-cutting program set to improve 2HFY26 performance. Net debt rose 8% QoQ to $5.29 billion, a 19-quarter high, driven by Bay Minette plant investments, with leverage at 3.2x. Despite near-term pressures, strong beverage packaging demand and cost reductions support long-term growth, though rising debt and tariffs remain risks. Hindalco’s stock was stable at ₹672.85–676.

Title: Stripe Is Building A Blockchain: Can Openness Survive Branded Rails?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christiancatalini/2025/08/11/stripe-is-building-a-blockchain-can-openness-survive-branded-rails/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T00:20:00Z

ByChristian Catalini ByChristian Catalini, Contributor. Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called “Tempo,” per a now-removed job posting and Fortune’s reporting. This payments-optimized chain would fill a critical gap in Stripe’s crypto stack, complementing its recent acquisitions of stablecoin startup Bridge and wallet infrastructure provider Privy. Stablecoins promise to make crypto mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments. The paradox: the same move could undercut what the technology set out to achieve. Add the rush to branded rails—Robinhood’s chain on Arbitrum, Coinbase’s Base on the OP Stack, and now Stripe’s Tempo—and we could end up close to where we started, just with block explorers. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. With the GENIUS Act now law, the next 12–18 months will likely determine the outcome. We’ve seen this tension before in the early internet’s open web versus walled gardens. In the history of technology, the pendulum regularly swings between centralization and decentralization. Even when a technology has a decentralizing effect, economies of scale in a new dimension—whether complementary resources, talent, brand, or distribution—inevitably become vectors of concentration. Once concentration becomes too high, the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and developers invents a new approach to reverse it. A prominent example is the early internet, which brought a wave of entry and competition to the heavily concentrated industries of telecommunications, retail, and media—only to create the perfect conditions for today’s tech giants to scale through network effects and capture a sizable share of value. Although the underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants from competing services by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us. And while we are clearly better off—more choice, lower prices—it’s increasingly clear that some would prefer a world where platforms do not have as much power and influence over them. Crypto’s reason for existence was to break free from centralized intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. And while the original Bitcoin vision of a fully democratic network—“one‑CPU‑one‑vote”—didn’t pan out due to economies of scale in mining, Bitcoin did deliver what more and more financial institutions and some governments now recognize as a novel and neutral financial asset. Inspired by Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and developers have applied the same principles in an attempt to bring decentralization back to other digital platforms—starting with payments, but branching out into finance, marketplaces, messaging, and social media. Overall, progress toward decentralization is mixed: while it’s true that Bitcoin allows anyone around the world to be their own bank, the vast majority of consumers and institutions rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer consumers greater control over their private data and the content they create have stayed niche—often because they lag in usability and convenience relative to the centralized counterparts they’re trying to replace. Convenience eats privacy for lunch any day—and it’s difficult to undo the entrenched network effects of the leading digital platforms. In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed, and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access—and on what terms. Because of winner‑take‑all dynamics, markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in—the most salient example is China’s introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the payments oligopoly established by Ant Group and Tencent. Crypto is a natural, market‑driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as truly open and interoperable financial rails via their base layers. But as the technology has matured, two core problems have emerged. The first problem is that cryptocurrencies are volatile and therefore expensive for payments and financial contracts. To address this, the market has focused on fiat‑backed stablecoins; this inevitably leads to centralization because issuance and sound management require a regulated financial entity to be in charge of—and accountable for—reserve operations. While distributed governance of a stablecoin network is technically possible, it is extremely difficult to get the design right. Libra is the most prominent example: despite backing from more than two dozen leading global companies and countless resources dedicated to establishing credible distributed governance, the project was always perceived as Meta’s initiative. Banks have tried for more than a decade to come together as consortia in response to crypto, and, to date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. The reason is obvious: until the situation is truly dire, competitors are unlikely to commit to a joint solution—so, in the meantime, everyone hedges their bets across multiple tracks. Intuitively, distributed ownership of a stablecoin network makes sense and is not that different from what ultimately made Visa scale in the 1970s—when Bank of America relinquished control of the BankAmericard credit card program to respond to increasing competition from the consortium that would become Mastercard. Networks of crypto exchanges and fintechs, such as the Global Dollar Network, may be able to move faster, given the agility of the new entrants backing them, but they will still need to strike the right balance between economic incentives and governance to shift members from a wait‑and‑see mode—where everyone hopes to free‑ride on others’ efforts—into action. Even Circle’s Centre Consortium, which had only Circle and Coinbase as members, was dissolved and converted into a simple revenue‑sharing agreement. So, while there might be a solution to the decentralized governance of a stablecoin, what we know is that, to date, the only working model is one that places a single entity in charge of everything. This is, of course, problematic in the long term, and while issuers today control only the asset, they have already started expanding their offerings in ways that limit openness. For example, Circle announced its payment network (CPN), which places it at the center of how payments are executed—from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every API interaction and price and liquidity discovery, to, of course, collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from the model that has allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate payments for decades. The second problem crypto has run into is one that is deeply tied to its roots: decentralization is expensive. The economic consequence is that you can only afford it where it truly matters. To date, among networks at scale, that’s been true only for the base layers of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At most, that yields a few thousand decentralized transactions per second globally across all of them combined—a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you layer financial services on top. As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high‑throughput scaling solutions (L2s). L2s offer near‑zero fees and instant settlement, and they’re profitable because they internalize Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)—the gains from reordering, inserting, or omitting transactions in a block. While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns precisely with economic theory: users are willing to pay a premium for decentralization and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily trade some of that for greater centralization in higher layers to gain lower costs and faster speeds. The base layers remain open and trustless, and depending on the application, participants may compromise further—even embracing fully trusted, centralized solutions. This trade‑off is broader than a user’s decision to be their own bank and self‑custody funds versus accepting some degree of trust in a third‑party wallet. When building products, Coinbase, Robinhood, and the like care deeply that the underlying network stays neutral and does not play favorites among applications, developers, or businesses—the way the tech giants do on their platforms. Essentially, they are willing to pay for decentralization and neutrality to reduce the risk of hold‑up and expropriation—something that has repeatedly played out on traditional digital platforms. To fully grasp what fast, low‑cost L2s will do to payments and competition in crypto, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing—and now, with AI, also generating—large swaths of content fell to zero, business models had to evolve drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.) emerged to take advantage of the new economics at play. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience, and allow builders to deliver experiences much closer to traditional fintech products, they are the obvious layer where most of the value will be created—and appropriated. Furthermore, as basic money becomes free and commoditized, competition shifts to the value‑added services and workflows associated with it. That’s exactly where fintechs, neobanks, crypto exchanges, and even traditional financial institutions have a significant advantage. Any one of these players, if it executes well over the next couple of years, can use the technology to establish the first truly massive and global financial network. Once it reaches scale, it could also progressively degrade interoperability, appropriating more of the value—much as today’s internet giants did. So what’s the most likely scenario? Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been in crypto over the last decade, it’s safe to assume that payments and financial services will disproportionately gravitate toward a couple of leading blockchains. The remaining chains will need to specialize within an industry vertical to stay relevant. Most activity will take place not on their decentralized base layers but on scaling layers branded and shaped by crypto and fintech players (e.g., Base, Robinhood Chain), applications (e.g., Unichain, World Chain), and financial institutions (e.g., Kinexys, Fnality, Partior). Players that control distribution—whether on the consumer, merchant, or institutional side—have a massive advantage, as they own the interface between the blockchain and the real world. Blockchains drastically lower the cost of verifying and coordinating onchain data, but their value is limited without a strong nexus with complementary offchain information—identity, compliance, credentials, creditworthiness, and more. That’s where friction persists—and where economies of scale will decide winners and losers. This is why stablecoin issuers have strong incentives either to commoditize the rails—by issuing on multiple networks and positioning themselves at the center of interoperability across them (e.g., Circle’s Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol)—or to nudge most activity to a network they control, such as a new L2 or a higher‑level protocol like CPN. Either strategy gives them a shot at becoming massive global fintech leaders and capturing most of the value the technology creates. Meanwhile, crypto and fintech players will want to shift those same valuable transactions to a network over which they have more sway, such as a branded L2. In doing so, they’ll also want either to commoditize stablecoins and other tokenized assets, or to issue their own. In the latter scenario, stablecoins may well be used as a loss leader to expand the reach of a fintech’s offering, and domestic stablecoins will be issued to gain more control over the FX market and support local use cases. Real‑world assets (RWAs), memecoins, other tokens, and applications that are truly differentiated and exclusive to those networks may also help these branded chains retain volume within their borders. The same companies will be able to develop clever rewards and loyalty programs that increase consumer and business stickiness within their ecosystems. As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different than it is today. The good news is that, as part of that transformation, it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralization, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source and forkable means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure to retain greater interoperability than under the status quo. It is also possible that because crypto protocols allow for new market design and incentives, the ultimate solution will be something that was not quite achievable for the internet protocols—which did not have built‑in monetization mechanisms. Regardless, once centralization materializes, some clever group of developers will work hard to undo it, and the cycle will repeat.

Search The Points Guy As soon as people find out that I work for The Points Guy, they almost always follow up with one question: "What's the best credit card?" My answer is usually, "It depends" — because there truly is no one-size-fits-all credit card that's best for everyone. Several factors go into determining the best credit card for your situation, including your spending habits, your credit score and the type of rewards you want to earn. Some regular contenders frequently make the cut when I recommend new credit cards since they offer solid value for a variety of spenders and their lifestyles. I've had my fair share of them over my 20-plus years of collecting points and miles. Here are my top picks for the best credit cards you can add to your wallet. *TPG founder Brian Kelly is a Bilt adviser and investor. **The information for the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer. Check out how my top recommendations for the best credit cards stack up against each other. †You must use the card five times each statement period to earn points on rent and qualifying net purchases. Standout benefits: The Chase Sapphire Preferred was one of the first cards I opened that carried an annual fee. Initially, I got the card because it didn't charge foreign transaction fees, but I quickly fell in love with the rewards I was earning — both abroad and back in the U.S. By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time. Chase Ultimate Rewards points are among the most valuable currencies out there, pegged at 2.05 cents each per TPG's August 2025 valuations. As a Sapphire Preferred cardholder, you can redeem your points through Chase Travel at a rate of 1.25 cents apiece, but my favorite way to use Chase points is by transferring them to travel partners like Air Canada Aeroplan and World of Hyatt. Hyatt is my go-to redemption option here, as I almost always get well over 2 cents per point in value from my award stays. For example, I splurged for four nights at the Hyatt Centric Park City earlier this year, and even though it set me back 180,000 points, the paid rate would've been nearly $6,000. I was even able to apply a suite upgrade as a Hyatt Globalist. Related: Why the Chase Sapphire Preferred should be your first card out of college Beyond that, the card offers an incredible set of travel protections if things go wrong on your trip, including primary car rental coverage. You'll also enjoy a $50 annual hotel credit for reservations made through Chase Travel. I eventually upgraded to the card's more premium sibling — the Chase Sapphire Reserve® (see rates and fees) — a few years ago, but my wife continues to hold her Sapphire Preferred and still gets incredible value from it. New applicants can earn 75,000 points after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. The Sapphire Preferred features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Apply here: Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Standout benefits: I picked up the Capital One Venture X shortly after it launched in November 2021, and it quickly became a workhorse in my wallet because it earns at least 2 miles per dollar spent on every purchase. I charge my utility bills and most of my online shopping to it, since those purchases generally aren't eligible for bonuses on other cards. The card also offers a ton of premium perks without a premium price tag. You'll enjoy access to Capital One Lounges and a Priority Pass Select membership, along with the ability to enjoy value-added benefits on luxury hotel stays via the Premier Collection and Lifestyle Collection. All of this comes with an annual fee of just $395. However, even that is super easy to offset with other perks on the card. You'll get an annual $300 credit for purchases via Capital One Travel — including flights, hotels and rental cars. You can also use the card for up to $120 in statement credits to cover the cost of a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership every four years. Related: Capital One Venture Rewards vs. Capital One Venture X Finally, when you renew your card, you'll receive 10,000 bonus miles on your account anniversary. Those are worth at least $100 if used for travel, but they have the potential for even more value when you redeem them with Capital One's 15-plus transfer partners. I recently transferred 70,000 Capital One miles to Air Canada Aeroplan to book a one-way business-class flight to Europe for Thanksgiving — a trip that would've otherwise set me back over $3,000. And that's just one method of maximizing your Capital One miles. New applicants can earn 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $395 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Capital One Venture X. Learn more: Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card Standout benefits: Believe it or not, I first added the Amex Gold to my wallet without earning a welcome bonus. I held an earlier version of the card, so I wasn't eligible. However, I still earn tens of thousands of points on the card every year — and last year's refresh made me love it even more. I love dining out and cooking in, and the Amex Gold rewards you in both categories. You'll earn 4 points per dollar spent at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases each year, then 1 point per dollar) and 4 points per dollar spent at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases each year, then 1 point per dollar). Membership Rewards points are super valuable — with partners like ANA Mileage Club and Air France-KLM Flying Blue. Related: How to maximize the Amex Gold's benefits However, the card can also save you money on everyday purchases as well, thanks to the following benefits (enrollment required): ***Uber Cash is valid on purchases in the U.S. and you must first add your Amex Gold to your Uber account. You can then redeem with any Amex card. In fact, I was getting so much value out of this card that my wife was convinced to get her own Amex Gold card last year — essentially doubling the value we can get from these statement credits every year. With the Amex Gold, you can find out your offer and see if you are eligible for as high as 100,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $6,000 on purchases within the first six months of card membership. Welcome offers vary, and you may not be eligible for an offer. This card's annual fee is $325. For more information, check out our review of the Amex Gold Card. Apply here: American Express Gold Card Standout benefits: Before I got the Capital One Venture X, I had the regular Venture Card — which is a great alternative for those who aren't willing to pay for a premium rewards card. You'll enjoy the same base earning rate of 2 miles per dollar spent on all purchases, and you'll enjoy access to Capital One's Lifestyle Collection of hotels around the world. The card also includes up to $120 in statement credits for a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership every four years — a rarity for a card with just a $95 annual fee. In addition, the Venture Card can be the perfect option for those just getting started who value simplicity but may want the option of maximizing rewards in the future. Capital One miles can be used to offset any travel purchase charged to the card at a value of 1 cent per point. However, you also have the ability to leverage Capital One's transfer partners for even more value. This gives you a great starting point — with the chance to unlock more rewards down the road. New applicants can earn 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Capital One Venture Rewards. Learn more: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card Standout benefits: I've held the Amex Platinum for years, and it's among the priciest travel cards out there, with a massive $695 annual fee. However, each time my card comes up for renewal, I crunch the numbers and realize that I easily get that much in value every year — and then some. For example, when you add the Amex Platinum to your Uber account, you'll receive $15 a month in Uber Cash plus a one-time bonus of $20 in the month of December (valid for rides and Uber Eats orders in the U.S.; can pay using any Amex card). I also enjoy the up to $20 a month in statement credits I receive for select digital entertainment providers, which I use to offset the cost of my daughter's Disney+ obsession (enrollment is required). Then there's the up to $200 airline fee statement credit each calendar year — which I mainly use for Sky Club guest access for my daughter. These three perks alone can offer me up to $640 in annual benefits, nearly covering the card's entire annual fee. Enrollment is required. Related: Maximizing the Amex Platinum's benefits Beyond these statement credits, the Amex Platinum offers unparalleled airport lounge access, including Centurion Lounges, Priority Pass lounges (enrollment is required) and Plaza Premium locations. You can also access Delta Sky Clubs when flying Delta Air Lines, though you are capped at 10 visits per year unless you spent $75,000 in the current (or previous) calendar year. There's nothing I love more than relaxing in a quiet space prior to a flight — and the Platinum Card delivers just that. With the Amex Platinum, you can find out your offer and see if you are eligible for as 175,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $8,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership. Welcome offers vary, and you may not be eligible for an offer. This card's annual fee is $695. For more information, check out our review of the Amex Platinum Card. Apply here: Amex Platinum Standout benefits: I've been a longtime Delta flyer. In fact, I was a charter Diamond Medallion member when that elite status first launched in 2010 — qualifying entirely on domestic segments, no less. And even though I'm no longer a road warrior, I still love flying Delta. And the Delta Reserve Card helps make those trips even more rewarding. Even though it carries a hefty annual fee, the perks are extensive. You'll receive 2,500 Medallion Qualification Dollars (MQDs) each year just for having the card, putting you halfway to Silver Medallion status. You can then earn 1 MQD for every $10 spent on the card, allowing you to spend your way to status. The card also includes 15 visits to Sky Clubs every year plus four, one-time-use guest passes — though you can unlock unlimited visits as the primary cardmember when you spend $75,000 on purchases in a calendar year. But my favorite perk is the annual companion certificate you receive upon renewal. This allows you to bring a travel companion on select Delta-operated flights just by paying the taxes and fees. It's even valid on select Comfort+ and first-class tickets. Last year, I used this for a flight to Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) for me and my daughter to go skiing, a ticket that would've otherwise been over $900. New applicants can earn 70,000 miles after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first six months of card membership. This card's annual fee is $650. For more information, check out our review of the Delta SkyMiles Reserve. Apply here: Delta SkyMiles Reserve Amex Standout benefits: You may be surprised to see a cash-back credit card on this list, but the Freedom Flex is so much more — let's start with the earning rates. Cardholders earn 5% cash back on the first $1,500 in combined purchases you spend each quarter in rotating bonus categories (after activation). With a wife and 10-year-old daughter, I spend a ton at Amazon, so that's a great return on purchases I'm already making. However, I'm not just earning cash back. Instead, since I also have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, I have the ability to combine these rewards in my Sapphire account — which effectively converts them to fully transferable Ultimate Rewards points. In other words, this card allows me to earn 5 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on these rotating categories. Related: 4 reasons I recommend the Chase Freedom Flex to beginners In fact, I max out the quarterly bonus so frequently that I have both this card and the old Chase Freedom card (no longer available to new applicants) — which means I have double the earning potential each month. With this no-annual-fee card, new applicants can earn $200 after spending $500 on eligible purchases within the first three months of account opening. For more information, check out our review of the Chase Freedom Flex. Apply here: Chase Freedom Flex Standout benefits: The Ink Business Preferred can be a great fit for virtually any small business — but especially those with a big online presence. That's because of the bonus categories on the card. Each year, you'll earn 3 points per dollar on up to $150,000 in combined spending across the following categories: If you fully max out that bonus, you'll take home 450,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points — which can then be used for cash back, gift cards or trips through Chase's lucrative transfer partners. It also has no foreign transaction fees when you're outside the country, and with extensive travel and purchase protections for business trips, it can give you valuable peace of mind when on the road. New applicants can earn 90,000 points after spending $8,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Ink Business Preferred. Apply here: Ink Business Preferred Standout benefits: The Bilt Mastercard is the one card on this list that I've never had. However, that's solely due to the fact that I own my home. If you're a renter, and you're not currently earning points on your monthly rent, this card should absolutely be in your wallet. That's because you can earn 1 point per dollar spent on rent (up to 100,000 points each calendar year) without paying any transaction fees (see rates and fees), as long as you charge at least five purchases to the card each month. This holds true even if your landlord or apartment management company isn't part of the Bilt Rewards program and doesn't accept credit cards. You can log in to the Bilt Rewards app and use your Bilt Mastercard to send a monthly rent check or direct deposit, earning points in the process. Related: Guide to the Bilt Rewards program In addition to rent, you also earn 5 points per dollar spent on Lyft (after you link your Bilt and Lyft accounts), 3 points per dollar spent on dining, 2 points per dollar spent on travel and 1 point per dollar spent on all other purchases. And Bilt Rewards Points are incredibly valuable, with a wildly lucrative list of transfer partners — including World of Hyatt and Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan. Plus, Bilt runs Rent Day promotions that allow you to earn even more points on your everyday purchases — and potentially get even more value from your redemptions. The Bilt card does not come with a welcome offer and does not charge an annual fee (see rates and fees). For more information, check out our review of the Bilt Mastercard. Apply here: Bilt Mastercard Standout benefits: It's true that I have a lot of premium credit cards, but if you're looking to up your hotel game, the Hilton Aspire Card can be a great option. Beyond the hefty welcome bonus, it also unlocks a ton of perks — both when staying at Hilton properties and across other spending activities. For starters, you'll enjoy automatic top-tier Hilton Honors Diamond status, just by holding the card. This grants you complimentary upgrades as well as a daily food-and-beverage credit at eligible properties in the U.S. (or complimentary breakfast at international locations). This status normally requires 60 nights to achieve, so this is a remarkable shortcut. Related: 7 reasons to get the Hilton Amex Aspire card In addition, you get a free night certificate when you open the card and then every year after renewal, and this can be used at virtually any Hilton property worldwide (with just a few exceptions). In addition, you'll enjoy up to $400 in annual statement credits at Hilton resort properties — up to $200 from January to June and up to $200 from July to December. Last year, I used the certificate to book the Conrad Fort Lauderdale Beach when the room rates were over $800 per night — and I used the $200 credit for the second half of the year to cover most of a spa treatment for my wife (it was her birthday). Talk about rewarding! Finally, I love the up to $200 in statement credits for airline purchases each year, broken up as $50 each quarter. I've used this for taxes and fees on award tickets as well as inflight food and beverage purchases. New applicants can earn 175,000 points after spending $6,000 on purchases in your first six months of card membership. This card features an annual fee of $550. For more information, check out our review of the Hilton Aspire Card. There's no denying that there are a lot of credit card options from which to choose. However, there are a few important things to consider when trying to pick the one that's best for you. However, one of the great things about having so many cards at your disposal is that you're not locked into a long-term commitment. If you want to try a new card, you can earn the welcome bonus and utilize the perks for the first year. Then, if it's not worth keeping, you can cancel it. (Just don't do it before the first year is up.) First, it's critical to think about your preferred rewards currency. Do you want cash back or travel points? Are you interested in rewards in a specific airline or hotel loyalty program? Part of this may be geographical. After all, earning American miles if you're based in Atlanta may not be worthwhile, given Delta's hub. However, if you live in Charlotte or Philadelphia, American may be a much better option. Alternatively, consider earning transferable rewards on cards like the Sapphire Preferred, Amex Gold or Capital One Venture. These points or miles convert to a number of airline and hotel partners, allowing you to book premium flights or luxury hotels by leveraging program sweet spots. Most cards offer welcome bonuses to new applicants, and these are a great way to quickly boost your account balance. Cards sometimes offer limited-time, elevated offers, so if you time it right, you could take home a ton of points or miles that can go a long way toward your next trip. Before you commit to a new card, take stock of your everyday spending habits. Most cards offer extra rewards in select categories of purchases, so you should pick one that matches where you spend your money. Are you a prolific chef at home? Go for a card with a category bonus at grocery stores. Love dining out? Get one with a bonus at restaurants. Or, if your spending is all over the place, get a card that offers a solid earning rate on all purchases. Finally, consider whether the cost of the card is worth it. The most rewarding cards out there typically impose an annual fee, and while this confers many perks, not all of them may be useful to you. While the welcome bonus typically offers enough value in year one, it's a harder decision after that. Crunch the actual, real-world value you can get from the card to make sure you get at least enough to cover the annual fee. Related: The 7 best credit cards with annual fees under $100 We chose the best credit cards based on a range of factors, including earning rates, welcome offers, benefits and perks. To read more about how TPG evaluates and chooses cards to spotlight in our roundups, check out our methodology. It's no coincidence that the vast majority of the cards on this list earn transferable rewards (the only exceptions are the Delta SkyMiles Reserve and the Chase Freedom Flex, though the latter becomes transferable in my wallet when paired with the Sapphire Reserve). That's because this type of rewards offers immense flexibility to book incredibly valuable trips. For example, let's say you want to book a flight to London by leveraging your Amex Platinum. Your first option is through American Express Travel, which offers a value of 1 cent per point. Alternatively, you can transfer Amex points to Delta, though SkyMiles award rates tend to be sky high. However, there's another option: Transfer your Amex points to Virgin Atlantic Flying Club, which can offer incredibly low rates to Europe — including economy and business class. Whenever someone asks me to name the best credit card, I always say that it depends. There are so many cards that could work for the average traveler, so it's critical to take some time to analyze what you want out of a card and where you spend your money. And if you're still overwhelmed, you really can't go wrong with any of the cards on this list — especially if you want to dip your toes into maximizing your rewards for your next trip.

Title: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Reminds Investors in IRobot (IRBT) of the Class Action Lawsuit and Encourages Investors to Inquire About Their Rights

August 11, 2025 19:37 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Diamond Comics Was Losing $1.3 Million Dollars A Week This April Alone

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, diamond Diamond Comic Distributors was burning through 1.3 million dollars a week back in April this year A transcript from the Diamond Comic Distributors chapter 11 bankruptcy court session held on the 30th of April has been unsealed. Checking the Bleeding Cool Diamond Bankruptcy Timeline, we discover that this is the day that the courts approved of the sale of Diamond Comic Distributors to the joint back-up bid of Universal and Ad Populum. But it was also the day after the bankruptcy auction winners Alliance Entertainment or AENT sued Diamond Comic Distributors Inc, the debtors in this case, for fraud, alleging the debtors withheld information about their Wizards of the Coast contract. WOTC withdrew from supplying Diamond after the auction, a contract worth tens of millions of dollars a year, and it was AENT's contention that Diamond knew this was coming and withheld the information from AENT, as it would have affected the bid price, something they estimated at around $13 million. Without Diamond agreeing to such a price reduction, AENT pulled out of their $85 million bid for Diamond. As a result, the backup – and originally preferred – bidders of Universal and Ad Populum were chosen, albeit for only $72.3 million, a $7.6 million cut for Universal and $5.5 million for Ad Populum on their auction bids, after renegotiation. Chief Judge David Rice presided over the proceedings. Attorney Mark Minuti of Saul Ewing, representing Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc., the debtors in the chapter 11 bankruptcy case, opened by providing context on the case's rapid deterioration. "A lot has been happening in the case, Your Honor, and unfortunately, most of what's happening has not been good." Detailing the supplier fallout, Robert Gorin, co-Chief Revenue Officer at Diamond, took to the witness stand, and was asked by the Judge if they considered opening the sale to the wider market again, as they did in the original auction. He replied, "Time is not our friend here. We are burning cash… about 1.2, 1.3 million a week." Now this was back in April, of course. But there is nothing to suggest this has gone down. In the Diamond financial filings for May 2025, the most recent such document that has been filed, if we exclude the comics and games business asset sales entries, the remaining loss appears to be approximately a $12 million loss for that month. Of this, the loss on sales alone, not counting payroll, rent, and other operating expenses, was reported as a $7.5 million loss. Diamond's professional fees and expenses, to Raymond James Financial, Getzler Henrich & Associates, and lead counsel Saul Ewing, LLP, were reported to be $1,182,225 for that month. Gorin told us "On April 17th we got an unexpected email from a vendor, an important vendor that said they were not going to renew their contract with the company." This is Wizards Of The Coasts of course, efforts to reverse this included a video conference, but "ultimately they came back the next day in writing and said they were not going to change their mind." Jason Teele of Sills Cummis & Gross, representing AENT, objected to the expedited hearing, citing less than twelve hours' notice and questioning a price reduction coincidence, saying "the purchase price under the new Sale Agreement has been reduced by an aggregate of approximately 13 or so million dollars, which is almost precisely the same amount that Raymond James, the Debtors investment bankers suggested to Alliance's investment bankers would be an appropriate reduction in the purchase price given the loss of the Debtor's largest vendor contract had the Debtors negotiated that issue with Alliance in good faith, which, of course, they did not. So it's very curious that a reduction in price of the same magnitude that was called for upon discovery of this material adverse change is exactly the reduction in purchase price offered to the backup bidder." He also wasn't happy that paperwork was being redacted. "It's concerning to Alliance, and I suggest it should be concerning to the Court, that the provision of the Universal Asset Purchase Agreement discussing material adverse changes and what can and can't be done in the event of a material adverse change is redacted… what do those redactions or unredacted version of that paragraph actually disclose? We don't know. I have theories, but those are just theories and speculation." As for those theories suggested by Teele, we can read between the lines. "There was no accounting for the fraud that we encountered as part of the closing process. That is the subject — one of the subjects of the Adversary Proceeding that I expect will be fully heard by the Court in due course. But I just want to point out that but for the discovery of that information, which had been concealed from at least Alliance, perhaps other bidders as well, we would have closed last Friday." It is worth knowing that Diamond owes AENT a significant sum as well, from the auction process. Teele added, "But I suggest that Alliance does have standing, not only as a prepetition Creditor holding a small dollar claim, but also as a postpetition Creditor to the extent of the $8.5 million deposit, which the Debtors have unreasonably refused to refund" Judge Rice asked Robert Gorin if Diamond had "ever given any thought to simply shutting down the business and liquidating the inventory or the other assets that were there?" Gorin replied, "We did, and we also had these conversations with the consultation parties as well, and our liquidation analysis shows it's significantly lower recovery to liquidate than to sell." And on why an extension in the DIP funding from JPMorgan Chase was necessary, "we need to keep running the company in the ordinary course, we need to be able to make payroll, we need to be able to pay our vendors and keep the airplane flying. As I keep telling everybody, we're trying to hold the airplane together while we're flying, and that is what we're trying to do. And we need the lender's help to do that." The DIP was extended but those vendors didn't seem to get paid. At least not yet. Gianfranco Finizio of Lowenstein Sandler, representing the Unsecured Creditors' Committee, supported the sales despite frustrations, saying, "We now find ourselves pivoting to the backup bidders. They've been, unfortunately, opportunistic. You've heard Mr. Minuti describe the value degradation in the bids. But we don't have a backup to the backup bidder. We don't have the luxury of time to go out and market these assets. The Committee thinks that we need to stop the bleed immediately, whether that's the bleed of finding a new buyer, the $1.2 million burn that Mr. Minuti referenced… These sales in this case should not be run for the sole benefit of JPM. You know, two weeks ago, we were in a very different scenario where we were in the money, and there was excess proceeds. But now, a lot has changed, and this sale cannot be just for the sole benefit of paying JPMorgan down and leaving administrative Creditors exposed" and adding "it's as clear as mud to us on what the post-sale Estate looks like". That would be JPMorgan Chase, the banks, represented by Jonathan Young of Troutman Pepper Locke who echoed support for the sale but noted the burn rate's impact: "The longer it takes to get to a monetization event, the greater the burn, the more my client has to consider lending, and the less distributable value for everyone." The US Trustee Gerard Vetter observed without opposition, citing "concerning allegations" but deferring on the sale. Judge Rice approved the motions, finding them a "sound exercise of the business judgment by the Debtors." He noted the "unusual course of events" but emphasised urgency: "That it's been a little bit difficult… is the reason why approving these matters today… is really necessary to protect the value of this Estate." It has been 31 weeks since Diamond entered Chapter 11. I refer the honourable members to the case of Jarndyce vs Jarndyce in Bleak House by Charles Dickens… You can use these Diamond tabs to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool.

The longstanding belief that a computer science degree from a top US university guarantees a high-paying job is increasingly being challenged. Despite booming enrollments, many graduates struggle to find work due to AI-driven automation, tech industry layoffs, and shifting employer priorities. Entry-level coding jobs are disappearing, while AI tools now dominate both programming and the hiring process. Experts emphasize that success no longer depends solely on degree or basic coding skills but requires deep expertise, problem-solving ability, and specialized knowledge in AI, system design, or physical sciences. Students are urged to adapt through learning, niche specialization, and alternative careers.

Title: On theCUBE Pod: OpenAI’s ecosystem play, Nvidia’s open-source question and the race for AI dominance
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/08/11/openai-ecosystem-play-nvidias-open-source-ai-dominance-thecubepod/

UPDATED 14:01 EDT / AUGUST 11 2025 by Chad Wilson The OpenAI ecosystem is undergoing a rapid transformation, redefining how frontier artificial intelligence models are deployed, monetized and integrated into enterprise workflows. With moves that widen its partnerships beyond long-standing alliances, OpenAI Inc. is positioning itself for a new era of scale, developer adoption and competitive resilience. In this week’s episode of theCUBE Pod, John Furrier (pictured, left), executive analyst at theCUBE Research, and Dave Vellante (right), chief analyst at theCUBE Research, talk about how industry watchers are tracking a confluence of strategic shifts: horizontal expansion into multiple cloud environments, fresh licensing approaches through open weights and the unveiling of GPT-5 with improved coding capabilities. These developments OpenAI ecosystem come amid rising speculation about an IPO and a potential recalibration of the company’s relationship with Microsoft Corp. “This is a huge deal because it’s the open-source license. There’s a story hiding in plain sight that no one’s talking about,” Furrier said. “I think the signaling that I’m reading between the tea leaves is OpenAI is losing the relationship; there’s a breakup coming with Microsoft’s. Clearly decoupling going on.” OpenAI’s decision to launch on Amazon Web Services Inc., with models running from day one, marks a notable broadening of its cloud presence. This strategic alignment not only grants AWS a new AI asset in its portfolio but also gives OpenAI access to thousands of enterprise customers beyond Microsoft Azure. The company’s simultaneous move to make open-weight models available could further entice developers seeking to customize AI for their specific verticals, opening up the OpenAI ecosystem even more according to Vellante. “I was on the Nvidia analyst call. The big question is what’s OpenAI’s commitment to open source,” he said. “It’s not only open source, it’s open weights. To me, that’s the more interesting piece of this because if it’s open weights, then enterprises can customize it for their own needs, but it’s a GPT-3 class model. It’s now two generations behind the state-of-the-art because today GPT-5 came out.” The launch of GPT-5 underscores how quickly the competitive landscape is evolving. OpenAI’s latest model delivers notable improvements in reasoning, accuracy and code generation — areas critical to AI’s next adoption wave. Paired with a multicloud strategy, these product advances hint at an intentional decoupling from Microsoft in favor of a more balanced partner portfolio, Furrier explained. “OpenAI clearly is playing an ecosystem play,” he said. “If you look at the narratives … it is absolutely a go-to-market ecosystem move by OpenAI. they are clearly going horizontal in the execution. That is a direct counter to a relationship with Microsoft that is a decoupling hedge or intentional plan to expand the base.” Beyond the OpenAI ecosystem narrative, the discussion also touched on other significant developments shaping tech and business strategy. From policy-driven shifts in crypto markets to legacy chipmakers facing innovation pressure, theCUBE’s coverage continues to link macro trends with on-the-ground insight from key venues. At events such as Black Hat, AI security implications remain top of mind. Meanwhile, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, conversations in the “NYSE Wired: Crypto Trailblazers” series are bringing together founders, investors and policymakers to discuss the future of digital assets — especially as the GENIUS Act introduces clearer regulations for stablecoins and institutional adoption accelerates, according to Furrier. “This is going to bring in Fidelity, it’s going to bring in all the top people,” he said. “You can now back stable coins with payments. All the deposit institutions, federal agencies, the regulatory antiquated system has been the bottleneck in crypto. GENIUS Act is one, the AI stuff that they’re doing, these are policy things that they’re grinding out and people don’t appreciate this.” Chip industry challenges were also spotlighted through analysis of Intel’s recent struggles and strategic opportunities. Calls from former Intel board members for structural and IP-related changes reflect a broader urgency for U.S. semiconductor competitiveness, particularly against ARM-based architectures and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd’s cost advantages, Vellante detailed. “The problem with their scenario … is Operation Warp Speed might work for vaccines, but it doesn’t work for silicon,” Vellante said. “The second, as I said, the cap table is too complicated. The third is it completely leaves TSM out of the picture. You take their cash and you take their commitment and you give them guaranteed supply over time. And the cap table is the U.S. government, U.S. taxpayers, TSM, maybe throw Intel a little bone and then the private equity.” Anshul Sadana, founder and CEO of Nexthop AI Andy Jassy, president and CEO of Amazon Matt Garman, CEO at AWS Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla George Gilbert, principal analyst at theCUBE Research Mike Speiser, managing director at Sutter Hill Ventures Reid Hoffman, partner at Greylock Partners Charlene Barshefsky, lawyer and former United States Trade Representative Scott Ferrall, American radio personality and host Jim Plummer, electrical engineer from Stanford University David B.

Title: 120 Million Square Feet: Store Closings In The United States Are On Pace To Set A New Record High In 2025

Editor Economy Michael Snyder, The Economic Collapse Blog If everything is going to be just fine, why are thousands of stores closing all over the country? So far this year, the total amount of retail space that has been permanently closed has surpassed 120 million square feet. We have never seen anything like this before. Store closings spiked during the early days of the pandemic, but in 2025 stores are being permanently shuttered at an even faster pace. In fact, during the first six months of this year 5,822 store closures were recorded… Store closures across the U.S. continue to rise, and remain on track to far significantly surpass both new openings and the figures seen in 2024. According to a new report from research and advisory firm Coresight Research, cited by CoStar News, 5,822 store closures were recorded as of June 27, compared to 3,496 closures announced during the same period of 2024. If stores continue to close at this rate, we will break the old record that was established during the pandemic by a wide margin. We are also being told that the total amount of retail space that has been permanently shuttered in 2025 has reached a staggering 120 million square feet… In June, store closings by Plano, Texas-based home goods seller At Home and Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain Rite Aid, which have both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, “pushed the total amount of retail space to close in the U.S. this year to over 120 million square feet,” Coresight said. The real estate churn is happening “as cyclical impacts confront structural shifts,” according to one executive at the research firm. Wow. You may have noticed that there are an increasing number of abandoned buildings in your particular area. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Consumers are under more financial stress than we have ever seen, and that has resulted in a substantial decline in store traffic… Many of the retail store closures are a result of declining store traffic as more consumers respond to inflation by reducing spending. There also are more consumers turning to online shopping especially for apparel, accessories and household items. The winner is not merely Amazon but increased competition from Temu and Shein marketplaces and social commerce outlets like TikTok. Needless to say, more stores are being closed down with each passing day. After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Claire’s announced that it will be closing 18 more stores… Claire’s, a mall-based teen accessories retailer, has identified several locations across the country it plans to close after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Claire’s U.S., which operates Claire’s and Icing stores, made the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Wednesday. It’s the second time since 2018 the company has filed for bankruptcy. While the company says the majority of its retail stores will remain open while it “continues to explore all strategic alternatives,” Claire’s said it identified 18 stores ahead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing it would close, filings show. And home goods retailer At Home just announced that it will be closing 6 more stores… The home goods retailer At Home is closing an additional six stores across the country, bringing its total closure tally to more than two dozen as it grapples with high debt and dwindling sales. The furniture and home decor retailer based in Coppell, Texas, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 16, pointing to “broader economic and retail-specific market pressures,” in court documents. The bankruptcy filing and store closures follow several other “big box” retailers that have also significantly downsized their brick-and-mortar footprints this year, including Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, and Party City. The retailer intially announced 26 store closures in June, before paring that down to 24 when it decided to keep open two stores in New Jersey and Wisconsin. The company added another six stores to the list, according to a statement by retail firm Hilco Consumer-Retail on Aug. 1, bringing the current number of stores it will shutter in the coming months to 30. We see more stories like this every single day. So what is going to happen if our economic momentum continues to take us very rapidly in the wrong direction? Earlier today, we learned that the percentage of student loans entering serious delinquency is absolutely exploding… The total amount of outstanding student loan debt was $1.64 trillion in the second quarter of 2025 after rising by $7 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the share of student loan debt entering serious delinquency, considered 90 days or more late, jumped to 12.9% at the end of June, up from 8% in March and above pre-pandemic trends that were around 9-10% from 2012 into early 2020, when the moratorium initially took effect. The American people are drowning in debt, and I expect delinquency rates of all types to continue to rise in the months ahead. We are going to see more layoffs too, and the fact that continuing claims for unemployment benefits just hit their highest level since 2021 is not a good sign at all… Recurring applications for unemployment benefits surged to the highest since November 2021, adding to recent signs that the labor market is weakening. Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose by 38,000 to 1.97 million in the week ended July 26, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. On top of everything else, U.S. manufacturing activity is now in contraction territory… From March to July, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly survey. The Manufacturing PMI last registered at 48, below the 50 score that differentiates growth and decline. The effective average tariff rate on all imported goods now stands at around roughly 18% versus 2.3% last year, the highest levels since the 1930s. We are in so much trouble. After evaluating all of the latest economic numbers that have come in, Mark Zandi has come to the conclusion that the “economy is on the precipice of recession”… Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, on Monday wrote a post on X that the “economy is on the precipice of recession” – citing the weaker-than-expected jobs report released Friday and the inflation data from the previous day that showed consumer prices rose as indicating the economy’s precarious position. “Consumer spending has flatlined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall. And with inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue,” he wrote. It is hard to argue with him. Of course what is eventually coming is going to be so much worse than just a “recession”. As conditions deteriorate, will store closings slow down or will they speed up? The answer to that question is obvious. If there are stores in your local area that you really enjoy, I would visit them now while you still can, because they might not be there next year.

Title: The new American workplace crisis: Return-to-office mandates lead to a working mom exodus

She was previously an editorial leader at Bankrate, The Points Guy, and Business Insider, and a reporter at Bloomberg News. Ashley is a graduate of Ohio University's Scripps School of Journalism. The historic surge in employment among working mothers seen during the pandemic has reversed sharply in 2025, as new data reveal tens of thousands of American women, especially those with young children, leaving the workforce. According to federal labor statistics analyzed by the Washington Post, the labor force participation rate for women ages 25 to 44 with children under 5 fell nearly three percentage points between January and June 2025, reaching its lowest level in over three years. Fortune’s analysis integrates these workforce shifts with a broader view of corporate America’s changing priorities. Our coverage finds: This pullback follows the widespread rollback of remote and flexible work policies that initially ushered many mothers back to the job market. Major corporations and the federal government have now instituted strict return-to-office mandates, requiring five-days-a-week in-person attendance. For many mothers, the loss of flexibility means a logistical and financial reckoning. JPMorgan Chase, AT&T, and Amazon, among others, ramped up their in-office requirements in 2025, with Fortune reporting that the share of Fortune 500 companies with full-time mandates nearly doubled since late 2024. Employers report difficulty replacing departed female talent, with overall productivity suffering as a result. Compounding these changes are rising childcare costs, closures of childcare centers due to lapsing federal aid, and a noticeable trend toward traditional gender roles. Social media movements like #tradwife encourage women to prioritize home and children, amplified by calls from political leaders for more parents to stay home. For many families facing unaffordable childcare, the decision is an economic necessity rather than a cultural choice. Black women and those with college degrees have been hit especially hard. The unemployment rate for Black women climbed to its highest in nearly four years; federal layoffs and the dismantling of diversity initiatives eliminated stable jobs that disproportionately supported minority women. Experts interviewed by both the Washington Post and Fortune warn that these trends, if left unchecked, will have “huge implications” for women’s lifetime earnings, career prospects, and retirement security. With breaks in employment history, women frequently return to lower-paying jobs and face diminished opportunities for advancement. Studies, including a 2024 University of Pittsburgh analysis, similarly show that aggressive return-to-office mandates have led to a loss of senior employees—many of them women—threatening productivity and competitiveness.

Microsoft reportedly preparing to boost in-office working When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft could be the latest tech giant to explore a stricter in-office working policy, with reports claiming the company is reportedly considering enacting a three-day office-working policy for most employees. Until now, workers have been able to spend around half of their time at home (or away from the office) despite rivals like Amazon enforcing stricter full-time office-working policies. A Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider the company had been exploring changes to the policy, but no official alterations have been made yet. The report claims an official Microsoft announcement could come as soon as September 2025, with rollout of any changes arriving as soon as January 2026, although dates and indeed policies may vary depending on location. Reports of upcoming changes come after the company has made other changes to its workforce, including ongoing worker readjustments and an updated PIP framework to more quickly exit underperforming workers. In July 2025, Microsoft laid off around 9,000 of its workers, and two months earlier in May a further 6,000 workers lost their jobs. Company CFO Amy Hood told workers in an internal memo (see by Business Insider) that they should prepare for another year of "intensity."

"We're entering FY26 with clear priorities in security, quality, and AI transformation, building on our momentum and grounded in our mission and growth-mindset culture," she added. Although the company has undergone major layoffs in recent months, hiring efforts in other areas and a broader restructuring has seen minimal changes to actual overall headcount. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said the layoffs had been "weighing heavily" on him, likening the ongoing transformation to that of the 1990s, when PCs and software became democratized, blaming the shifts on evolving customer needs. Microsoft told us that it is looking at refreshing its flexible working guidelines, as it has done many times before. The company has a page dedicated to its flexible work approach, which reads "No 'one size fits all'."

Title: Computer Science Graduates Struggle to Find Jobs During Tech Layoffs and AI Boom

Despite years of promises from tech leaders about lucrative coding careers, recent computer science graduates are facing a challenging job market due to the rise of AI programming tools and widespread layoffs in the tech industry. Some are taking jobs at fast food restaurants while they plan their next move. The New York Times reports that the allure of high-paying tech jobs has driven a surge in computer science education over the past decade, with the number of undergraduates majoring in the field more than doubling since 2014. Tech executives have long touted coding skills as a golden ticket to economic success, promising six-figure starting salaries and generous perks to those who pursue computer science degrees. However, the reality for many recent graduates is far less rosy. The spread of AI programming tools that can rapidly generate code, combined with significant layoffs at major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, has dimmed prospects for those seeking entry-level positions in the industry. Among college graduates aged 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent respectively — more than double the rate for biology and art history graduates. As Breitbart News has previously reported, another factor impacting the hire of new grads at tech companies is the influx of H-1B visa workers from India and China even as the companies lay off American workers: According to data compiled by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, Microsoft has applied for 4,712 H-1B visas in the 2025 fiscal year alone. However, anecdotal evidence from former employees and industry insiders suggests that the actual number may be closer to 6,000, although this figure has not been independently verified. The use of H-1B visas by large corporations has long been a contentious issue, with critics arguing that they allow companies to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Supporters of the program, however, maintain that it enables businesses to attract top talent from around the world and remain competitive in a global marketplace. Microsoft’s history of H-1B visa applications aligns with this perspective, as the company filed 9,491 applications in the 2024 fiscal year, with nearly all of them being approved. In response to questions from the Times, more than 150 college students and recent graduates from state schools including the universities of Maryland, Texas and Washington, as well as private universities like Cornell and Stanford, shared their experiences trying to get a job. Some claim to have applied to hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of tech jobs at companies, nonprofits and government agencies. Graduates from prestigious universities and state schools alike report facing a grueling process of coding assessments, technical interviews, and ultimately, rejection. Many describe the job search experience as “demoralizing,” “disheartening,” and “soul-crushing,” with some feeling “gaslit” by the tech industry about their career prospects. Some recent grads have even resorted to taking fast food jobs to generate income as they continue to pursue a career aligned with their major. One respondent said Chipotle was the only company that actually replied to her application, while another was rejected by McDonald’s for lacking experience. The rise of AI coding assistants is a particular concern for the students, as these tools reduce the need for companies to hire junior software engineers. Entry-level positions are now the most likely to be automated, leaving new graduates struggling to find a foothold in the industry. Additionally, many universities are just beginning to train students on these cutting-edge AI tools, putting recent graduates at a disadvantage. Job seekers feel they are caught in an AI “doom loop,” using specialized tools to mass-apply to positions while companies deploy AI systems to automatically screen resumes and reject candidates. Even government tech jobs, once seen as a stable alternative, have become more difficult to secure due to cutbacks and hiring freezes. As the job market shifts, some graduates are pivoting to other areas of the tech industry, such as marketing and sales, or highlighting their uniquely human skills like creativity. Others remain determined to pursue software engineering roles, building personal projects to showcase their abilities to potential employers. Read more at the New York Times here.

Title: Ford to build EV pickup with a starting price of $30K in bid to catch China rivals
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/08/11/business/ford-to-build-ev-pickup-with-a-starting-price-of-30k/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T15:44:33Z
Full Content:
Ford plans to start rolling out its new family of affordable electric vehicles in 2027, including a midsize pickup truck with a target starting price of $30,000, the company said on Monday, as it aspires to the cost efficiency of Chinese rivals. The new midsize four-door pickup will be assembled at the automaker’s Louisville, Ky., plant. Ford is investing nearly $2 billion in the plant, which produces the Escape and Lincoln Corsair, retaining at least 2,200 jobs, it said in a statement. Chinese carmakers such as BYD have streamlined their supply chain and production system to produce EVs at a fraction of the cost of Western automakers. While these vehicles have yet to enter the US market, Ford CEO Jim Farley said they set a new standard that companies like Ford must match. “I can’t tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right,” Farley told a crowd at Ford’s Louisville assembly plant on Monday, noting that past efforts by US automakers to build affordable cars had fizzled. “It is a bet. There is risk.” Ford has been developing its affordable EVs through its so-called skunkworks team, filled with talent from EV rivals Tesla and Rivian. The California-based group, led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke, has set itself so much apart from the larger Ford enterprise that Farley said even his badge could not get him into its building for some time. EVs sold for an average of about $47,000 in June, J.D. Power data showed. Many Chinese models sell for $10,000 to $25,000. Affordability is a top concern among EV shoppers, auto executives have said, and the global competition for delivering cheaper electric models is heating up. EV startup Slate, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is aiming for a starting price in the mid-$20,000s for its electric pickup. Tesla has teased a cheaper model, with production ramping up later this year. Rivian and Lucid are also planning to roll out lower-priced models for their lineups, although price points are in the $40,000s to $50,000s. Since rolling out plans earlier this decade to push hard into EVs, Ford has pulled back as the losses piled up. It has scaled back many of its EV goals, canceled an electric three-row SUV, and axed a program to develop a more advanced electrical architecture for future models. Ford last year announced it would start building its midsize truck from the skunkworks team in 2027. The automaker earlier this year estimated losing up to $5.5 billion on its EV and software division. It lost nearly $10 billion combined on those operations from 2023 to 2024. Cutting costs on battery-powered models has been one of the primary goals of Farley, who has said he expects this new family of EVs to be profitable within one year. Ford sells three EVs in the US: the Mustang Mach-E SUV, E-Transit van, and F-150 Lightning pickup. Sales of those vehicles fell 12% in the first half from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, interest in hybrids has surged, with sales up 27% over the same window. Ford recently pushed back production of its next-generation F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to 2028. The elimination of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, loosening regulations on emissions and reduced funding for charging infrastructure are expected to further dampen demand. All this makes it more important for automakers to pick their lanes, Farley has said. “The pure EV market in the US seems to us very clear: small vehicles used for commuting and around town,” Farley told analysts on an earnings call last month. By contrast, crosstown rival General Motors has electrified vehicles across its entire lineup, from the hulking Hummer to the smaller Equinox SUV. GM spent more time upfront building a ground-up platform as a base for its EV models. Meanwhile, Ford has reconfigured many of its popular gasoline-powered vehicles with batteries to get to market sooner, delaying the development and launch of a unified EV platform, details of which it unveiled on Monday. While being out front has exposed Ford to more EV demand fluctuations over the past two years, it has also learned more about the market, Farley has said. Ford is using lithium-iron-phosphate, or LFP batteries, for the forthcoming family of EVs. The batteries are produced in Marshall, Mich., using technology from Chinese EV-battery maker CATL that has helped to bring down the sticker price of electric cars. Advertisement

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Wall Street traders embraced the term TACO — Trump always chickens out — earlier this year to describe President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again position on tariffs. Trump liked to impose hefty import taxes but would inevitably back off when markets plunged, analysts said. Now Trump is calling the market’s bluff. Yet another round of new tariffs went effect on Thursday, lifting the average tax on US imports to the highest level since the 1930s. Trump bet markets would absorb this latest news, adapt and move on — and so far he appears to have been right. Stocks still closed higher on the week, with the Nasdaq hitting a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 notching its best week in over one month. It’s a remarkable shift from early April, when the president’s “Liberation Day” tariffs caused stocks across the globe to plunge. But with economists saying tariff effects could take weeks or months to play out, it’s too soon to declare victory just yet. “He is succeeding in implementing major tariffs without shocking the stock market,” said Ethan Harris, former head of global economics at Bank of America. “It’s surprising, and you could call it an accomplishment if you’re in favor of tariffs.” Trump may be winning the hand, but Wall Street has lots of cards left. The game isn’t over. Investors in recent months have embraced the “TACO” trade. A better description would be, “Trump always tries again,” according to Harris. With the latest import taxes, Trump is pushing forward with an average tariff rate just slightly slower than what he tried to impose on April 2, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. While stocks are hovering near record highs, Harris said he expects tariffs will inflict “real damage” on the economy, and it remains to be seen if investors will stay complacent. The inclusion of carveouts has softened the blow of tariffs, according to Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income at UBS. That has helped temper investors’ concerns. Apple (AAPL), for example, is exempt from tariffs on some imports from India and tariffs on semiconductors because of its pledge to develop production in the United States. Apple stock last week soared 13% and had its best week since 2020. “The tariff wall being built by the administration also has many holes because of numerous product exemptions, carveouts and delayed implementation dates,” Reiman said. Enthusiasm about the AI boom in the United States is also driving market momentum and drawing attention away from tariffs. While investors have been concerned about trade, blowout earnings from big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) have helped buoy the market. In addition, trading partners have largely not retaliated, avoiding a global trade war that would have had worse outcomes for the US economy, according to David Doyle, head of economics at Macquarie. “What’s really struck me is how little Trump has had to chicken out from,” Robert Armstrong, the Financial Times columnist who coined the term “TACO,” told CNN’s Richard Quest in an August 1 interview. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, spiked in early April above 50 points — a historic level not seen since the Covid pandemic or the 2008 financial crisis. The VIX in August just briefly breached 20 points — a level associated with slightly noticeable volatility — before retreating. Investors are maintaining faith in a “Trump put,” or the notion that if the markets do plummet, the president will refine his approach. The “Trump put” is different from chickening out, analysts say, as the president might back down just enough to satisfy markets before pushing forward again with his tariffs when he is able to. “He always tries again until the equity market punishes the policy,” Harris said. “That’s the old ‘Trump put’ idea, which is the way people used to talk about it, and is still the correct way to think about the trade war.” While Trump has implemented his tariffs, it might be too soon to call victory. Investors are awaiting data on inflation and the labor market in upcoming months to get a better sense of how tariffs are impacting the economy. “As an investor, you can talk yourself into not worrying about tariffs, but if you’re a company trying to make business plans, you can’t afford to ignore the tariffs,” Harris said. “The stock market and the economy are not the same thing.” Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said investors are taking two leaps of faith in believing in the resilience of the US economy and that “the stagflationary impulse of tariffs” — slower growth and stickier inflation — won’t be as bad as initially feared. Markets are a “little too complacent,” Sai said, and he will be watching the next two inflation reports ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting for any sign of tariff-induced increases in prices. “By no means are we out of the woods,” Sai said. “ We are priced for nothing to go wrong, and yet we still have a very important inflection point ahead of us.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: S4 confirms MSQ merger talks – here’s why a deal could tempt both parties

Advertisement August 11, 2025 | 7 min read Listen to article 4 min Barry Dudley of Green Square dissects the fledgling talks between S4 Capital and MSQ Partners, exploring strategic fit, the market forces driving the potential deal and what it could mean for Sir Martin Sorrell’s “new-age” marketing group after a turbulent few years. Sir Martin Sorrell founded S4 Capital in 2018 after leaving WPP S4 Capital, Sir Martin Sorrell’s ‘new-age’ digital marketing group, has confirmed that it is in very preliminary deal talks with MSQ Partners, the creative and technology agency network that is majority-owned by US private equity firm One Equity Partners (OEP). The potential deal – which S4 says would be structured as an acquisition of MSQ by S4 Capital rather than a takeover of S4 – comes after a bruising period for the group. S4’s share price has fallen more than 90% from its peak only a few years ago. The current market capitalization sits at around £140m, a fraction of the multibillion pound valuation it once enjoyed. I’ve heard rumors and seen reports of other interested parties in the past, including the likes of Stagwell, New Mountain Capital and Accenture. I suspect Sir Martin has had many conversations come at him, or indeed he has sought them. Probably even more are incoming right now. S4 Capital was founded in 2018 after Sorrell’s high-profile exit from WPP. Built on aggressive M&A, it focused on digital content production, programmatic advertising and data-driven marketing through acquisitions such as MediaMonks and MightyHive. Its client base reads like a tech-sector who’s-who: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta to name just a few. However, that narrow tech focus has been a double-edged sword. When the sector tightened budgets and many reallocated spend towards AI investments, S4’s revenues took a hit – compounded by accounting missteps, economic headwinds and rising interest rates. MSQ Partners, on the other hand, offers a broader spread of clients – more than 250, including Unilever, Haleon, Lego, P&G and Booking.com – across consumer goods, healthcare, financial services and B2B. It operates through a decentralized network of specialist agencies spanning advertising, PR, design, digital, and tech. Since being acquired by OEP in 2023, MSQ has invested in integrated, creative-plus-tech delivery models. We recently advised Precious Media, a connected commerce digital agency, on its sale to MSQ. So how could they fit: Complementary client bases – S4 is over-indexed to tech; MSQ brings balance through FMCG, healthcare, and finance. Capability cross-sell – MSQ’s creative brand-building could bolster S4’s digital execution; S4’s programmatic and data expertise could sharpen MSQ’s digital performance offering. Geographic scale – S4’s US and APAC strength could mesh with MSQ’s European roots, giving a broader footprint without heavy duplication. AI positioning – Both have leaned into AI narratives, but a combined group could pool their R&D resources. Advertisement The marketing services sector is undergoing its biggest structural shift since the holding-company era of the 80s and 90s. AI is reshaping creative workflows, media buying and data analytics. Clients are consolidating their agency rosters, looking for faster, integrated delivery. The network groups have been re-engineering their own businesses to face this new way of working, with WPP recently merging its media offer under one brand. All are focussed on, and investing in, AI to help them deliver across media, creative and processes. But these are big legacy firms… and big ships can find it notoriously difficult to change course quickly. This has created fertile ground for private equity–backed roll-ups and mergers of complementary mid-scale networks. We’ve seen a plethora of PE firms coming into the market and appetite isn’t abating. For OEP, combining MSQ with S4 could create another top-tier independent rival, not only to snap at the heels of the mega groups, but also some of the smaller challenger brands and the other PE-backed indies. It could also give MSQ more muscle in terms of its own future expansion, both geographically and in terms of capability infills it may need. Advertisement Will OEP take it off the stock market? I suspect it will, not least because it removes that historical peak – which was arguably a significant over-valuation – which will otherwise be a benchmark that continues to be referenced under the current listing. That said, maintaining the listing could open up other options in terms of financing future acquisitions. And where will Sir Martin end up if this goes through? His voting control and personal stake mean no deal happens without him seeing a clear path for himself. Wherever things go, he looks set for another defining chapter in his career. Or will he head for the beach, which is where I am right now… Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

August 11, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Tim Ferriss on The Productivity Mindset, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio News. This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Yes, I know I say I have an extra special guest every week. This week I have an extra, extra special guest, Tim Ferriss bestselling author of numerous books, including the Four Hour Work Week host of the Tim Ferriss podcast. He’s got a bajillion downloads on that. He’s written five number one bestselling books, including Tools of the Titans. He also has a new card game out called Coyote, which is getting a lot of buzz. He co-created this with a another gaming company called Exploding Kittens. You probably know Tim from some of his books or, or conversations or Ted Talks or what have you. I found him to just be such a thoughtful guy. He is really the chief scientist of his own experiment, the the Tim Ferriss experiment, where he’s constantly trying to figure out how his body works, how his psychology works, how his emotional world works, and has tried a variety of different things and sort of fastidiously documented what does and doesn’t work for him. That’s what led to his productivity book, the Four Hour Work Week. It’s what led to his health and fitness book, the Four Hour Body, on and on. He just tries a whole bunch of things, figures out, does the ab tests, figures out what works and what doesn’t. I thought this conversation was fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my discussion with Tim Ferriss. Tim Ferriss: Thanks for having me. Nice to be here. Barry Ritholtz: Well, it, it’s nice to have a fellow podcaster in here. I don’t, I don’t have to explain how this rolls. I, what I wanna do is I’m, I’m excited about your book. I know you have a new game out that we want to talk about, but I have to start by delving into your background, which is really fascinating. Bachelor’s in East Asian studies from Princeton. What, what were the original career plans? Tim Ferriss: So that was after a major switch. So the original career plan was actually neuroscience. Oh, kidding. So I was kidding. A neuroscience major. And there were a few reasons I wanted to focus on that. I have Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s and hereditary bipolar and so on in my family. Barry Ritholtz: So, wait, we, we could have a whole ‘nother discussion on Neurodivergency and, and I was kind of fascinated by a lot of what you have done seemed to be hacks to manage and operate around whatever deficits you’re working with. Some deficits come with separate surpluses, but how significant were all these deficits to forcing you to come up with a methodology of just navigating life? Tim Ferriss: Well, the depression piece was a huge challenge for most of my life, and thankfully that has changed with a couple of different approaches and different tools, and that’s one of the drivers for the initial neuroscience. And there was someone in the Department of Psychology, but within the focus of neuroscience named Barry Jacobs at the time. And I was interested in Barry Jacobs as a possible mentor because he was focused on the role of serotonin and sleep and mood reg regulations and the neurobiology of depression. He also, and this was early days, he had of an interest in psychoactive substances, including LSD. So my, my interest in psychedelic compounds goes back a very, very long time. That would’ve been 19 95, 96, but I couldn’t personally do. I realized, and it is important and it is necessary at this point in time, the animal testing on rats used cats for a lot of the circadian rhythm studies, but I couldn’t euthanize these rats after doing various tests. And it wasn’t actually torture of any type. I just couldn’t, I couldn’t be hands-on with that at the time. So I switched to East Asian studies, but with a focus on mostly language acquisition. So I was still in the realm of let’s just say cognitive neuroscience, but more on the linguistic side. Danny Kahneman, I actually volunteered to be a research subject in a bunch of his studies. Barry Ritholtz: No kidding. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Just to see what that was like. But at, Barry Ritholtz: At the time, had he already won the Nobel and like, I think it was 01, 02, something like that? Tim Ferriss: No, not yet. Not yet. So this was super early days. Still very well known on campus, but I guess it would’ve been Green Hall. They were pretty boring, to be honest. The tasks hitting space bars or something to indicate when you see a flashing green right box in the upper left hand corner of one of these very old school monitors. But that was one of the ways that I earned whatever it was, $5 an hour to pay for some of my expenses in Princeton? Barry Ritholtz: I kind of remember he was at Princeton and then Vancouver and then California. So my maybe, yeah, he Tim Ferriss: Bounced around, but at that time Princeton. Barry Ritholtz: Really, really interesting. So I get the transition, I guess if you’re gonna pick some space related to neuroscience, Asian studies can occasionally overlap with that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and I had been an exchange student. My first real trip outside of the US was an exchange student at age 15 to Tokyo, Japan. Amazing. Where I went to a Japanese school for a year. Barry Ritholtz: Are you fluent at all? Tim Ferriss: I am, yes. I still speak read less. So write, because you really have to practice that to keep it up. I can still speak and read Japanese and then got a couple of others. Barry Ritholtz: , I have a friend Noah Smith, who is physics and economics, like a killer double major. And he spent summers in, in raves Kyoto. Says Tokyo, you have to go. And that must have been fascinating at 15. That has to be a little overwhelming. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It’s a, it’s a fascinating very, for someone who grew up on Long Island and Barry Ritholtz: That’s right, you’re an East Hampton kid, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And at that point, I only spoke English very alien. It has the benefit of being incredibly alien, but incredibly safe. And the additional benefit that people tend to speak if they speak at all terrible English, which means you have to learn Japanese. Huh. So in contrast with a lot of, if you go to Spain or if you go to Norway, good luck learning Norwegian because people are gonna default to English. That just doesn’t really happen in Japan. So, not to mention the fact that I got there before smartphones, so I couldn’t just escape to texting with my friends. I was stuck. Barry Ritholtz: Use Google Translate to actually talk to people!? Tim Ferriss: Didn’t exist. Yeah. You were stuck. And that was a huge, huge benefit. So that is another reason, actually another reason why I chose Princeton was because it had the, one of the strongest, if not the strongest East Asian studies programs for at that time I was most interested in Japanese and Chinese, which I would’ve taken even if I had majored in neuroscience. Barry Ritholtz: So you graduate in 2000. I’m kind of fascinated that very quickly you start writing the four hour work week, which was published in oh seven, like that is a shockingly short period of time. You’re in your twenties. Yeah. When you’re selling what essentially becomes one of the top selling books of oh seven, I mean, it was on every bestseller list. I don’t have to tell you this, but I want listeners to understand. So the first question is, what on earth motivated you five years outta college to say, I think I’m gonna write a book. 00:08:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So I actually explicitly never wanted to write anything. This was a commitment I made to myself after graduation longer than an email ever. Again. That was the promise, because my senior thesis, I felt almost killed me. So I didn’t want to write anything. But one of my professors at Princeton who really changed the trajectory of my life, a professor named Ed Chao, Z-S-C-H-A-U, we’re still in touch. He was a former competitive figure skater took companies public, one of the first computer science professors at Stanford. He did everything taught at Harvard Business School, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Real polymath, Renaissance man. And he taught a class called High Tech Entrepreneurship, which was electrical engineering 4 91. But you didn’t need to be an engineer. I wasn’t. And that class is what convinced me to move west. Keep in mind the timing. This was just before the dotcom implosion to kinda chase my riches and engage in tech. 00:09:10 And in 2001, after that startup I joined, had imploded. I started my own company and I was bootstrapping it. I didn’t raise any outside financing. And so Ed asked me to come back and talk to students about bootstrapping. So I went back twice a year to do this short lecture to students. And in one of the feedback forms, after years of doing this, one of the students who was not being serious, put in his additional comments, I don’t understand why you’re teaching a class of undergrads and graduate students. Why don’t you just write a book and be done with it? And I had really bad insomnia for decades, including at that time. So I would get these half-baked ideas for chapter titles or content or whatever, and I couldn’t get to sleep. And I would just jot it down and the notes from the classes I was teaching, which changed over time to track my experiences and these insomnia, middle of the night notes, formed the backbone of something, sent it to a mentor of mine who was an author. And unbidden, without asking me, was like, I think this is a great idea here. Meet so-and-so meet So-and-so, introduced me to various editors and agents. Keeping in mind now looking back, 28 or 29 publishers, meaning imprints said no. And then Crown bought it for next to nothing. I 00:10:35 [Speaker Changed] I love all the examples. I’m a big William Goldman fan whose book and ventures in the screen trade Oh, amazing. Introduce the phrase, nobody knows anything into the popular culture. And he talks about all the studios passed on Star Wars. All the studios passed on Raiders. Was it paramount that passed on? ET ’cause hey, we have this other alien adventure called Starman. Nobody remembers today. And, and you could go to other, 00:11:05 [Speaker Changed] You can go anywhere, fields, Starbucks, everybody passed on Starbucks 00:11:09 [Speaker Changed] Squid Games. The author couldn’t get it sold for 10 years. Yeah. Ultimately had to sell his laptop. Yeah. ’cause he was so broke. I love the John Wick story. He you have like this Yeah. Top Action Hero could not get Hong Kong gun fu made in Hollywood. Ended up funding it himself along with, I’m trying to remember the other actress who kicked money in and it’s now a $2 billion franchise. Yeah. So love those. So bestselling book that all the imprints passed on. Not a surprise at all. Yeah. It is a throw everything against the wall business model and we don’t care. And we’ll see what sticks and they miss this. 00:11:48 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s a, it’s a hits driven business in some ways. Very similar to the Angel investing later. I mean Sure. This type of kind of power law distribution. And the, what’s been wildest about the Four Hour Work Week, which is, is really a book on increasing per hour output, which is why it found a, a toehold in tech. And then the first New York Times coverage had Mark Andreessen, the famed entrepreneur, and now venture capitalist talking about it. He wants to work 80 hours a week, but he wants to get each of those hours to produce 10 times as much. And that’s the basic underlying theme of the book. So what’s wild about it is almost all the tech tools that I recommend and additional resources have expired. But even in 2017 when all of that stuff was irrelevant, the principles, the frameworks and so on, it ended up being on the Amazon top 10 most highlighted books of all time list in two 00:12:46 [Speaker Changed] Meaning from the Kindle version is what’s 00:12:48 [Speaker Changed] So highlighted. Yeah. In 2017. So that would’ve been eight years later when all of the tech tools were just dinosaurs at that point, which has been, it’s been cool to watch. So, 00:12:59 [Speaker Changed] So, so I have, I’m thumbing through the book over the weekend. I read it way back when, and I’m revisiting an old copy, which I should have brought in to have you sign. And my wife says, four hour work week. What’s she, she’s an art teacher, fashion, illustration, and design. She’s like, what’s that about? And I say, I know this is not gonna be a conversation that’s gonna go any place productive. So I just say the Pato principle. Mm. She’s like, what’s that? Well, 80% of the value we derive from most activities, clients, effort, whatever comes from 20% of whatever that data set is. And she’s like, oh, is that true? I’m like, yeah, kind of really seems to be true. Oh, okay. And I know immediately like, this is not her sort of book, but how grossly am I oversimplifying the four hour work week by just reducing it to open principle? 00:13:54 [Speaker Changed] I think if you had to pick one principle in the book, that’s a good one. 00:13:56 [Speaker Changed] That’s it. Right. 00:13:57 [Speaker Changed] To focus on. Now it assumes a few things that sometimes get missed. Right? So people can jump to strategy before they really interrogate their direction or reasons for doing something. So the definition phase of that book where you’re really getting very clear on which target you are aiming for, I think is a, might sound strange, but an often underemphasized precursor to then doing an 80 20 analysis. Because for 80 20 or Pareto principle analysis, you’re looking at which 20% of the inputs roughly right? It could be 10, it could be 1% are producing the outsized percentage of the returns. Now that could be looking at your customers if you run a business, right? It could be looking at your physical exercise, what’s producing the adaptations. That’s a little trickier to do, but you can figure it out. You could look at it with medications too. I mean, it’s like, there are a lot of ways to apply it. And Vilfredo, Pareto noticed this in everything from agriculture and like pea production to wealth distribution. It applies all over the place. And actually Richard Kosh, KOCH has written a a lot on this subject under the moniker of the 80 20 principle. But I’d say if you had to pick one principle, that’s the one. Sure. 00:15:22 [Speaker Changed] Since we’re sitting here in Bloomberg, I, I just have to point out, it’s very much true for your portfolio. The vast majority of your gains. And if you read some of the research by people like Bess Binder, Hendrick, Bess Binder in Arizona State, it’s not even 20% that’s generating returns. It’s one or 2%. Yeah. That creates the vast majority. So there’s Pareto principle, hyper pato principle, but it’s kind of fascinating that you use this as a way to hack your own productivity, effectiveness, comfort level, mental health. Like you’ve applied this across a wide range of items. Have you ever found a space where it doesn’t work? 00:16:05 [Speaker Changed] I haven’t, to be honest. It’s, 00:16:07 [Speaker Changed] It’s just consistent 00:16:08 [Speaker Changed] Everywhere. It seems to be practically a law of nature that a few things. The the critical few versus the trivial many, it’s, it’s almost always a few things. 00:16:19 [Speaker Changed] The critical few versus the trivial many. Yeah. That, that is a fabulous summation of that. Yeah. I really, I really like that. So let’s, let’s stick with the book for a moment. Sure. In the book, you have a lot of practices and tools and routines. I know some of them are, are still valid today. Some of them may or may not have, for lack of a better word, expired. What were the most important items you learned? What are the ones that people speak to you and say, Hey, this resonated. This really had a big impact on me? 00:16:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I would say the first is, well, let me zoom out and say that I, I went back and I looked at the book, which is always tough for me on some level. ’cause I, I, I published it when I was 29, right? I’m turning 48 soon. And so there’s, there’s a little bit of chest puffing and so on. ’cause I was completely unknown at the time, which makes me wince. But overall, the principles are still things that I apply all the time. But the tech tools, like using go to my pc, no, of course not. That’s changed. That world has changed. But the principles and the, the frameworks, the exercises still apply. So there I would say a few things get echoed to me a lot. One is the practice of fear, setting fear, 00:17:38 [Speaker Changed] Fear setting, define fear setting for the audience. Sure. 00:17:41 [Speaker Changed] It’s very simple. So fear setting is based on the, I think, accurate assumption that oftentimes we are taught to set goals or we have a framework for trying to set goals like smart, right. Specific, measurable, et cetera, with a timeline. But if you have the emergency break on with some set of amorphous fears about starting a business, quitting your job, getting engaged, getting divorced, taking a vacation from your job or your business, whatever it might be, that that is the kind of rate limiter. And what you can do, and people can find this for free, if you just go to watch my TED talk, which has, I don’t know, 12 million views now, 00:18:26 [Speaker Changed] 18 tight minutes of here’s what to do with your life. 00:18:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s, well, it just focuses on this exercise of fear setting, which I still do probably once a quarter. And the basic idea is you take whatever you’re considering that you haven’t yet done because you have some degree of fear or apprehension. You write down all of the worst things that could happen. Let’s just call it a list of 20 in excruciating detail. Make them specific. Then you have another column, which is what you could do to minimize the likelihood of each of those things happening. Last column, if e each of those happened, what could you do to recover or temporarily stop the bleeding, right? So, okay, you try business after quitting your job, which by the way, I don’t recommend. You can moonlight and do various things to hedge against risk, but then it doesn’t work. Okay. Can you temporarily Airbnb a bedroom in your house or your bed? 00:19:17 Can you get a job bar attending just to get back on your feet? Sure. Of course you can. So when you start to do that, and then there’s a separate page where you also write out the costs of inaction, which is a neglected step. When people are considering what they’re doing, they look at the risks of doing something, but they don’t look at the risks of not doing that thing. So if you telescope out a year, three years, what are the financial, emotional, familial or relationship costs of not doing the thing you’re considering? And when you then look at these things, which represent your thoughts trapped on paper, a lot of people are able to do the scary thing. So I would say that that one gets echoed a lot. And then this concept of mini retirements. So engineering a way such that you can take four weeks completely off the grid or disconnected, which is very, very, very achievable. That seems 00:20:13 [Speaker Changed] Four weeks in a row or a week, every quarter, 00:20:16 [Speaker Changed] Like three to four weeks in a row. Wow. 00:20:18 [Speaker Changed] That’s a lot. 00:20:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And what that forces you to do also is upgrade your sort of systems and policies and automation in your life or in your business, or even in your job by teaching subordinates how to do things autonomously. And the value of all those things outlives the mini retirement. So I’d say those are two that come back a lot. 00:20:42 [Speaker Changed] It’s interesting that you are approaching, laying out the pros and cons and things that lead to fear in a new venture. I, I contextualize that a little differently. You and I have both interviewed Ray Dalio. Yeah. And Ray’s great innovation and and contribution to finance. Finance has this very much fake it till you make it attitude. Never admit error. No, no, it’ll be great. Don’t worry if it didn’t work out this year, it’ll work out next year. And Ray very much said, no, that’s wrong. We’re all gonna make mistakes. It’s really important to learn from those mistakes. And I wanna say he’s the first guy that really put that out at all. 00:21:25 [Speaker Changed] But I, not to not to mention the transparency of having almost all meetings recorded, accessible by anyone within his firm. I mean, 00:21:35 [Speaker Changed] Which is kind of horrifying. They 00:21:36 [Speaker Changed] Did some pretty wild stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He’s a fascinating character. A 00:21:40 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But it leads to the question, what you’re talking about is really a way to prep yourself for a fear of failure. Is, is that fair to describe it? And 00:21:54 [Speaker Changed] Sure. Yeah. Or you know what? It’s a fear of failure, but oftentimes it’s this, it’s the fact you achieve, well, very, it’s gonna be very, very hard to achieve your goals. If they’re not very specific and clear. Even if you fail partially, that’s fine. You can still do great things. I think the, the parallel is that if your fears are unclear, nebulous, it’s just a feeling in your gut, but you don’t trap the specifics on paper, they’re very difficult to overcome. They will still be a break in your life. It is just as important to address that as it is to address the goals, to identify those sort of sticking points. And I would also say that I think of risk for people is often ill-defined, and there are many ways in different contexts to define risk. But if we look at it as the likelihood of a irreversible negative outcome, very few things have a 10 out of 10 value in that category. 00:22:57 Right? And then if you look at, for instance, if you look at the, and I encourage people to do this in fear setting, it’s like, from zero to 10, transient, recoverable, or permanent. What is the potential upside of doing this scary thing that you’re considering doing? And then if you stay doing what you’re doing, like what are the zero to 10 permanent transient risks or potential outcomes of not doing the thing when, when you then see, oh, if I do this thing, there could be all of these potentially semi-permanent or permanent benefits. If I try it and fail, the downsides are transient and like three outta 10, it makes the decision much, much easier. And the decision is the hardest part. Once you commit, then it’s just execution risk and implementation. And it’s the decision that is the hardest part for most people. 00:23:47 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s amazing that everything you’re saying is so applicable to public markets investing. Yeah. Because when people are in that panic mode, when they’re fearful, oh my God, we’re down 15%, the world is gonna come to an end. It’s always, no, this is transitory, this is temporary. Yep. How can you avoid making those permanent losses? How can you avoid those decisions that lead to really bad outcomes? And it’s really understanding, hey, is this a 10 or is this more likely a 2, 3, 4 on that 00:24:18 [Speaker Changed] Scale? Yeah. And I can actually, I’ll give something else in the, in the investing world, if we’re looking at, when people neglect the other side of a coin, and this is not gonna apply to like these super ultra pros, but a lot of people who participate in the public markets, they think about what to buy, right? What’s a good buy at this moment? They don’t think about hold period. They don’t think about selling strategy. What will be the cues? What are the underlying sort of thesis if invalidated, that would mean they should sell blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They don’t have a structured way of thinking about selling. And similarly, it’s like, if you just think about your goal, but you don’t have a structured way of thinking about fear and apprehension and so on, you’re equally handicapped. So that would be an, an easy kind of copy paste comparison, I would say. Huh. 00:25:08 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. You come out of college with Asian language studies and then you write a book on productivity and personal efficiency. How did you then pivot to angel investing and or advising? 00:25:25 [Speaker Changed] So the pivot, I guess, was an overlap in a sense because the four hour work week, I was based in Silicon Valley for 17 years. And I seeded the four hour work week at Tech Heavy Events. In part because it talks about an information, low information diet, and selective ignorance, and basically overcoming digital overwhelm. That’s a component of the book. And that pain was most acutely felt by people in tech at the time. So my early adopters, plus the people I had access to were techies in the very early stages of figuring out how I would launch this book. And what that had as a side effect, was developing relationships with various founders. And there were a lot of fans among CEOs and co-founders of startups. 00:26:17 [Speaker Changed] Let me interrupt you, just to remind people. The book comes out in oh seven. Yep. This is before half of the companies that we think of as part of our daily lives. Oh. Well before were, you know, there was no public Alibaba, as I think that’s before Facebook, certainly long before Uber goes, goes public and Shopify, a lot of these companies were, you know, barely a gleam in the creator’s 00:26:42 [Speaker Changed] Eyes. Yeah. They didn’t, a lot of them either didn’t exist or they were very, very early stages. So I launched the book, my main launch strategy was South by Southwest, this festival in Austin, Texas in 2007, which was also the same south by Southwest, where Twitter basically went fully live in public, in full promotional mode. And the other piece of the story of angel investing is that I mentioned in the previous segment, my professor in school, ed Chao, his son-in-law at the time, Mike Maples Jr. Was a very well-known angel investor in Silicon Valley, had been an executive of various companies. And we became friendly. He wanted to lose some weight. I wanted to learn more about what he did. So we would have breakfast at this place called Hobies, and I would help him with his strategy for training and so on. At this point, also, the four hour work week could come outta nowhere and hit the New York loan up. Right. Hit the New York Times list, then went to number one and stayed on the New York Times list for four and a half years, or five years or something. That’s insane. And so he like 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Are, are you aware just of how lightning in a bottle that 00:27:51 [Speaker Changed] Is? Yeah. It’s bananas. It’s bananas. That’s part of the reason I haven’t wanted to go back and revise any of the writing. I’m like, I don’t wanna touch the butterfly and risk screwing it up. So he wanted to know how that happened. Like what did I do? And there were things I did for marketing and PR and so on to help catalyze that. And in exchange I’d say, tell me about your deals. What are you doing? I was always interested in investing. Eventually after a few months, all of these factors combined. I asked Mike and he was very generous with his time. If he might be open to me co-investing with him on some deals, very small checks, like I would put in 10 K so I wouldn’t eat up much of the cap table. I would put in a lot of work to try to help these companies. 00:28:33 And that is how the whole adventure started. I wanted to be the least expensive, most valuable person in terms of ratio on the cap table. So that those early founders would become my testimonials, basically for future deals. Very savvy. That’s how the whole thing started. And I decided to treat it like I would treat going to business school. I looked at Stanford at the time, ’cause I’d fantasized about going to Stanford Business School. I was like, okay, that’s 120 k over two years, I would’ve had to pay that outta pocket. So let me create the quote unquote Tim Ferris fund for Angel investing. It’s 120 K over two years, and I’m assuming that it’s sunk cost tuition, it’s gonna go to zero. None of the startups are gonna succeed. But if I can develop skills, learn a lot, and relationships that make it worthwhile, I’ll consider it a success. And that was the approach I took to doing it. And the timing was also great because I started in 2007, 2008, 2008 for a few years afterwards, was effectively considered a dotcom depression. Right. But that’s when I met Toby, the Shopify. Shopify, when they had nine employees or 12 employees Wow. And became an advisor. That’s when I started becoming involved with lots of companies of these very early stages, which ended up just to become these behemoths. 00:29:59 [Speaker Changed] I love your concept of this is a sun cost that’s going to zero. I think that’s the absolute right approach with startups. And you hinted at something that I, I have to explore a little bit. Anytime I throw money at a a small startup, it’s essentially a, this is gonna go to zero, but b, I really just want to invest in the jockey. I wanna put money into this person who, hey, this is easier than bearing a body. Yeah. Like, those are the two things I would do for this guy. Yeah. And a check. All right, I’ll, I’ll put a check into that. Yeah. And maybe it works out. I, I sense you have a similar belief in, you’re betting on, not on the horse, but the jockey 120 K is only 12 $10,000 checks. Yep. It’s not a lot. And I have to imagine there were a lot more opportunities. What criteria do you use to figure out who gets that check? Well 00:30:51 [Speaker Changed] Also, just as a side note, the reason I started trying to figure out advising and doing those agreements is that I ran outta money. I got over enthusiastic and I broke my own rules. And I think the first check I wrote was for like 40 K and immediately imploded. And I was like, uhoh, this is gonna be a problem. But leaving that aside, all of my best hits have been products that I would use personally that I could ideally be a power user of. And there have been a few exceptions, but by and large, they’re addressing problems that I feel acutely or needs that I feel or wants that I feel very acutely. So for instance, clear, how did Clear happen back in the day? It was called Clear Card and it was, it was not widely distributed. It was very little known. And I wrote a blog post back when blogs were a big deal. 00:31:45 And my blog at the time became very popular. And I wrote a huge piece on, on how to expedite travel. And a PA portion of that was about Clear card. I linked to their website and unbeknownst to me, I was one of the largest drivers of traffic to their website. And then at some point the leadership reached out to me and they said, Hey, do you wanna do something? And that’s how, that’s awesome. That relationship started. And I think I was the first advisor to clear, I mean, it was forever ago, so it must’ve been pretty 00:32:12 [Speaker Changed] Close. I wish they were in more airports just blown through JFK LaGuardia. It’s a blast with them. 00:32:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. They’ve done, they, they, from an execution perspective, they’ve been excellent. Also not based in Silicon Valley. And I, I don’t think that Silicon Valley’s the only place to go hunting for great companies. I mean, look at Shopify, Ottawa, Canada. Sure. Come on. That was Spotify, another one that was, that was neglected. So I also, so there were a few things. It was like, is it a problem or a need or a want that I feel and understand, is it something I can be a power user of? Therefore it makes it quite easy for me to promote to my audience. Could they be users or customers? And then lastly, for a while until this wasn’t viable, I looked for geographies that were neglected. So I actually, I went hunting in Canada a lot and works 00:32:57 [Speaker Changed] For comedy. Yeah, 00:32:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Or for Canadians. I mean, you look at some of the early experiences, like stumble upon, I was, I became an advisor to stumble upon and who was the founder of Stumble Upon, a guy named Garrett Camp. Stumble upon, I put tons of time into, he and I became close. We worked really well together. We enjoyed working together. Stumbled upon, ended up being a zero for me. But why is that? Okay. Because I, I talked about the relationships and the skills. Right? Okay. Relationship with Garrett Camp, what does he end up doing next? Co-founder of Uber, 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Not Too Shabby. Right. 00:33:32 [Speaker Changed] And then I was one of three people who had helped him with, stumble upon who became advisors to Uber Cab LLC at the time, which was I think 2008. 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] Oh 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] My God. By the way, everybody said no to Uber. Everybody. 00:33:46 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. That’s amazing to me because one of the things I find fascinating about VCs is they kind of put their failures on their websites as a badge of honor. Yeah. But it’s mostly, here are the companies we invested in that went belly up. They very rarely say, oh by the way, we passed on Uber, we passed on this, we passed on that. Yeah. You see less of that. 00:34:09 [Speaker Changed] You see less of it. And for me, I would say there’s lots of luck. But I was also trying to approach it in a systematic way. If you’re focused on effectively the way I would think about, let’s say I cut a $25,000 check. I’m like, okay, would I pay $25,000 just to develop these relationships and basically earn a graduate degree in whatever this startup is doing? If so, then great go. If not, then think twice. And taking that approach, all of the skills and the new knowledge and the relationships snowball over time. So I love highlighting failures that I would put in quotation marks because they’re actually just seeds and fertilizer for something that was intimately connected with the people and the skills that came right afterwards. This happens over and over and over again. So 00:35:04 [Speaker Changed] I’m, I’m hearing relationship, I’m hearing tuition for skills and then even quote unquote failures. You don’t know what act two is gonna be where it could go. 00:35:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And then lastly, I would say one thing I did quite differently, and maybe more people do this now, but I I had never heard of it, is I treated a portion of my total budget for that real world MBA slash you know, Tim Ferriss fund in quotation marks a portion of that for marketing budget. What does that mean? I invested in, I bought secondary, so I bought equity from employees at Facebook and Twitter. Now it ended up being very early, but to my mind at the time, they were overpriced. Super expensive. Huh. But being in those deals was coveted. So having a little bit of equity in those two companies allowed me to say, I’m in these companies. Which then helped bolster the reputation and assisted in getting new deals. So I expected those to go to zero. That’s marketing budget. Right. They ended up working out kinda very unexpectedly working out really well. But I expected those to go to zero and it was pure marketing budget. 00:36:17 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard you mention a book by Sebastian Alibi, the Power Law. 00:36:22 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Great book. 00:36:23 [Speaker Changed] Tell us a little bit about what you learned from that book about investing in startups. 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] That is a, a great book if you wanna learn about venture capital and angel investing. Most of the approaches I had already learned just by being in the trenches for whatever it was, a decade before that book came out, I was introduced to Sebastian through more Money than God. Yes. Which is his book about Yes. Hedge funds. That is an exceptional book. And if you want some colorful characters, oh my God, give that a read. 00:36:56 [Speaker Changed] Plus he’s British and his take on everything is just, 00:37:00 [Speaker Changed] It’s fantastic. 00:37:01 [Speaker Changed] It’s so dry and so delightfully humorous in an unintentional way. 00:37:05 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it’s so good. He’s, he’s a wonderful writer and very skilled at explaining. So what I would say about that book and what people might miss about startups is yes, it’s a hits driven business. There’s a power law distribution, meaning it’s pato principle on steroids. You’re probably gonna have one or two or three startups that give you the vast majority of your lifetime earnings, at least as an angel investor who’s not taking management fees. Right? Right. If you’re an asset accumulator and you have many, many, many overlapping billion dollar plus funds, like sure you’re gonna do great on management fees. 00:37:44 [Speaker Changed] VCs seem to do okay for themselves. It’s 00:37:47 [Speaker Changed] A pretty good business. Yeah. You have to be smart how, in how you approach it. But as an angel investor, I would say you need to have, if you’re gonna be effective in the long term, some coherent strategy or philosophy around portfolio construction so that you don’t run outta money. Right. It’s like staking someone in poker. It’s like you have to be able to sustain a string of bad luck. Right. And I would say that what Sebastian does so well is really detail how various MVPs in the world of venture capital have done that over time. And there, there are a few things I would point out also with respect to Silicon Valley that a lot of people miss. ’cause why did it happen in Silicon Valley? It’s like, sure, you can talk about like Fairchild Semiconductor, right. And I think it was the traitorous aid or whoever it was and all of this. 00:38:38 But why did that happen? Like why, why, why? I am always like ask why three times and you get to something interesting. Part of it is that non-competes are incredibly hard, if not close to, impossible to enforce in California. Yeah. What does that mean? It means that knowledge travels very freely. Talent travels very freely. So there’s a lot of competition and a lot of knowledge sharing sometimes to the chagrin of former employers. But that is part of the reason why Silicon Valley is still to this day it right now it would be the era of ai. If you wanna be in ai, if you really want to increase the likelihood of succeeding and you can raise enough money to pay for top talent, Silicon Valley’s still the place to be. Yeah. It’s not true for everything, but like it still matters. 00:39:24 [Speaker Changed] No, no, no doubt about it. So let’s stay with the concept of return on investments. I’m curious as to one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve made, but not in terms of monetary returns. In terms of, and I’m, I’m delving into your space in terms of time, energy, productivity, efficiency. What do you find to be the most productive, useful investments that you’ve made? 00:39:52 [Speaker Changed] There are quite a, quite a few. I would say anything related to mental health ranks very highly. And we, we could talk about some of the things that have benefited me. So I come from a family of people who have died from various types of addiction, bipolar depression, major depressive disorder. I struggled with probably, I would say three to four major depressive episodes a year for most of my life. That much. Wow. That’s a lot. And that’s that. And each episode ranging on the length of a few weeks to a few months. I mean, that is a lot of time in darkness. And now I’m at a point where it’s maybe one depressive episode of a few weeks every two to three years. Those are two completely different human experiences. How, how 00:40:40 [Speaker Changed] Did you manage to actually manage this? Because there are people who suffer from depression and that’s the word, suffer and never find a way to get on top of it. 00:40:51 [Speaker Changed] I’ll mention just a few things in the order I might suggest investigating them. One would be, let’s call it metabolic psychiatry. So looking at the work of Christopher Palmer, most recently out of Harvard, I’ve interviewed him on using diet to help mental health. And fundamentally it tends to end up being some version of a ketogenic diet. You can get a lot of those benefits by doing intermittent fasting. So let’s just say what I’m doing today and what I do a lot of the time, which is only eating between like 2:00 PM and 10:00 PM that’s an eight hour window. So you fast for 16 hours every day and your body adapts to that incredibly quickly. I would say within a week you’re pretty grumpy for a a week and then you’re fine. Then the next, so that was the metabolic psychiatry piece. The second would be different types of brain stimulation. Specifically something called accelerated TMS, which we could talk more about. People can investigate accelerated TMS and scientists named Nolan Williams out of Stanford. But this can change people over the course of five days. It’s remarkable. 00:42:01 [Speaker Changed] TMS standing for 00:42:02 [Speaker Changed] Transcranial magnetic stimulation. So it’s a type of brain stimulation and it, it takes something that looks like a large hockey puck and put it on your head. It’s non-invasive and it feels like someone’s kind of tapping your skull. And depending on if you’re trying to address anxiety or depression or OCD, the target can be different. And if people investigate accelerated TMS in some studies with major depressive disorder, complete remission in 70 to 80% of participants. Wow. And you might need a booster once a year. But compared to taking maintenance drugs every day with non-trivial side effects, accelerated TMS is fascinating. I encourage to be, to check it out there, there are a couple of different devices, but look for accelerated TMS and listen to someone like Nolan Williams. There’s a lot of nonsense floating around. The last one I would say is psychedelic assisted therapies. And I say that last because it’s 00:42:59 [Speaker Changed] Like microdosing of psilocybin or what have you, 00:43:01 [Speaker Changed] Microdosing or macro dosing, meaning most of the scientific literature. And I’ve funded a lot of this science since 2015 with my foundation. I put like double digits of my net worth into this philanthropically, which tells you how much I believe in it. The intermittent use could be once, it could be a few times. Various compounds could be say psilocybin in the case of major depressive disorder or different types of addiction like alcohol use disorder. N NYU is doing a lot of great work on that front. Or MDMA assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. I mean the results are 00:43:38 [Speaker Changed] Very strong. 00:43:39 [Speaker Changed] Mind blowing. Yeah. I mean you, you have complex PTSD people who’ve had, let’s just say an average length of diagnosis of 16, 17 years, which means many, many interventions have failed who do two or three sessions with therapists for MDMAs psychotherapy and they have effectively complete remission of symptoms. That’s 00:43:58 [Speaker Changed] Amazing. 00:43:58 [Speaker Changed] And it is, I believe there’s a psychotherapist named Stanis Leff gr quite legendary in the space who says, you know what the telescope was or is for astronomy, what the microscope is for biology psychedelics will be for the mind. Really. And I believe that these compounds in the study of these compounds, which has become very, very, very popular and de-stigmatized thankfully, will completely revolutionize how we think of neurobiology and psychiatry in, in treating some of these so-called incurable or intractable conditions, including things like anorexia. And many of the things I already mentioned, those would be three that I’d say have had a huge impact on me. And it’s, it’s seems boring. We could talk about it if you want, but exercise, I mean 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] I was waiting for you to bring that up. ’cause every study in the world says that’s the miracle cure for so much psychological challenges. And it’s not like you haven’t written about 00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] Exercise. Yeah. At all. Did a whole book on it. So yeah, the, the exercise, I’ll just mention two other things briefly. Cold exposure, and by the way, people have been using this for hundreds of years, but 00:45:13 [Speaker Changed] Certainly in the Swedish Nord countries. Oh yeah. It’s been, 00:45:17 [Speaker Changed] You know, forever. Yeah. Cold baths used to be prescribed for melancholy, AKA depression. And there is actually something to it. It could end up being after a few minutes when you shift from solely sympathetic nervous system activation fight or flight to parasympathetic could be actually stimulation of the vagus nerve. Who knows? It’s unclear at this point. But cold exposure matters like that, that is actually very reliable for mood elevation and seems to have some durability, which is wild exercise. People think of exercise and what you read about in the media a lot is like endorphins, endorphins, endorphins. Right. But that is not the full picture. If you wanna stave off Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, et cetera, or let me just broadly say neurodegenerative disease exercise provokes the release for something called Clotho, K-L-O-T-H-O, which people can investigate. And it is critical in staving off or or mitigating the onset and progression of, of these diseases. 00:46:15 So you have cloth endorphins. Sure. You have endorphins, you have endocannabinoids, cannabinoids. Sounds familiar. Like can like cannabis. Right, right. So those ha those can explain a lot both in terms of anti-inflammatory effects of some types of exercise. The, the benefits are just insane. So I would say follow Peter Attias advice. He’s credible, you know, trained at Stanford, Johns Hopkins in terms of zone two training. People can just look him up Zone two training a few times a week and then VO two max training, say once a week and some weight training. But the, if you didn’t do it for the physical benefits at all and just the cognitive benefits, including the release of things like brain drive, neurotrophic factor, that is also just a non-negotiable. 00:47:02 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned both Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s and Yeah, 00:47:07 [Speaker Changed] I have both in my family. Yeah. 00:47:08 [Speaker Changed] So that’s where I was gonna, the exact question I was gonna ask you were never diagnosed, you just have a genetic predisposition and you’re trying to proactively just get way out 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] Ahead of this. I’m trying to get ahead of it. Yeah. And unfortunately, you know, a lot of the Alzheimer’s treatments as just to use that, that that disease as, as an example, a lot of the, the interventions fail. I think some scientists would, would agree with this. Not necessarily because the interventions themselves can’t work, but because the interventions are too late. By the time people have really elevated levels of amyloid plaques and tau protein and so on, by the time they have moderate to severe symptoms, it might just be too late. But there is an argument to be made. I mean, it’s very rare that late intervention is better than early intervention. So 00:47:57 [Speaker Changed] I just saw a piece in National Geographic yesterday that was kind of fascinating. It may be possible to detect Alzheimer’s risk sooner as earlier as your twenties. Yeah. So there is some sort of research going on in the space that’s productive. You’re talking about something much more aggressive and individualized to, to take care of your preventative maintenance in advance of being diagnosed with this into your own hands. 00:48:26 [Speaker Changed] Right. And by the way, all the stuff I just mentioned that has helped me from a mental health perspective and physical perspective with insulin sensitivity and so on. Like I just did, you know, I’m about to turn 48, just did my, I do blood testing at least once a quarter and my most recent labs are my best. Yeah, I 00:48:43 [Speaker Changed] See. You just had some I just went to function health. Yeah. Are you familiar with function health? I dunno. Function health. So Silicon Valley startup, they have come up with a way, it’s not a healthcare company, it’s a technology company. And they say we want to take a hundred data point screens of your blood and look at all these different markers to create a baseline. We do this twice a year. Your doctor looks at 15, 20 things normally. Yeah. They’ll go a hundred. And by the way, depending on your genetic predisposition, check all these additional boxes for things like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia, et cetera. And so now you could check 150 data points and twice a year, especially if you are younger, alright, here’s a benchmark. And you’re creating this ongoing, for lack of a better word, horizontal set of data. And when something sort of spikes or is out of the normal range, you have a baseline that you could go back and, and work. I I literally did this Tuesday. Yeah, I yeah, I can see that. And I was like, oh, that’s a lot of blood, isn’t it? Like you, you, can you leave me a little, I got stuff to do later. But yeah, that in order to do a hundred different data series, they need a lot of different blood. 00:49:55 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. They need some blood. And I, I would say I don’t spend much money on stuff, but I do, I deliberately, some might say overspend on, on health, but what I was gonna say is the, the metabolic psychiatry, the less so accelerated TMS, but all, actually I, I should pull that back. TMS also can be applied to something like Alzheimer’s and psychedelic assisted therapies, the exercise, all of these and the cloth I mentioned specifically within exercise, all of those should in theory, help prevent or mitigate or delay the onset of, of some of these neurodegenerative diseases. So I am trying to get ahead of it. Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be hyper-personalized. Like these things have clinical data or published literature behind them. There’s still a lot of unknowns, but you can do these things now. 00:50:49 [Speaker Changed] So it’s so funny you say hyper-personalized. I, I’m speaking to a buddy who’s a, a psychologist. Hey, who do you have coming up on the show? Oh, this week I’m seeing Tim Ferris and he says, oh, I love Tim. He is, I love this line. He is the chief scientist of Tim Ferriss, the person. And I’m like, that is such a great way to describe it. Yeah, that’s true. You’ve basically created an entire business model around being the chief scientist of your physical health, your mental health, even your genetic health. W was this ever part of the original game plan or did just this just evolve over time? 00:51:33 [Speaker Changed] I’ve almost always been that way in part because I was born premature. I had a ton of health issues, still have issues with thermal regulation, chronic sinusitis, all these things that, 00:51:46 [Speaker Changed] Wait, thermal regulation being thermal regulation, always hot or 00:51:49 [Speaker Changed] Cold, can’t handle hot well, the way that my body handles hot and cold is strange. So I can overheat very easily. As an example, the reason that’s relevant is the one sport that my mom put me in that thanks to her that I could be somewhat successful at. When I was a little runt, I was very small swimming up until about sixth grade wasn’t swimming, it was wrestling because the puny kid gets to go against the other puny kid. But I would overheat really quickly, which meant I needed to try to win quickly before I would hit my red zone. And that just catalyzed all sorts of bizarre, huh? Self experimentation. 00:52:27 [Speaker Changed] That’s interesting. 00:52:28 [Speaker Changed] Learning how to weight cut to use like potassium sparing diuretic. The, the reason that I wanted to make Tim Ferriss lab, this n of one set of experiments was to win at wrestling. That’s how it started. Huh. And then I realized, wait a second, you might be able to apply this stuff to the brain. And then in college I started experimenting with all sorts of stuff. Nothing illegal, but lots of weird stuff that was, I was using kind of off-label like hydrogen, various nootropics and so on. And they did have an effect, like they did have an effect on memory and cognition. Things like desmopressin for short term memory, for memorizing Chinese characters. Like that stuff worked right there. There’s no biological free lunch with that stuff. So 00:53:12 [Speaker Changed] What are the, why no free lunch? What’s the side effect? Well, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] You do pay, you do pay a price. I would just say a, a couple of quick tips for health tracking and so on, and I’m not a doctor, I don’t play one on the internet. But number one, since you mentioned it earlier, is I get blood tests done once a quarter at, at the very least. Now why is that? Well, I want more frame as high a frame rate as possible to look at trends. But separately, I wanna catch things early if I need to catch things. But I would say that if you do infrequent blood tests, the risk is that you get one set of lab results back and you make a ton of big decisions based on those labs. Here’s what I’ll say. There are lab errors all the time. And if you’re gonna do consistent blood tests, consistent is, is, is the key. In other words, do it on the same day of the week at the same time. Oh 00:54:05 [Speaker Changed] Really? Yes. I would not have guessed that. 00:54:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s interesting because your testosterone has diurnal, it has. 00:54:11 [Speaker Changed] So the quest diagnostics as an example. Yeah. Don’t eat, don’t take supplements, don’t take any meds, whatever’s on your, your prescription lists. Stop the night before unless your doctor says don’t stop. Yeah. Follow 00:54:23 [Speaker Changed] Your doctor. But I’m saying if you measure your, 00:54:24 [Speaker Changed] But like you’re saying Monday at 10 is more important than, how significant 00:54:29 [Speaker Changed] Is that? Just be consistent because wow, if you, let’s just say you drink on the weekends and then you do your lab test on Monday morning versus doing it on Wednesday morning, some of your results might be different 00:54:39 [Speaker Changed] Of course. I mean that’s 00:54:40 [Speaker Changed] Obvious, but No, that’s, it’s not obvious to people because then really then they might have, after a weekend with birthday party with a friend and drinking, they have elevated liver enzymes like a LT or a sd, right? All of a sudden doctor only sees it once a year. He has no idea of the context. That’s fair. Testosterone, all these things can vary tremendously. And there are lab errors. So I would say before 00:55:02 [Speaker Changed] You, plus you also just get the regular noise and range and Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you’re low normal, sometimes you’re high normal, but it’s all, nothing is flatlined over time. Yeah. 00:55:13 [Speaker Changed] There’s gonna be normal variation. So I, I would just say that I’ll, I’ll keep it to one piece for now. Like really, if you’re about to get on a bunch of meds, unless it’s an emergency, look, there are emergencies that you need to deal with. But if it’s like, okay, you have this problem, we’re gonna put you on this med for the next year, before you do that, do the test again. Just get another blood test. Two days, two days later. 00:55:35 [Speaker Changed] Second opinion, 00:55:36 [Speaker Changed] Just confirm it. Huh. And again, not a doctor, not medical advice, informational purpose is only blah, blah, blah. But there 00:55:42 [Speaker Changed] You go. Dumb question. All the stuff you’ve done, game creation is not on your cv. Why did you decide to create a 00:55:52 [Speaker Changed] Game? Yeah, it seems like a total non sequitur. So a few reasons. Number one, I grew up feeling like I was saved by games specifically Dungeons and Dragons. 00:56:04 [Speaker Changed] Well, I know a ton. I have a ton of friends, many of whom were neurodivergent and d and d was a lifeline. Lifeline, 00:56:13 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely lifeline. So I, I may be pretty squarely in the neurodivergent camp. I’m not sure. 00:56:17 [Speaker Changed] Do you still play? 00:56:18 [Speaker Changed] I don’t, but here’s why 00:56:20 [Speaker Changed] I, I know plenty of guys. 40, 50. Yeah. Weekly games. Forget poker. It’s, 00:56:24 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s too much of a commitment for me now initially. So I’ve always wanted to make a game that could help produce the magic and joy and frankly, I mean, sort of the like cognitive training of d and DI think DD is just an incredible game. Kudos to, you know, TSR and Gary Ax and everybody who’s, who’s created that game. It’s unreal. But if you’re gonna be serious about DD, it’s like being serious about World of Warcraft, right? Like this is your new part-time job. Yeah. I mean, it’s many, many, many hours. So as someone now who’s like, everybody else got a lot going on, maybe I have a dinner with friends and we have an hour afterwards, there’s no way we’re gonna play d and d, right? There’s no way we’re gonna play a complex board game. I was curious to see though, if I could create something, and a lot of the, the podcast is interviewing people I might want to do something with, but that’s unspoken. 00:57:16 So I interviewed Alan Lee, who’s the founder of Exploding Kittens. Yeah. One of the most successful game development companies in the world. And I wanted to see if maybe kind of pulling from my childhood experience, I could create a game with him that would be easy to learn, hard to master, very, very fun for families, friends, whoever. Kind of goofy, but also ideally, and this is yet to be proven. So just to be clear, I’m actually hoping to do a study on this, but that could also possibly be a type of brain training and cognitive training. So I’m like, so 00:57:50 [Speaker Changed] You set the bar really low, right? Yeah. Just easy to learn. Yeah. Hard to master. Incredibly fun. Oh, with all sorts of cognitive benefits. 00:57:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So, 00:58:00 [Speaker Changed] You know, large, low target. Start, start slow with your first 00:58:02 [Speaker Changed] Game. Well, that’s why it took two years to land on something. Really. 00:58:06 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. That’s a long time to build what’s effectively a simple, I have a copy of this at home and you guys also sent me a copy here, so I want to open this up and go over it with, but give the listeners a quick explanation of exactly what this game is about. 00:58:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So the game Coyote, it’s called Coyote because of the sort of trickster, deity association and a lot of mythologies, also uniquely American Coyote or North American, I should say. It’s, it’s a, it’s very much a sort of new Americas animal, but the Trier piece is important. So Coyote is a game, you can think of it as rock paper, scissors in a group on steroids with many different hilarious movements and gestures. And basically you can play competitively where it’s last person standing wins or you can play as a team collaboratively. There are reasons that we had both options, but the basic gist is it’s a rhythmic game where you’re going around in a circle and you’re, each player’s dealing out cards that make a sequence of gestures harder and more confusing and more hilarious, and you each get three lives and last person standing in competitive mode wins. That’s it. So you can play, I have friends who’ve played with their, like 6-year-old daughters. Even though the box says 10 years old, it’s, it’s very challenging. When it gets challenging, I guess it’s 10 minutes a game, roughly, probably. Right. So pretty low lift, but if you wanna get good at it, you can play it over and over and over and over again. Every game’s gonna be totally different. 00:59:44 [Speaker Changed] One of the things I was kind of fascinated by watching the gameplay was it’s a combination of words and gestures that you have to recall and do an order while there’s the rhythmic noise going on at, at the same time that you’re creating. Tell us a little bit about how you guys came up with this and, and what was it like collaborating with Exploding kittens? 01:00:08 [Speaker Changed] We tried dozens of different prototypes before getting to this one, and we were kind of stuck because the question that I was asking myself was the wrong question. The question I was asking myself is, what types of board games or card games do I enjoy? And that didn’t get, I mean, your answers are only gonna be as good as your questions. Right. And that wasn’t working. We had done various brainstorming sprints and like La New York, long Island, and then flew to Canada to spend time with the co-founder exploiting kittens. And we did our last sprint. It was like, okay, look, we’ve been at this for a while. We’re either gonna land on something or let’s call, call it quits and just call a spade of spade. 01:00:48 [Speaker Changed] So a little pressure on at the end. 01:00:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, deadlines, you know, the magic of deadlines and expanded it to what games of any type have you enjoyed? And I, this might make me sound like a simple tin, but like having drinks and playing rock paper scissors with your dumb friends is I think very entertaining. Side note, especially if you try to do it with water in your mouth, try that with a friend. But 01:01:13 [Speaker Changed] What does water in your mouth affect? Rock, paper, 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] Scissors. When, when people laugh, they spit water all over themselves. So I, it makes it increasingly challenging, especially if people have had a few drinks, not recommending everybody drink. So we started with that as this building block. It’s like, okay, well how can we make that group play? And then I was interested in the cognitive stuff, as I mentioned, and this is, look, I haven’t proven this, but I I think it’s, it’s quite similar. You’re looking at like interference effects. There are things like the Wisconsin card sorting test, blah, blah, blah, and exploding kittens. They have an amazing track record. The whole company started with this game, exploding Kittens, which was I think the largest Kickstarter of all time. Wow. At that point in time, the leaders of the company are still game designers. So it’s not a huge bureaucratic thing run by no offense to middle managers. They’re important, but it’s like people who are managers versus makers, like the people who run the company are still some of the best in the world at creating games. Right. Elon Lee was involved with developing Xbox. He’s been involved with creating entirely new genres of games, just a genius at, at creating games. So it’s been a blast. Their team is awesome. They’re scrappy, you know, it’s relatively small. Like they really punch above their weight class. 01:02:30 [Speaker Changed] Still a startup, nimble able to, 01:02:32 [Speaker Changed] It feels, yeah. It feels like a startup. Like what they do with the number of people they have is just astonishing. It’s been awesome. 01:02:39 [Speaker Changed] I get a sense that because you’re such a thoughtful person, anytime you enter a new sphere, part of you sort of floats above your body and says, what’s going on in this space? Yeah, totally. I, I’ve had that experience in publishing. Yeah. Like, wait, I don’t understand the book industry. Why, why do they behave this way? So I have to ask you that question about the game industry. Sure. When you’re looking at, at gaming generally, what was your experience like going into not only an entirely new space that you haven’t worked in in the past, but like, did you kinda look at the game industry and say, Hey, this whole place is just wacky and so different from everything else? 01:03:26 [Speaker Changed] All of the above. And I, I treated doing something like the game as I treat the startups. So it’s, if I make no money on this, will the relationships developed and the skills and knowledge be something I would pay for? Right. Would I actually pay 01:03:41 [Speaker Changed] Tuition? 01:03:42 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. Would I pay tuition for what I’m going to learn? And the answer is yes. Right. Ilan Lee genius. The people like blinks amazing, by the way. You want a scrappy creative team. If you’re gonna deal with things like tariffs, by the way, are 01:03:55 [Speaker Changed] Are tar do tariffs, I mean, I’m sure assuming these are manufactured somewhere outside of the United States. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are, do you have to pay tariffs on 01:04:03 [Speaker Changed] Oh, every, every gaming company in the US pretty much tabletop game is getting smashed. Really? Yep. So you want people who are creative and can think outside the box. Hmm. For something like that, from the implications of something like that to contending with mass, mass retail, like Walmart and Target, for 01:04:21 [Speaker Changed] Instance. Yeah. You’re, you’re, you’re at Walmart, you’re at Target, you’re on Amazon. Yeah. These are challenging retailers to get shelf space, quote unquote from, oh, next 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] To how did that happen to next to Impossible. 01:04:32 [Speaker Changed] And yet you hit, that’s the whole, you hit for the, for the cycle. Walmart, target, yeah. Amazon. Where else is what’s 01:04:39 [Speaker Changed] Left? If I’m gonna do it, my, you know, my, this is my maybe one and only game, and if my name’s gonna be on it, I need to be very happy with it. And so 01:04:47 [Speaker Changed] How did you guys manage to penetrate that? 01:04:49 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’ll, I’ll say first that what’s not gonna work is if you are a sole inventor who comes up with the world’s greatest game, a company like a Walmart or Target is not equipped, rightly so, to deal with thousands of independent game designers who don’t understand retail, don’t understand margins, don’t understand supply chain management, don’t understand net payment terms and returns and all of these things. So if you want to have a seat at the table or even a chance to have a seat at the table, you need to, I think this is fair to say, partner with someone who already has shelf space and multiple SKUs so that you can be added to the lineup. And that was another reason to partner with someone like an exploiting kittens. And yes, you can do a lot online and the game is on Amazon. It’s been exclusive at Walmart for the first few months. 01:05:39 And then the social video plays, like you mentioned, went completely nuts. And it’s actually now past 300 million. So it just keeps going and going and going, wow. The, the videos of people playing this game. But you can do a lot that is, say, direct to consumer via an Amazon or just your website or Kickstarter. But it’s very easy for techies to underestimate just how incredibly powerful and widely distributed the Walmarts and Targets of the world are. Sure. I mean, 90% of the US is within 10 miles of one of those or 15 minutes. Wow. It’s, I mean, even the food security of the United States depends on these companies. 01:06:16 [Speaker Changed] And you price this at 9 99. Yeah, less than 10 bucks. Very reasonable. Yep. I’m gonna assume at if, if this game is as successful as you hope it will be. And early indications are that it, it can be, you could come up with a second pack, a different focus. 01:06:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Expansion packs something completely different. Maybe I try a more complicated, like role-playing game, something like that. Who knows. But in my case, right, with something like this, I’m used to kind of tiptoeing into things and testing the waters and 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] No, no, you’re jumping in z 01:06:50 [Speaker Changed] The jump band. I mean, even with say the four hour work week, it’s like, had I land on that title, I split tested all of the titles and subtitles on Google AdWords and then looked at the outlier that was many standard deviations away from the rest. And that was the four hour work week. So like that’s how I, huh. I don’t like taking risks. I actually think of myself as a risk mitigator, but in this case, 01:07:11 [Speaker Changed] I’m fascinated by that. ’cause Yeah, you very much strike me as someone who has embraced risk his whole career. Yeah. While rationalizing the potential downside. I don’t, I don’t wanna play pop psychologist, but, but you not somebody, it’s like, alright, I’m starting out as a studying biology. No, no. I’m pivoting to Asian studies. I’m living in Japan. I’m stopping what I’m doing to write a book. Oh, now I’m gonna pivot to startups. Yeah. That is not the life experience of a someone who’s risk averse. 01:07:45 [Speaker Changed] Well, I, I would on one hand agree with you. On the other hand, I would say I think that most risks are incredibly overblown. I would put agree, I would, I would put risks in quotation marks, and not to beat a dead horse, but if you’re choosing what you do, based on what you’re gonna learn, the skills you’re gonna develop, the relationships you’re gonna develop or deepen, it’s very hard to fail over time. So if, if you’re able to be, and this applies to investing, obviously, but like long-term greedy, right? 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] Not short-term, greedy. It’s very hard to lose over time. If you’re choosing, let me be very clear. Ideally, areas where you would pay tuition projects, where you would pay tuition for those things with relationships or skills that can transfer outside of that one project, which I’m always doing. And if you do that, like with Coyote, okay, let’s say, let’s just say hypothetically, I don’t think this is gonna happen. ’cause I, I think the tariffs are just a bargaining chip for mineral access. I hope you’re right. And other things that’ll be traded with 01:08:47 [Speaker Changed] China. That’s specific my thinking. I’m on the same page as you. Let’s hope that this is just a negotiating tack. 01:08:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean, otherwise we’re, we’re also like cutting off our nose to spite our face. Yes. I’m just so interdependent. So it’s, it’s, it’s a bargaining chip. I don’t expect that to continue. But let’s just say that tariffs put every game company in the US out of business, except for one or two. Then will this still have been worth my time? Absolutely. 100%. Because I have no, I’m not getting an advance for this. I’m doing a profit share. Right. I want, I want incentives to be fully, fully aligned. 01:09:21 [Speaker Changed] I, I did the same thing with my book. I don’t want an advance. I wanna see what our upside there is. Yeah. By the way, I really have to push back. This is just me. Maybe there’s a little push. 01:09:31 [Speaker Changed] I love it. 01:09:32 [Speaker Changed] Maybe there’s a little projection. You are not risk averse. You really aren’t. And I love the way you’ve rationalized or it’s not an excuse, it’s an explanation. It’s like 01:09:45 [Speaker Changed] Reframing it. Yeah. 01:09:46 [Speaker Changed] You, you’ve framed this into, well, I’m gonna take this risk, but I’m hedged because my downside is I get skills, I get knowledge, I get people and, and relationships. So the worst case scenario is all these good things happen. Yep. You are very much a risk embracer. 01:10:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and also if you look at my projects, it’s, it’s not a sequence of start, finish, start finish, start finish. It’s more like a Gantt chart where things are overlapping. So you look at this game, it’s like, yeah, I put a ton, I’ve been involved with every, every single possible aspect of this game. We play tested it with a hundred plus families, blah, blah, blah. But podcast is still going. The books are still producing royalties. Right. I still have angel investments and therefore I very rarely have all of my eggs in one basket. 01:10:35 [Speaker Changed] So two last questions on the game before we’ll get to our speed round. Yeah. First, this is obviously a low tech card game. Yep. Was this a purposeful decision to avoid screens to not create more screen time? Yeah, 01:10:52 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. I would say, if I look at the mental health of my audience, let’s just call it 20 million people a month or something over the last 10 years, the degree of like depression, anxiety, nihilism is shocking to see, especially in my audience, which is typically antithetical to those things. Right. Maybe not depression, but very optimistic. 01:11:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. There’s a little self-selection there. Hey, I have this issue, Tim seems to figure this out. Yeah. Let me work my way there. There 01:11:19 [Speaker Changed] There’s a little bit of that. But if you look at, let’s just say the writing of, you know, Derek Thompson made it amazing writer at The Atlantic who does a lot more, 01:11:27 [Speaker Changed] No longer at the Atlantic. Now he has his own substack. Yeah. 01:11:29 [Speaker Changed] Right. That’s right. He went full in on Substack. And actually this piece I think is from Substack, but it was effectively, I think it’s simply Americans need to have more fun. But it talk 01:11:39 [Speaker Changed] The decline of partying in America. That’s right. 01:11:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. That effectively, I think it’s something atrocious like one in 25 families or people have social plans in person for any given weekend and it’s down for certain. Is 01:11:54 [Speaker Changed] That right? Yeah. That’s 01:11:55 [Speaker Changed] Amazing. And it’s down for certain age brackets. 70% in the last 10 years. And I really feel like digital isn’t inherently bad, but the dose makes the poison. Yes. And, and I think that if digital excess is the problem, then analog is the antidote. I really feel like people need to interact with other humans. We’re not evolved for pure screen time. We are not. Period. 01:12:21 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. You’re a hundred percent. So last question on the game. Yeah. What are your expectations for this? How do you define success? And I’m gonna prevent you from saying I’ve already succeeded due to my collaboration, the whole experience I give you. Give you a experience on that. Hold that aside. Yeah. What’s your minimum expectations and what would surprise you? To the upside 01:12:40 [Speaker Changed] Minimum expectation is that this finds a small band of diehard lovers of the game. Everybody should read 1000 True Fans by Kevin Kelly. Just go to kk.org. It’s free. Read that. That would be super gratifying. But also, I always aim high. So I, I mean I want this to be the bestselling game at all of the major retailers. That’s incredibly hard to do, by the way. I mean 01:13:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s, that’s millions of units. 01:13:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean you’re dealing with tens of millions, the Unos and the behemoths of the space. Right? So to do that is incredibly hard. That’s what I’m aiming for. I think that the products, you know, the game can stand on its own two feet. Like people do love this game. And the reason I like to do that is not because I wanna set myself up for disappointment, but as I think it’s Larry Page of Google has said what people miss is it’s very hard to fail completely. If I aim for that and I’m 50% short, I’m still having had the excitement and the motivation and potential payoff of that huge goal, it’s still gonna exceed my expectations that I would’ve had 01:13:51 [Speaker Changed] A year or two. And just moving into a different space is its own rewards. ’cause it’s so, yeah. You know, it really exercises different parts of the brain than you normally get to, to play 01:14:00 [Speaker Changed] With. It’s, it’s also easy to pigeonhole yourself or get pigeonholed. Which is why after the success of the four Hour work week bought me permission to write more books. I didn’t do the three hour work week. I, I didn’t do the four hour work week for, you know, the sort of single mother soul or whatever. I didn’t do these line extensions ’cause I didn’t want to get pigeonholed as a business author. That’s why I did the Four Hour Body and everything on athletic performance because I wanted to be in a different category in the bookstore to see if my readers would follow me. And as soon as I proved to myself that was the case, and to publishers, well, you know, when I hit number one New York Times and blah blah blah, then I could write about whatever I wanted. And so this is another way of testing that, you know, could I play in a completely different sandbox. 01:14:44 [Speaker Changed] So before we get to our five favorite questions, I’ve pulled a few of your questions that either you ask on your pod or other people have asked you. And let’s do this as a speed round and see, lets do it. See 01:14:56 [Speaker Changed] How many it, I’ll try to keep my answer shorter. 01:14:58 [Speaker Changed] Right. Tell us about a hundred dollars or less purchase that has positively impact your life. Be specific. 01:15:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I will be specific. Now I’m gonna put in one shameless plug, which is, if people want to figure out this game, just go to coyote game.com. Okay. Back to our regular programming. Two things I would say that have impacted me in the last year would be, there’s something called the Alpha Ball, which is from Tuneup Fitness. And this is something you can use for soft tissue work, for a sore back, for dealing with your IT bands, anything. And it’s much better than a foam roller because you can really get into specific spots. It’s very easy to use. You can use it against a wall instead of laying on the floor. And it’s small enough to travel with. So I’d say the Alpha Ball is one, have that my luggage right now because I’m traveling. And then the other one is actually a meditation app called The Way. And it’s taught by someone named Henry Shukman. And it’s more or less a zen type of meditation. Full disclosure, I ended up becoming an advisor to these guys. ’cause I love, I ended up loving the app so much, but I use that once or twice a day. 10 minutes each session. And it’s teaching you sort of a 01:16:14 [Speaker Changed] Guided meditation, is that right? 01:16:16 [Speaker Changed] It’s a it, they’re guided meditations, but it’s a sequence of practical skills that you’re developing that you can apply outside of meditation, which is why I like it so much. So I’d say those are two that immediately come to mind. 01:16:29 [Speaker Changed] So you’ve spent your whole career delving into new areas, learning new skills and learning them quickly. What’s your favorite cheat code for that? 01:16:39 [Speaker Changed] Favorite cheat code is probably picking the skills in the first place. So what I mean by that is if you want to get the best golf coach in the world, you might not be able to afford it. You probably can’t afford it. It’s gonna be, it’s a very common sport. There are a lot of wealthy people involved. It’s gonna be hard to get direct instruction from somebody who’s top of the field. But if you choose, say almost anything, swimming, archery, whatever it might be. And you look for say, not gold medalists, but silver medalists. Right. Who are by the way, frequently just as good. They 01:17:17 [Speaker Changed] Just, right. It’s the 10th of a second. They, they 01:17:19 [Speaker Changed] Just, yeah. They just, they exactly. They just got 10 minutes less sleep than the other person that day. You can get some of the people who are best in the world to teach you at, at a cost that is next to nothing. So I would say that number one is picking, coming back to that definition that we talked about with the four hour work week with business and entrepreneurship, like picking the goal first. The second is looking at frequency of use. So for languages, for instance, a lot of people just dive into learning languages. Well I think that material beats method, in other words, like picking what you’re gonna learn very carefully is more important, at least in sequence than choosing how you’re gonna do it. A lot of people ask like, what’s the best way to learn X? And I’m like, first of all, you should ask what should I learn? And you can look at word frequency lists and things like that. And for a language like Spanish, Japanese, whatever, find the 1000 or 1500 most frequently used words. You can learn that in a few weeks. 01:18:15 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Duolingo du part of 01:18:17 [Speaker Changed] Your Duolingo is outstanding. I mean, of course I’m biased ’cause I invested in their first round. I, 01:18:21 [Speaker Changed] We just were in Paris three years ago, Amsterdam two years ago, Rome last year. And Duolingo, just for those basic phrases is amazing. 01:18:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s great. You can, I mean, I’ve used it for Korean as well to refresh my Korean, which I studied in school. Yeah. And 01:18:36 [Speaker Changed] That’s a tough language, right? 01:18:38 [Speaker Changed] It’s tough. The grammar’s almost identical to Japanese. So I’ve a leg up there. But by the way, like people, if there’s a cartoon, I think it’s like learning how to read Korean 15 minutes. There’s a comic book that literally will teach you how to read Korean. You won’t understand what the hell you’re reading, but you’ll be able to sound out phonetically Korean. And like, it’s a bit of an exaggeration. I’d say it probably takes an hour. But Duolingo is very well designed and I, I have seen every possible language startup. My fans sent me that one. By the way, my fans also recommended that I connect with Shopify ’cause they knew I I was interested in eCommerce. Huh. So a lot of my best deals have come from my, my readers and my, my listeners. But the Duolingo came about ’cause they were enclosed beta. And a number of my fans reached out and said, you have to try this really? And so I got access and I looked at it and I was like, oh yeah, this is fundamentally different from everything else I’ve seen. 01:19:31 [Speaker Changed] Give us an example of an unusual habit or just absurd thing that you love. 01:19:37 [Speaker Changed] I like repeating numbers. Could be the OCD. Go ahead. So I take a screenshot whenever I see five fifty five on my phone. So I have hundreds of screenshots of typically 5:55 PM I just love repeating those specific, repeating numbers. I a lot of folks like 1111, nothing against 1111. I think that’s, that’s perfectly fine. But I’m just more of a 5, 5, 5 guy. 01:19:59 [Speaker Changed] Those 11, 11 people, they don’t know what’s up. It’s all about, have you seen the old style analog almost neon tubes that are clocks? 01:20:10 [Speaker Changed] Yes, I 01:20:10 [Speaker Changed] Have. They like what happens when that rolls over to 1111? Do you see something like that? And just shrug and like 01:20:16 [Speaker Changed] 5, 5, 5. I still find it pleasant. I like symmetry. So 1111 has the advantage over 5, 5, 5 that it is pleasingly symmetrical. Like this old friend I used to have Mike Kim, his name is a palindrome. It’s the 01:20:32 [Speaker Changed] Same. Right? I was gonna say 5, 5, 5 is a palindrome, but it’s not truly symmetrical vis 01:20:36 [Speaker Changed] Visually. Exactly. Yeah. 01:20:38 [Speaker Changed] So, so there is, we were talking there a diversion earlier. One of the things I kind of was shocked to learn in the A DHD world is why people will play a song over and over and over again because it tickles a part of their brain that is relevant to certain emotional expressions that tend to be more difficult or absence. And it, it makes that like, oh, you’re getting that feedback that you, you haven’t been able to get in the real world. It sounds like the 5 5 5 and the 1111 tickles a similar part of the brain. Yeah, 01:21:16 [Speaker Changed] It could be. I think for me there’s just something soothing about repetition. I don’t know what it is. I mean, it’s why, you know, I mentioned archery, like I love archery and for most people 01:21:25 [Speaker Changed] Archery. 01:21:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I love archery and also language learning for most, for a lot of, there’s a lot of repetition involved. And for many people, and I think this is fair, they cannot imagine something more boring than going through conjugations or doing archery. Which by the way, if you’re doing it at a high level, you are effectively trying to do exactly the same thing over and over again. 01:21:51 [Speaker Changed] Isn’t that true for any particular athletic skill? I mean the variations multiply. You have basketball, you have five people on, on five people. Yeah. And so just extrapolate that out exponentially. And there are a million variations, the same with chess, whatever. But it really doesn’t matter. Each particular play move step is you’re trying to optimize that and do precisely what you need. Even something like darts. But there are so many variations to your musculature. Your, your thought process is any sport boring hitting a tennis ball? Yeah. I mean, it’s the same stroke over and over again. But there’s a bajillion variations of what can happen. 01:22:34 [Speaker Changed] That’s true. Which makes it interesting with archery, you’re standing in one place shooting at the same thing. Right. Thousands of times. Right. 01:22:42 [Speaker Changed] Any sharp shooting riflery darts, it’s go, go down the list’s 01:22:45 [Speaker Changed] Gonna be highly repetitive. Right Now I like the other sports too, like tennis. I would say that also confusingly, if people are interested in the accelerated learning stuff, the, the, my third book, the Four Hour Chef is basically a book on accelerated learning disguised as a cookbook. So it get, it gets into like how to learn, how to shoot three pointers, language learning, all this stuff. You can get a lot further. For instance, I think number one, adults can learn languages faster than children actually really 01:23:13 [Speaker Changed] With, if you, that, that is very an opposite to accepted wisdom. 01:23:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I I absolutely believe adults can learn languages more quickly than kids with a few constraints applied. And just a couple of systems. I mean, I, I really think for, for a native English speakers, for say a romance language or something that isn’t too far flung, like Chinese is gonna be different, but eight weeks you can be conversationally pretty fluent, like pretty functional if you were to carve out not three hours a week. That’s where kids have the advantage is that they’re forced to do it all the time. And they have no choice. They have no mortgage, they have no job. That’s right. But, but if you were to put in say, 10 hours a week and take it really seriously, eight to 12 weeks, you could be very functional. 01:24:02 [Speaker Changed] Very fluent. 01:24:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Like you could get around and have like a, a conversation for 10 to 15 minutes with someone. 01:24:08 [Speaker Changed] Wow. Let’s jump to our favorite five questions. We ask all of our guests. Starting really simple. What are you streaming these days? Give us your favorite Netflix, Amazon Prime or podcast. What, what’s keeping you entertained? 01:24:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, I just finished the last of us, which I thought was spectacularly well done. Especially as an adaptation from a video game. I am very interested in Korean animation because I saw a film on Netflix called Lost in Starlight, which absolutely blew my mind. Just the lost 01:24:40 [Speaker Changed] In Starlight. 01:24:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. The, the, the quality and the visual beauty of this animation made my head spin. Because you don’t, well I think most people do not associate South Korea with animation. You might think of Japan. 01:24:54 [Speaker Changed] Isn’t that where most of our low-cost animation is coming from over the past? Well that’s not CGI. 01:24:59 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s a lot of lower cost animation. Yes. But when you think of, say, cinematic right. Animation and Studio Gili out of Japan, let’s just say people tend to think of Disney, Pixar, studio Ojibwe. And I think Korea’s gonna be a powerhouse for high quality feature length animation. We’ll see, we, we shall see. But Lost in Starlight is a, is a recent fave. And then I’ve got some weird ones. Like there’s a German language documentary on fasting that I found on YouTube. You can’t watch it in the US but you can use A VPN to, 01:25:33 [Speaker Changed] I was gonna say you could watch anything anyway. Yeah. 01:25:35 [Speaker Changed] You can use, you can use A VPN to pretend like you’re in Germany and then you can watch it and just use the automatic 01:25:40 [Speaker Changed] Subtitle. What’s the name of that one? 01:25:42 [Speaker Changed] Oh, some long German name. I’m just getting started with it. So unfortunately I can’t remember. But it’s, it’s looking at specifically someone who did, I wanna say a two to three week supervised fast at the Wilhelmina Institute, who has fasted many, many, many thousands of people. I, I have some bones to pick with their approach, but I, I nonetheless find that they have such a huge data set, really fascinating. So I’m looking at that one. And then podcasts, I found a new podcast recently called STEM Talk, which features interviews with scientists mostly. And I’ve listened to an interview with someone named Kevin Tracy, T-R-A-C-E-Y, who is a very widely cited scientist who’s arguably the most credible researcher who has established a lot related to the vagus nerve and vagus nerve stimulation. Sure. There’s, there’s a lot of BS and pseudoscience and nonsense floating around. He is a real signal amongst the noise. So I’m listening to a bunch of STEM talk different scientists on STEM talk. Huh. And the, the interviewers are outstanding. It, 01:26:53 [Speaker Changed] It’s interesting you referenced YouTube because mostly starting in the pandemic, but just ramping up since then, I wanna say it’s become 50, 60% of my Yeah. Television viewing. It’s amazing how 01:27:07 [Speaker Changed] It’s also great for finding documentaries that you can’t find anywhere else. Right. So I think there’s a documentary. I, I’m the name is something like Learning How to See or The Art of Seeing, and it’s about David Hockney. 01:27:23 [Speaker Changed] Oh, 01:27:23 [Speaker Changed] Okay. 01:27:24 [Speaker Changed] Big fan. The 01:27:24 [Speaker Changed] Spectacular documentary. It’s grainy, but you can find it on YouTube. And I, I I was not able to find it anywhere else. 01:27:30 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Amazing. You mentioned one of your mentors earlier. Tell us about who your mentors were and how they helped shape your career. 01:27:39 [Speaker Changed] Early mentors Steven Gork. He was a martial arts instructor when I was probably 12, 13. Just from the perspective of physical and mental toughness. ’cause the class was all adults and then it was me. They did not take it easy on me. And I was very grateful for that. They weren’t abusive, but they treated me like an adult who was training for, for real. And I think from a toughness perspective, he, he always reiterated that I could do more than I thought I could do. Much like my wrestling coach in high school, John Buxton, who even to this day, many of his wrestlers have gone on to do amazing things and they all reference back to him then Ed Chao, who is that professor in high tech entrepreneurship in Princeton. There are other people who indirectly or pretty directly, although they wouldn’t have expected it informed later what I did. For instance, John McPhee, amazing, amazing nonfiction writer who staff writer for the New Yorker. He is got at least one Pulitzer Prize for coming into the country, I think. And he taught a class at Princeton’s seminar called The Literature Fact, which was on nonfiction writing. And I took 01:28:52 [Speaker Changed] The literature of fact, what a great name. 01:28:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And that class in terms of thinking about structure, how to structure writing, which by the way helps you structure your thinking. So all of my grades in my other classes went up when I took that class. It was no kidding. It was wild to see. Huh. And I’m sure there are many more. I mean, right after graduation, Mike Maples Jr. In terms of teaching me the ropes of Angel investing. That that’s 01:29:16 [Speaker Changed] A good, good starter list for 01:29:18 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s a pretty good roster. I was very lucky. Let’s 01:29:21 [Speaker Changed] Talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:29:25 [Speaker Changed] Some of my favorites would be Letters from a Stoic, which is by Marcus Seneca. Seneca in this case, meditation’s by Marcus as well. So letters from Stoic by Seneca for thriving in a high stress, high conflict world. I think that Stoicism, particularly as communicated by Seneca, is very, very, very present and applicable. And frankly fun to read too. Although that might sound odd. Applied to stoicism. So Letters from Stoic, I would say Vagabonding, a book by Rolfe Pots. I think the subtitle is The Uncommon Art of Long-Term World Travel, which is really, it’s a book on long-term travel, but it’s a book on, it’s a Phil philosophical treatise too. That’s a great fun read. Those are, those are two faves that come to mind. One More Awareness by Anthony Dello, I believe the subtitle is The Promises and Perils of Reality. It’s, it’s just about becoming more aware. So taking yourself out of the automatic loops that we all have and adopt from parents and so on. Really good book. It’s like 120 pages. And then in terms of what I’m reading right now, I just started a book called The Great Nerve, which is by Kevin Tracy, that scientist I mentioned. And it’s all about, on Vegas, it’s all about the vagus nerve research related to vagus nerve stimulation, et cetera. 01:30:56 [Speaker Changed] What’s the book that you’ve given most as a gift and why? 01:31:00 [Speaker Changed] The books I’ve given most as a gift includes some of the books that I mentioned. And if you, if someone were to stay at my guest bedroom in my house, I have shelves. Each shelf just has 15 copies of these books and I take one 01:31:14 [Speaker Changed] With you. 01:31:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, take, take, take whatever you like. So I would say that’s a great idea. I love that. It’s fun. It’s also very visually pleasing for someone like me. So the same, same, great. It’s very, very, very aesthetically pleasing. So Awareness by Anthony Dello for sure. I’ve gifted hundreds of copies of this book, letters from stoic, hundreds of copies of that book back in the day. Now there are a million copies, or I shouldn’t say a million copies now. There are a million different books on the subject of psychedelics and psychedelic history, psychedelic science, but How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollen. For a while I had that in my room because I got early galleys of that book and have since ended up doing a bunch of collaborations with, with Michael, who’s amazing. But otherwise, I also gift my friends who are nonfiction purists who are too busy to meditate, too busy to read fiction. 01:32:07 I tend to give them books of poetry because I’m like, you need to slow down and if you feel like you can’t meditate for 10 minutes a day, you need to meditate for an hour a day. That type of, that type of logic leads me to give them a very short collection of, for instance, there’s a, a new translation of Rumi poetry, relatively new called Gold by Hala. Liza GRI is her name, who’s incredible. She’s based in New York City and native, native speaker also who’s able to go to the source material. So gold, which is a new compilation of short roomy poetry that is well translated. Unlike a lot of versions you might find. It’s like a hundred pages. And I just say to my friend, I’m like, look, don’t read this A to Z, just read one before you go to bed every night. And those are probably the most gifted in the last handful of years. 01:33:05 [Speaker Changed] That, that sounds really interesting. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in fill in the blank, writing, podcasting, seed investing, game design. What would you tell them? 01:33:25 [Speaker Changed] If, if it’s nonfiction book writing, I would say, number one, are you really sure you want to do that? It’s not, it’s not, don’t assume it’s a good way to make money. ’cause generally it’s not. But I would say also, if it’s a recent grad, I would say if you’re gonna write nonfiction, probably go do something interesting before you try to write something interesting. That would be my advice. That’s what, you know, very fair. That’s what John McFee does. That’s what many folks have done. It’s like I get some life experience doing something first and then write about it would probably be my recommendation in the realm of investing finance, I would say that probably ensure you have an informational behavioral or network, meaning relationship advantage with whatever you choose to do. Unless you’re gonna do something like lowcost index funds, which I think actually are a great idea for a lot of people. And I, I myself also invest in very, very low cost index funds. 01:34:31 [Speaker Changed] That’s your core. You could build, you know, that’s your tree. You could throw some ornaments around it. 01:34:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, yeah, exactly. I wanna like keep your risk capital and your retirement capital separate. 01:34:42 [Speaker Changed] What do you know about the world today that would’ve been useful to know 25 years or so ago when you graduated? 01:34:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I’ll throw out a few. So the first would be from an investing perspective, you don’t need to compete in the public markets. Like you can learn a ton through being around startups or even very unsexy private sector stuff. And you can get very, very wealthy doing that. So you, you don’t have to compete against the citadels in the world. Like, I don’t wanna do that, or the rentech or whatever. Like, I like that’s bringing a knife to a gunfight. I don’t wanna deal with that. So I would say also 01:35:20 [Speaker Changed] Look for white space that you are, you can create your own area where you’re a pioneer. Not going into well trot space. Yeah, 01:35:30 [Speaker Changed] I would also say invest in what you know, and that sounds so trite, but the first, the first stock I ever bought was when I was in my teens and it was, I think it was in my teens, might have been a little bit later, but it was Pixar because I knew the world of animation. I was like, oh, this is so fundamentally different. Like this is gonna change everything. That’s it. That’s all I knew that. And so I, I would say that sort of investing from the perspective of watching main behavior on Main Street more than Wall Street is actually can be a really viable approach. And then in the world at large, I would say for me personally, 30 years ago, I would’ve said like your current experience of mental health and the buggy code that you inherited from your parents, God bless them. But like, you know, there are some bugs in the code is not a sort of psychological death sentence. Like you can actually change those things because you can, you really can impact those things and, 01:36:34 [Speaker Changed] And you’re living proof. 01:36:36 [Speaker Changed] I am living proof. And I would say that, you know, science, science is such an amazing tool, like the framework of science so necessary for not fooling ourselves. And within the world of medicine, especially psych, I don’t wanna throw psychiatry under the bus, but within the realm of medicine, I mean, anyone who’s worth their salt will say something along the lines of like, 50% of what we know is wrong. We just don’t know which 50%. And when I was growing up, I mean there were so many definitive statements about like, alright, you’re born with this number of neurons and when they die, they die. And that’s it. You can never regenerate these types of things. Totally false. And I feel like many of our assumptions about psychiatry, psychology, emotional health will be overturned in the next five years. It’s gonna happen fast. 01:37:27 [Speaker Changed] Thank you Tim, for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Tim Ferris, author, podcaster, angel investor.

Title: I'm Worried It Might Get Really Bad
URL: https://danielmiessler.com/blog/im-worried-it-might-get-bad
Time Published: 2025-08-11T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
I'm starting to worry things could get very bad, very soon. Not like in a year or two, but maybe in a few months. As in spontaneous recession type of thing. In the US mostly, but perhaps globally. It sounds irrational to me as well as I think it or type it. But I can't shake the feeling, so I want to try to write it all down to see how rational it looks on paper. In no real order, here are the various things I'm stressing about. These are people who've been making over $100-200K in tech or tech-adjacent for over a decade. And they can't find work. I mean they can barely get interviews. And when I say a ton, I mean multiple dozen that I either know or I'm one degree separated from. And again, these are not low-skill people. They're legit professionals that have never in their life had trouble finding or maintaining work. Google has said this. Amazon. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff explicitly stated the company won't hire any new software engineers in 2025, citing AI-driven productivity gains. We don't even really have to believe them, because we're seeing tons of actual layoffs at the same time. Microsoft laid off 15,000+ employees in 2025, about 7% of its workforce, explicitly tied to AI investments Intel cut 15,000 jobs, Tesla laid off 14,000, and Cisco cut 10,000 in 2024 It actually goes much further back, and it's no-doubt multi-causal. We had the pandemic. We had over-hiring. We've heard all the arguments for what it could be. Tech layoffs by year: 549 companies laid off more than 150,000 employees in 2024, and we're already at 69,672 layoffs in 2025 as of July 31st. The tech unemployment rate sits at 3.4%, but that doesn't capture the full picture of experienced professionals unable to find work. Hundreds or thousands of companies, and billions of dollars, are being spent on replacing human workers. Some don't think this is possible, but they think we need to invent some super smart model that's better than anything we've ever seen. We don't need that. What we need is scaffolding and piping that connects the dots and brings the right context together in the right way to solve problem x or y. This is not as difficult as it seems, and I already have a ton of the precursors of this working, and I'm just one person. Now imagine billions of dollars and tens of thousands of people working on it. Salesforce says AI bots now do 50% of the company's work. They're pushing what they call a "digital workforce" where AI agents handle customer service, sales, and even coding tasks. Microsoft reports that 30% of software coding work is already done by AI. These aren't future promises - this is happening right now. And the prize they're chasing is worth the cost, because it means saving millions upon millions in hiring costs, payroll, health insurance, and all manner of employee-related complications in every business everywhere. Getting rid of human work forces is a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity for the companies that get part of that pie. And they're spending on the R&D accordingly. There's a frequent counter-argument to the AI taking human jobs that goes something like this: Yeah, AI might be able to do the job at a basic level, but humans are dynamic and creative! We can use our innovation and brilliance to do things way better than AI! This is, of course, true. For some workers. Some of the time. But—by definition—most workers are not exceptional. Most workers, and most work days, are just drudgery. Answering emails. Writing up quarterly plans. Reviewing metrics. Building applications that do something with data. A very large number of people dread Monday, and that's not because they show up Monday morning and bring all their creativity and brilliance. It's because it's clocking in and clocking out on a job they'd rather not be doing. These are prime targets for AI replacement. And they are not the fringe. This isn't the bottom 5% of the workforce. This is the bottom 60-80%! In other words, my read is that the replacement of jobs by AI isn't coming for the bottom few percent. It's coming for all but the top few percent. Not all at once, of course, that will take years, but I think it's already started. Another thing I wonder about is I see how expensive everything is and I know what the average salary / working wage is. I can't help but wonder, how the hell are restaurants so full? How is it that people are still going to the movies, eating out, and buying stuff at all the different shops? I'm concerned the answer might be that many are just putting everything on credit cards. And the data points in that direction. We Americans now have $1.21 trillion in total credit card debt as of Q4 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That's up 57% from the pandemic low of $770 billion in early 2021. But what hits even harder is the average per household. The average American household now carries $10,668 in credit card debt, with average interest rates at 22.25% as of Q2 2025. That's over $2,300 per year just in interest payments. What's even more concerning is that approximately 9.1% of credit card balances have transitioned into delinquency over the last year. People are maxing out their cards and then struggling to make even minimum payments. Nearly half (46%) of American households are carrying credit card debt, and for many, it's becoming unsustainable. So yes, the restaurants are full and the shops are busy, but it's increasingly being funded by high-interest debt that people can't actually afford. Then we have the macro situation. I make decent money and every single day I'm like: How the fuck did I just pay $20 for a burger and a Diet Coke? And it's just everything. On a given day I might use a few different services, eat out a couple of times, and suddenly I've spent $100 when that would have been like $40 or $50 dollars a few years ago. Putting me aside, I look around at everyone around me and I'm like, how in the hell is anyone affording this? And every indication points to prices going even higher as a result of the tariffs. Economists predict tariffs will raise consumer prices by 2.3% in the short-run, equivalent to an average $3,800 loss per household. Morgan Stanley expects inflation to hit 2.5% in 2025, up from their previous forecast. Goldman Sachs projects core inflation could reach 3%. I just don't know how much more we can take before something snaps. And this is what I'm actually concerned about. It's not one of these things. Or two of them. Or ten. It's the fact that many of them are happening at the same time. It's the fact that they can affect and magnify each other and become something much bigger. These are the types of scenarios I'm worried about. Like I said, I don't think any one of these would be that bad. And I generally understand that it's hard to cause a recession just all of a sudden. Everything takes time, and there are natural balances to big movements in economic health. The problem is several of these are either likely or are already in progress. And that doesn't even include all the smaller compounding factors above. I think there are many things happening right now—or that could happen soon—that could combine to create a narrative of panic in a population that's just barely holding on. I just don't know what the country does if some significant percentage of our 100 million knowledge workers get laid off because of AI, which causes them to stop spending in the stores, canceling their services, which causes businesses to fail, which causes people to put even more on credit cards, which they can't pay back, which means people can't pay rent and mortgages, which might be someone else's income, etc... It's a cascade. I'm especially worried about the trigger being an extraordinary spike in knowledge worker unemployment in the next 2-18 months, which triggers evictions, worker Visa cancellations, foreclosures, a general blaming/targeting/fear of AI, which closes businesses, gets more people laid off, causes governments to overreact with legislation, etc. All of which culminates in a general nationwide panic. Again, not directly. The economy is quite resilient. I'm saying that these things can combine and multiply each other during a particular news cycle, or particular set of financial results, or job numbers, or whatever—which gets people talking on social media that turns into a narrative. Which will then cause a panic. And I think that leads to calls for one or more of the following: I'm not overly confident / worried that this will happen. It's just a really bad feeling. Maybe like 60%. Using the CIA levels for predictions, I'd put this one at: I hate not having a solution when I present problems, but I've talked about Human 3.0 and everything I recommend for becoming resilient / antifragile in a million other posts. I honestly think this is a bit beyond those if it happens and it's as big as I think it could be. You can't be too resilient (without a farm/bunker) if the basic society / economy is broken for a bit. My best advice right now is honestly—not trying to scare people—just to look around and appreciate what we/you have right now. Because if this happens, right now are the good ol' days. Let's hope I'm wrong, and that this pressure gets released some other way. Thanks to Sasa Zdjelar for talking through this with me. AIL 2 - Daniel wrote the post.

Title: 5 Job Titles That Will Disappear By 2030

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. By 2030, an alarming 50% of entry-level jobs could be eliminated due to AI gains, Anthropic CEO warned in May this year. And in my exclusive interview a couple weeks ago with Oliver Yonchev, investor and co-founder of Flight Agencies (alongside Steven Bartlett), he revealed: “The entry-level layer of jobs is going to disappear." What’s taking their place? The clock is ticking. Back in 2023, Goldman Sachs predicted that nearly one-fifth of all work tasks globally would be taken over by AI, with two-thirds of U.S. jobs exposed in some way or another to partial automation. Today, that figure shows no signs of decline. We now have: So the critical question is, Is your job at risk from AI? Artificial intelligence developments are accelerating at such a rapid rate that it’s hard to tell precisely what roles will be negatively impacted in the future. However, we can use estimates and reports from McKinsey & Company, the World Economic Forum, and Coursera to guide us and to make it easier to predict what job titles are most likely to disappear in the next few years. To know if your role is in danger of elimination, ask yourself the below questions and run this test: If your answer is yes to questions one, three, and four, and especially six, your role is likely at high risk of being taken over by AI at some point now or in the near future. If you answer yes to one or more of the other questions, you’re in a good position--even if your organization is preparing to implement and roll out AI, because your strategic role could be an integral factor in getting them to that position. The online learning giant Coursera released a list of five core job categories that are exposed to AI. These are: Many of these, especially in manufacturing, retail, and admin, shouldn’t really come as a surprise, because we started seeing innovation and automation in these fields for quite a number of years now (i.e., robots in production lines, self-service checkouts, chatbots used for customer service, etc.). Still, the effects can be painful, especially if you’ve worked most of your working life in these very fields. So what should you do if you discover that your job is not AI-proof? 1. First, identify roles within your industry that leverage your existing knowledge and experience, but allow you to pivot to AI-enabled functions. For example, if you work in sales, focus on relationship-building at a strategic level, for example, B2B sales and nurturing large customer accounts as a customer success manager, or account executive for a SaaS company, while using AI tools to support each part of the sales cycle. This utilizes human-centric and decision-making skills. (At this point, no one trusts AI to fully conduct the entire sales process, especially when companies are making major enterprise purchases as part of their agreed budgets, so you’re pretty safe here.) 2. Re-invent yourself for low-risk roles. The top low-risk roles include: 3. Focus on upskilling with the necessary AI skills. Learn about the most in-demand, high-paying AI skills here in my recent article, 17 AI Skills To Put On Your Resume In 2025. 4. Re-brand your career assets, especially your resume and LinkedIn profile, to highlight your AI skills, any AI certificates or courses completed, and adaptability. Don’t wait for the very role you’re in to crumble before you decide to make a move. Be proactive, identify your vulnerabilities and skills gap, and spend time each week spotting trends in your field, upskilling, and taking small steps to pivot so you’re ready for the change.

Stock futures are edging higher ahead of key inflation data due later this week; Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reportedly agreed to pay a portion of their revenues to the U.S. government in exchange for chip export licenses; Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is set to visit the White House after President Trump called for his resignation; and Bitcoin is rising near record levels, leading cryptocurrency-related stocks higher. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are pointing higher after the major market indexes posted gains last week, and ahead of inflation data and tech earnings due later this week. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.3% in the premarket after the blue chip index added 1.6% last week. Nasdaq futures are up 0.2% after the the tech-heavy index closed at a record high to finish last week. S&P 500 futures are little changed to higher in premarket trading. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note and oil futures are little changed. Gold futures are slightly lower after surging last week. Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are expected to give the U.S. government a 15% share of revenues from sales of certain chips sold in China in exchange for export licenses, the Financial Times reported. AMD said in its recent earnings report that restrictions on its China chip sales resulted in an $800 million hit. Nvidia is set to report its quarterly earnings later this month. AMD shares are about 2% lower in premarket trading, while Nvidia shares are down close to 1%. Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is set to visit the White House after Trump called for his resignation last week, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tan could use the visit to address concerns about his personal and professional background, while also communicating the importance of Intel’s manufacturing capabilities, the report said. Shares of Intel are up 2% in premarket trading. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is surging near all-time highs, rising more than 2.5% to trade above $121,100. Bitcoin’s record high was $123,218 set on July 14, when it jumped after the U.S. enacted legislation beneficial to the cryptocurrency industry. Shares of Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR) are up by more than 3% in premarket trading, while crypto brokerage Coinbase (COIN) and mining firms Mara Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are also higher. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world’s largest lithium producer, are jumping more than 10% in premarket trading as Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) suspends production at a major lithium mine. Bloomberg News reported that the stoppage could last three months and is due to a permitting issue. Lithium is used to make electric vehicle batteries, among other industrial uses. Chile-based Sociedad Quimica y Minera, or SQM (SQM), is seeing its shares rise by more than 8%. The mining delays come after another Chinese lithium miner suspended production in July.

Title: Is the A.I. Boom Turning Into an A.I. Bubble?

When Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chipmaker Nvidia, met with Donald Trump in the White House last week, he had reason to be cheerful. Most of Nvidia’s chips, which are widely used to train generative artificial-intelligence models, are manufactured in Asia. Earlier this year, it pledged to increase production in the United States, and on Wednesday Trump announced that chip companies that promise to build products in the United States would be exempt from some hefty new tariffs on semiconductors that his Administration is preparing to impose. The next day, Nvidia’s stock hit a new all-time high, and its market capitalization reached $4.4 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, which is also heavily involved in A.I. Welcome to the A.I. boom, or should I say the A.I. bubble? It has been more than a quarter of a century since the bursting of the great dot-com bubble, during which hundreds of unprofitable internet startups issued stock on the Nasdaq, and the share prices of many tech companies rose into the stratosphere. In March and April of 2000, tech stocks plummeted; subsequently many, but by no means all, of the internet startups went out of business. There has been some discussion on Wall Street in the past few months about whether the current surge in tech is following a similar trajectory. In a research paper entitled “25 Years On; Lessons from the Bursting of the Technology Bubble,” which was published in March, a team of investment analysts from Goldman Sachs argued that it wasn’t: “While enthusiasm for technology stocks has risen sharply in recent years, this has not represented a bubble because the price appreciation has been justified by strong profit fundamentals.” The analysts pointed to the earnings power of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, Nvidia’s revenues quintupled, and its after-tax profits rose more than tenfold. The Goldman paper also provided a salutary history lesson. Between 1995 and 2000, it pointed out, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose fivefold, and at the peak of the market a widely used valuation measure for the stocks that trade on it—the price-to-earnings ratio, or “P/E”—topped a hundred and fifty, a level not seen before or since then. By comparison, the five-year period from March, 2020, to March, 2025, had been relatively tame. It’s true, the Nasdaq had roughly doubled, and the P/E ratio had gone up considerably; but it hadn’t got anywhere near three figures. Having written extensively on the dot-com boom and bust, I found some of Goldman’s analysis persuasive. Many people have either forgotten, or are too young to remember, the extremes reached during the dot-com years. In the logic of speculative hysterias—from the seventeenth-century “tulipmania” in Holland to the rise of Pets.com—greed, FOMO, and the greater-fool theory of investing eventually combine to banish caution, common sense, and financial gravity. Back in March, there was plenty of FOMO and trend-following on Wall Street, but it hadn’t reached the levels of the late nineties. Five months on, however, echoes of the dot-com era are getting louder. Consider Palantir Technologies, whose A.I. software is used by the Pentagon, the C.I.A., and ICE, not to mention by many commercial companies. A couple of days before Huang visited the White House, Palantir released a positive earnings report. By the end of the week, according to the Yahoo Finance database, the market was valuing the company at more than six hundred times its earnings from the past twelve months, and at about a hundred and thirty times its sales in that same time span. Even during the late nineties, figures like these would have raised eyebrows. Eye-popping I.P.O.s, another feature of the dot-com era, are also making a comeback. At the end of July, Figma, a firm that makes software used by internet developers, and which has added A.I. features to its suite of products, issued stock on the New York Stock Exchange at thirty-three dollars a share. When trading started, the price jumped to eighty-five. It closed the day at $115.50—a two-hundred-and-fifty-per-cent gain on the offering price. Watching this market action, I was reminded of August 9, 1995, when Netscape, which made the Netscape Navigator web browser, went public. Its stock was priced at twenty-eight dollars, rose to seventy-five, and closed at $58.25. In percentage terms, this leap was smaller than the first-day rise in Figma’s stock, but it’s often described as the beginning of the dot-com bubble. It should be noted that, since Figma’s I.P.O., its stock has fallen back to below eighty dollars. This could be interpreted as a sign of sanity prevailing, but, given that the shares are still trading at more than double the offering price, other privately owned A.I. companies will be encouraged to enter the stock market. Renaissance Capital, a research firm that specializes in I.P.O.s, lists eight prominent candidates: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Databricks, SymphonyAI, Waymo, Scale AI, and Perplexity. Almost all of these companies are unicorns: they have been valued at more than a billion dollars in fund-raising deals with venture capitalists and other early investors. But, across the country, according to the research firm Tracxn, there are about seven thousand smaller and lesser-known A.I. companies, more than a thousand of which have already received Series A funding from external backers to finance their operations. The ready availability of early-stage funding means that a necessary condition for a dot-com-style bubble is in place. So are three more: excitement among investors about a pathbreaking technology—generative A.I. clearly has the potential to impact great swaths of the economy; a Wall Street production line staffed by investment bankers eager to earn fees for organizing I.P.O.s; and accommodative policy. Last month, the Trump Administration announced an “AI Action Plan,” which aims to remove barriers to the deployment of the new technology and to deter individual states from introducing “burdensome” regulatory A.I. laws. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, appears to be preparing to cut interest rates next month, which could give another boost to the markets. There are, however, some important differences between now and the nineties, one of which is that the online economy is no longer a vast open plain on which enterprising individuals can propose to build castles to the sky. It is a redoubt of monopoly capitalism, in which Big Tech dominates the horizon. During the dot-com era, or its early stages, anyway, small startups could reasonably hope to exploit first-mover advantage, gain early traction, and create durable business franchises. In the A.I. economy, it seems possible that many of the rewards will go to top firms that can afford to build and maintain large A.I. models and can use their market power and financial might to ward off, or buy out, potential competitors. A vigorous antitrust policy could perhaps prevent this from happening, but, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week, the Administration’s pledge to pursue such a policy is now under threat from lobbyists and power brokers with close ties to the President. If investors decide that monopolies are the future of the A.I.-driven economy, the outcome in the stock market could well mean further gains for existing industry giants rather than a broad-based bubble. All of this is uncertain, of course. The A.I. boom is still in the stage of building out infrastructure—training large language models, building data centers, and so on. A.I. applications are just beginning to diffuse throughout the economy, and nobody knows for sure just how transformative, and profitable, the technology will be. In this environment, many investors are following the time-honored gold-rush strategy of buying the shovel-makers and big mine owners. But history teaches us that even this strategy is far from risk-free. In an interesting analysis that was posted on the financial-news platform Seeking Alpha, an analyst identified as KCI Research compared Nvidia to Cisco Systems, one of the firms whose stock went parabolic in 1998-99. Just as Nvidia’s G.P.U.s (graphics-processing units) are now widely regarded as must-have components of A.I. infrastructure, Cisco’s routers and other network equipment were viewed as essential components of the internet build-out; for a time, demand for them seemed virtually unlimited. Like Nvidia, Cisco was an innovative and highly profitable company. But, in April of 2000, its stock dropped by almost forty per cent, and a year later it had fallen by about eighty per cent. A quarter of a century on, it still hasn’t recovered the high it hit in early 2000, although, lately, it has come close. The Nvidia-Cisco comparison was a useful reminder of a dictum from the pioneering stock analyst Benjamin Graham, who was a mentor to Warren Buffett: in the short run, the stock market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine that weighs the cash flows that companies generate. Ironically, the Nvidia-Cisco analogy also inadvertently demonstrated how long the short run can last for, and how dangerous it can be to predict its end date. The analysis was posted in February of last year. Since then, Nvidia’s stock price has risen by another hundred and fifty per cent. ♦

Title: Three Numbers That Prove Arista Is An Elite Tech Stock In Disguise

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks Inc. (NYSE: ANET) does not manufacture GPUs. It does not develop AI models. Additionally, it seldom attracts attention like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Nonetheless, Arista has quietly emerged as one of the most impactful technology firms in the market. Strong Q2 results and elevated guidance propelled the stock to all-time highs, climbing 20% in the last five days compared to a 1.7% increase for the S&P 500. Three significant figures illustrate why Arista ranks among the most profitable and resilient players in the industry. Seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks? The Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Separately, check out What’s Happening With Joby Stock? Arista achieved a 40.3% net margin in Q2—higher than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), or Microsoft. It also sells hardware. The catalyst is Arista’s cloud-native EOS (Extensible Operating System), which transforms conventional networking hardware into a software-defined platform. This leads to high margins and stable, recurring demand from hyperscalers such as Meta and Microsoft (accounting for over 40% of revenue). Over half of Arista’s revenue is converted into cash. Its 54% operating cash flow margin ranks among the top 5% of S&P 500 firms—including most SaaS companies. This cash supports innovation, growth, and a balance sheet that is already among the strongest in the tech industry. Having $8.1 billion in cash (56% of assets) and no debt allows Arista to invest during downturns, protect its market standing, and expand globally without needing external financing. This strength has been tested: Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. Arista is valued at 23.5x sales, 50.7x earnings, and 46.2x free cash flow—significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages. On paper, it appears more like a SaaS company than a conventional networking entity. The distinction lies in execution. With established demand from major cloud providers, software-like margins, and an expanding role in AI data centers, Arista is enhancing its position in a rapidly growing market. Arista is not widely acknowledged outside of technology circles, but its profitability, strong balance sheet, and role in AI infrastructure render it a pivotal player in the sector. The stock is not inexpensive, and hazards persist, yet its performance has consistently justified its valuation. For investors seeking opportunities beyond chips and AI models, Arista provides access to the infrastructure that supports AI’s expansion—and the market is beginning to recognize this. That being said, investing in a single stock carries risks. You might consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to maximizing profitable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Artificial workforce: Microsoft’s layoffs are a canary in the coal mine for white-collar jobs

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. In July, Microsoft announced it was laying off 9,000 employees, bringing the total job cuts this year to over 15,000. This isn’t a company in trouble. Quite the opposite: Microsoft just reported a quarterly net income of $27.2 billion, and its stock price has soared past $500 per share. So, why is it laying off thousands? The answer is chilling and profoundly important: Microsoft’s layoffs are not a sign of distress—they are a strategic reallocation of resources in response to a fundamental shift in how work gets done in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. These cuts are the canary in the coal mine—an early but unmistakable signal that the world of work, especially knowledge work, is about to be dramatically reshaped by AI. The implications are as important for tech leaders as they are for educators, entrepreneurs and policymakers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the layoffs as a difficult but necessary part of aligning the company’s workforce with its strategic priorities. Those priorities are now unmistakably centred on AI. Also Read: Layoff riddle: Why are companies getting worse at letting employees go? So far, Microsoft has invested over $80 billion in building its AI infrastructure. Tools like GitHub Copilot are now writing as much as 30% of its code. In other words, AI is already replacing work previously done by humans—starting with highly-skilled engineers. The jobs cuts, however, swept through gaming studios, legal teams, sales departments and even marketing. Several promising creative projects, such as the long-anticipated reboot of Perfect Dark, were quietly cancelled. Some affected studios were unionized, a sign that even organized workforces are not immune. This is not a temporary cost-cutting exercise. It is a strategic reshaping of the workforce. The new mantra inside Microsoft—“Intensity, clarity, and bold execution"—isn’t just motivational. It reflects a shift toward a leaner, faster and increasingly automated workforce. Microsoft’s central position in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure gives it an unmatched view of business sentiment and technology trends. When Microsoft cuts jobs, it often foreshadows broader shifts in the economy. In this case, the warning is stark: AI is not just a tool to augment jobs—it is replacing them outright. Also Read: AI didn’t take the job. It changed what the job is. Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce and many others have also made deep cuts, some citing AI directly. Even traditionally ‘safe’ white-collar roles are increasingly vulnerable. A recent report from Microsoft Research listed programmers, mathematicians, customer service agents, translators, researchers, writers, legal assistants and salespeople among the first in line for disruption. This challenges a popular myth—that only routine or low-end jobs are at risk. AI excels at generating code, writing and summarizing documents, and analysing large data-sets. And it is improving rapidly. Many tech CEOs like to downplay the coming tsunami with soothing ideas such as “AI won’t replace you—a person using AI will" and “every technology destroys some jobs but creates many others and AI is no different." These are simplistic and self-serving. Be very clear: in the medium and short terms, which are what matter for most of us, AI will likely have a devastating impact on a lot of white-collar jobs and wages. For countries like India, this poses both risks and transformative opportunities. On one hand, millions of our white-collar jobs in information technology (IT) services, business process outsourcing (BPO) and content creation are at risk. These sectors have been engines of upward mobility and economic growth. If we are not proactive, AI could erode much of this progress. On the other hand, AI has the potential to unlock new solutions in education, healthcare, agriculture and public services.

This isn’t a company in trouble. Quite the opposite: Microsoft just reported a quarterly net income of $27.2 billion, and its stock price has soared past $500 per share. So, why is it laying off thousands? The answer is chilling and profoundly important: Microsoft’s layoffs are not a sign of distress—they are a strategic reallocation of resources in response to a fundamental shift in how work gets done in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. These cuts are the canary in the coal mine—an early but unmistakable signal that the world of work, especially knowledge work, is about to be dramatically reshaped by AI. The implications are as important for tech leaders as they are for educators, entrepreneurs and policymakers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the layoffs as a difficult but necessary part of aligning the company’s workforce with its strategic priorities. Those priorities are now unmistakably centred on AI. Also Read: Layoff riddle: Why are companies getting worse at letting employees go? So far, Microsoft has invested over $80 billion in building its AI infrastructure. Tools like GitHub Copilot are now writing as much as 30% of its code. In other words, AI is already replacing work previously done by humans—starting with highly-skilled engineers. The jobs cuts, however, swept through gaming studios, legal teams, sales departments and even marketing. Several promising creative projects, such as the long-anticipated reboot of Perfect Dark, were quietly cancelled. Some affected studios were unionized, a sign that even organized workforces are not immune. This is not a temporary cost-cutting exercise. It is a strategic reshaping of the workforce. The new mantra inside Microsoft—“Intensity, clarity, and bold execution"—isn’t just motivational. It reflects a shift toward a leaner, faster and increasingly automated workforce. Microsoft’s central position in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure gives it an unmatched view of business sentiment and technology trends. When Microsoft cuts jobs, it often foreshadows broader shifts in the economy. In this case, the warning is stark: AI is not just a tool to augment jobs—it is replacing them outright. Also Read: AI didn’t take the job. It changed what the job is. Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce and many others have also made deep cuts, some citing AI directly. Even traditionally ‘safe’ white-collar roles are increasingly vulnerable. A recent report from Microsoft Research listed programmers, mathematicians, customer service agents, translators, researchers, writers, legal assistants and salespeople among the first in line for disruption. This challenges a popular myth—that only routine or low-end jobs are at risk. AI excels at generating code, writing and summarizing documents, and analysing large data-sets. And it is improving rapidly. Many tech CEOs like to downplay the coming tsunami with soothing ideas such as “AI won’t replace you—a person using AI will" and “every technology destroys some jobs but creates many others and AI is no different." These are simplistic and self-serving. Be very clear: in the medium and short terms, which are what matter for most of us, AI will likely have a devastating impact on a lot of white-collar jobs and wages. For countries like India, this poses both risks and transformative opportunities. On one hand, millions of our white-collar jobs in information technology (IT) services, business process outsourcing (BPO) and content creation are at risk. These sectors have been engines of upward mobility and economic growth. If we are not proactive, AI could erode much of this progress. On the other hand, AI has the potential to unlock new solutions in education, healthcare, agriculture and public services. It can dramatically increase productivity, personalize services and bridge gaps in human capacity. But only if we invest in the right infrastructure, skills and safety nets.

Title: The end of the mega-employer
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/americas-biggest-employers-facing-great-shrinking-corporations-ai-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-11T08:09:01Z

In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had a blunt message for his 350,000 corporate employees: There were going to be fewer of them in the near future, thanks to the "efficiency gains" he expected from AI. The proclamation generated big headlines and an uproar from staff. But it struck me as merely honest. He was acknowledging something that pretty much every CEO who sits atop a large white-collar workforce is quietly hoping to achieve sooner or later. After all, Jassy hasn't been the only executive to hint at a future of lower headcount. The head of JPMorgan's consumer and community business predicted in May that AI will reduce the number of employees in its operations division by 10%. That same month, the CEO of Klarna said that the company's investments in AI has already driven the company's headcount to shrink by 40%. And the CEO of Ford — a company that employs tens of thousands of white-collar professionals — declared that AI will wipe out "literally half" of all white-collar jobs. Meanwhile, Kian Katanforoosh, the CEO and founder of the software startup Workera, tells me that he never wants to have much more than the 80 or so employees he has today, no matter how successful his business ends up becoming. "I truly believe we can go super super far without growing more," he says. "I'm an engineer. I don't want to have to manage so many people if I don't need to." It's not like CEOs ever enjoyed shelling out for the salaries or navigating the personnel headaches that come with the sprawling bureaucracies they employ. But for more than a century, armies of office workers were a necessary cost of doing business. To grow from tiny upstarts into titans of industry, companies needed an ever-multiplying number of HR reps, accountants, marketers, engineers, analysts, and project managers. In recent months, that 100-year-trend is starting to come undone. Everywhere you look, AI appears to be helping leaner teams take on work that used to require more people. And executives are talking about their large workforces — once their greatest competitive advantage — as if they're an unfortunate holdover from a bygone, bloated era. If today's corporate giants shrink their ranks, and if tomorrow's giants never need to bulk up in the first place, we may well be witnessing the end of a defining feature of corporate America: the mega-employer. That could give rise to a whole new generation of nimble companies that innovate faster — but also leave workers navigating a world of diminished career paths and fewer jobs. Before the Industrial Revolution, most Americans worked for themselves as farmers or craftsmen. And those who didn't worked for very small operations — say, a few journeymen training under a master shoemaker. The resulting economy was a patchwork of all these tiny businesses. That started to change with the advent of capital-intensive industries like textile manufacturing, which required organizing larger groups of people under a single employer. Then came railroads in the late 19th century. With projects that took many years to realize and stretched over thousands of miles, vast numbers of workers needed to be on the same page. "If you mess it up, there's a big explosion," says Louis Hyman, a political economy historian at Johns Hopkins. "You needed to really coordinate your mechanisms and make sure that people are doing things exactly the same way." As mass production developed, Hyman says, many of the most consequential innovations during this time weren't so much technical breakthroughs: They were social inventions to coordinate the labor of all the people it took to get the most out of the new machines. The assembly line broke down complicated work into simple, repeatable, standardized tasks; scientific management emphasized the importance of monitoring, measuring, and optimizing everyone's performance; and the M-form corporate structure created a blueprint to manage sprawling bureaucracies through a clear chain of command. In the 1930s, about a tenth of the labor force worked for businesses that employed at least 10,000 people. By the end of World War II, that share had surged to about a third. By the 1970s, some of that bigger-is-better ideology started to change. A new management philosophy set in, normalizing layoffs that took aim at bloat. And as robots automated many blue-collar jobs, IBM mainframes and word processors eliminated a whole set of white-collar clerical roles as well. Still, there was plenty of work that technology couldn't automate, which meant that companies needed large teams of college-educated professionals to keep them going. Even the most tech-forward companies saw their people — especially their coders — as mission-critical to their success. "Hiring great people — especially engineers — is one of the biggest challenges that any technology company has," Mark Zuckerberg lamented in 2013. "Our country doesn't produce the volume of engineers that the companies would want to hire." Tech giants often hired more than they needed to make sure they had a steady supply of talent, and to attract and retain the best of the best, they treated their employees like gods. If you were to pinpoint one moment the gods turned mortal, it would probably be November 9, 2022 — the day Meta laid off more than 11,000 employees. From there, virtually every tech company followed suit, with employers across other industries close behind. At first, the cuts were chalked up to overhiring in the pandemic. But two and a half years later, the layoffs haven't stopped and hiring is still down. More and more, AI appears to be driving those austerity measures. In an industry that once hoarded talent like gold, the shift is striking. CEOs no longer seem to view the bulk of their workforce as indispensable, and they say as much: A common refrain among tech leaders from Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk to Dara Khosrowshahi now is some version of "If you don't like it here, you should leave." Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Salesforce had reliably increased their headcounts year after year. Now, according to the workforce analytics provider Live Data, all of them employ fewer people than they did at their 2022 peak. J. Scott Hamilton, Live Data's CEO, says this is probably just the beginning. To gauge how much deeper the cuts could go, his team recently analyzed the detailed responsibilities of most roles at Microsoft to estimate the share of tasks that could, in theory, be done by AI. Their conclusion: If Microsoft were to offload all of those automatable tasks to AI, it would eliminate 36% of the work currently done by employees. That would mean the company could lay off some 80,000 employees. On the one hand, that's an aggressive scenario: Companies are rarely able to overhaul their workflows to take full advantage of a new automation technology's capabilities. If they do, that transition takes a very long time. And besides, some work is simply too high-stakes to entrust to error-prone AI — even if it's technically possible. On the other, the estimate may prove conservative: Live Data's predictions assume that AI will remain at 2025-level capabilities. Given how much better the leading large language models have become over the last two years, the best tools will almost certainly be able to handle more than what they can today. "The optimists are saying that the good companies will simply redeploy the assets elsewhere now that they can be more efficient," Hamilton says. "But I think an equal argument can be made that they'll just say, 'We're going to do the same amount with fewer people.'" If that sounds like a far-off hypothetical future, consider what's already happening today at startups. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says he's making bets with his friends on when we'll get the first "one-person billion-dollar company." And Arthur Kaneko, a general partner at Coreline Ventures, tells me he's noticed that early-stage founders are raising their initial rounds of funding with fewer employees than they would have had in the past — among the AI-fluent founders, perhaps with less than half. "The way companies are being built is just fundamentally changing right now because of AI," Kaneko says. "Through the use of AI coding, AI marketing, AI sales, people are able to do a lot more work with way fewer people." And he thinks these startups will stay lean as they scale into successful businesses. "They just won't hire the people that Meta and Microsoft had to hire to get to where they are," he says. "I do think per-company headcount will permanently be depressed in startups." There are reasons to be hopeful about a new era of smaller employers. If AI makes it cheaper and easier to launch companies, we'll probably see more of them — and that would be great for the long-term health of the economy in all kinds of ways. New businesses tend to employ people with less experience and fewer credentials who get passed up by the bigger companies. They're more willing to try new things, which drives innovation. And they create more competition for the established giants, which is good for consumers. Smaller companies may also be good for the workers inside them. There's a lot that people hate about working at big organizations: the constant turf wars, the endless layers of approval, the meetings before the meetings, the sense that you're just one tiny inconsequential cog in a giant machine. Smaller bureaucracies would minimize that, which is one reason why people often feel more motivated in leaner workplaces. According to Gallup, employees at small companies report the highest engagement, with scores dropping below the national average once organizations hit 500 employees. On the same stage where Altman made his one-person unicorn prediction, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian raved about the benefits of this possibility. "CEOs and founders are going to be so excited to get up and go to work with much smaller, much more performant, much more culturally strong teams," he said. But a world of shrunken employers could also rob workers of something essential: the long-term career paths that big companies used to offer. With so many roles under one roof, big companies made it possible for workers to try new things, move up, and build careers. Smaller firms don't offer the same range of opportunities, which means people will likely need to switch companies a lot more in the future. Smaller firms are also less likely to invest in on-the-job training — a shift that would hit early-career professionals hard, just as their roles face the greatest risk from AI. The big question is what this all means for college-educated workers. If enough startups emerge, they might create new jobs to offset the ones disappearing from big companies. But that would require an unprecedented boom in entrepreneurship — one enormous enough to make up for the retrenchment of the giants. In 2022, 29% of the American workforce worked for an organization that employed at least 10,000 people. Meanwhile, the country's education system is churning out ever more college grads, who studied hard with the expectation of a stable future in white-collar work. If big companies hire less, and small companies also hire less, where will they all go? The usual reassurance is that AI, like every disruptive technology before it, will eventually create more jobs than it destroys. That glosses over an important detail, according to Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford. In the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, most innovations simply made existing work faster and cheaper — like the loom, which automated the work of skilled weavers but still produced more or less the same fabric. That made a handful of industrialists very rich, but for the average worker, wages barely budged for the first 80 or so years of industrialization. It was only later — with inventions like electricity and the automobile that gave rise to entirely novel industries — that economic growth surged and better, high-paying jobs emerged. Had that second wave never arrived, we'd remember the Industrial Revolution very differently. "Most productivity gains over the long run," Frey says, "come from doing new and previously inconceivable things." Right now, corporate America seems stuck in that first phase. So many executives are laser-focused on using AI to do the same work with fewer people, rather than applying it to problems we couldn't solve before — the kind of breakthroughs that would open up new lines of business and generate more demand for labor, not less. "A real risk is that we're getting leaner organizations, but they're not really creating that much new," Frey says. "That would be a bleak future, and I do worry we're moving in that direction."

Title: OpenAI to give employees ‘special’ million-dollar bonuses amid AI talent wars
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-employees-special-million-dollar-bonuses-ai-talent-wars-10182286/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T05:30:08Z

OpenAI has announced a ‘special one-time award’ to its AI researchers and engineers across several departments, including applied engineering, scaling, and safety. The bonuses were announced a day before the Microsoft-backed AI startup unveiled GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large language model (LLM). More than 1,000 OpenAI employees are eligible for the bonus, according to a report by The Verge. The ChatGPT-maker is currently valued at $300 billion. While the exact bonus amounts are not known, it will likely depend on the role and seniority of qualified employees, with the highest million-dollar payouts reportedly going to OpenAI’s prized AI researchers, who already draw salaries worth millions of dollars every year. The engineers, on the other hand, will reportedly receive bonuses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars on average, the report said. However, these bonuses are not likely to be paid out at once. Instead, it will be disbursed over the next two years with qualified workers having the option to receive the money in OpenAI stock, cash, or both. “As we mentioned a few weeks ago, we have been looking at comp for our technical teams given the movement in the market,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quoted as saying by The Verge. “We very much intend to keep increasing comp as we keep doing better and better as a company. But we wanted to be transparent about this one since it’s a new thing for us,” Altman added. This is reportedly the first time that OpenAI has offered bonuses to such a large number of employees, about one-third of the company’s full workforce. The move comes against the backdrop of a rapidly intensifying war for AI talent. Several companies have poached OpenAI researchers with lucrative offers, and Meta has led the charge. Since the one-time special bonus does not apply to all employees, OpenAI risks losing more workers, who may feel overlooked, to other companies. Mark Chen, OpenAI’s research officer, has previously likened Meta’s aggressive poaching spree to a home invasion. Shengjia Zhao, one of the creators of ChatGPT, was recently named as the chief scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Besides Meta, Elon Musk’s xAI has also reportedly been making aggressive offers to lure away OpenAI’s top talent. Thinking Machines, an AI rival lab started by ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, also comprises several of OpenAI’s technical staff. Meanwhile, OpenAI also reportedly plans to allow current and former employees to cash out with millions by selling their vested stock to investors. However, Altman has reportedly said that employees might be able to sell at a much higher share price than the current $274 per share at a higher valuation of $500 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg.

Courtesy of Ed Yardeni: Source: Yardeni as edited by Chinn. In terms of assessing how the general economy is responding to tariff and other uncertainty shocks, one might want to look at the SP500 excluding the Magnificent 7. As of August 8, SP500 market cap was $54.2 trillion; ex-Magnificent 7 was $36.7 trillion. Hence, the stock market is looking quite good partly because of the performance of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) stocks. The question is whether this outperformance is durable. One might say that the cyclically adjusted Price-Earnings (CAPE) ratio is not quite up to 2021M11 levels, so not to worry. I’ll just note that inflation expectations adjusted 10 year rates are now much higher: 2.1% in May vs. -1.0%.

NBER defined peak-to-trough recession dates shaded gray. Source: Shiller, Treasury via FRED, Philadelphia Fed, NBER and author’s calculations. Cape is as high in general to 2021. So yeah, its a problem. Margin debt is even higher. This seems concerning: “SCOOP: Trump’s team is considering longtime Bureau of Labor Statistics critic E.J.

More salient is how concentrated earnings have become.

Here they are: https://www.marketinout.com/chart/market.php?breadth=advance-decline-line Every market segment is currently showing no net advances in the past month, and a few of them are showing significant declines. In other words, the vast majority of companies have shown pedestrian earnings growth, and have had pedestrian stock price advances, if at all. I don’t think the advance-decline is a big problem yet. If memory serves, the A/D line had about a 50% decline from peak before the tech bubble popped in 2000. Very nice. A question: Having never given A/D analysis much thought until now, I’m curious whether a 50% decline ahead of one of the worst stock market declines in U.S. history amounts to a special case. Did it take an investing public too engaged in speculative buying to notice anything but their object of speculative buying to create that situation? Might we look for either a smaller decline in the A/D line to lead to a decline in overall equity market value in more common cases? While we’re at it, bullishness, as measured by a good many conventional bull/bear indicators, is high. Here’s the CNNMoney indicator, with components: https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed To NDd’s point about market breadth, the McClellan Volume Summation Index (a component of the CNN indicato), which is one method for comparing the number of gainers to losers, is neutral. I understand that portfolio cash levels are relatively low, despite a fairly good return to cash. Another contrarian indicator; not much fuel for additional gains.

Courtesy of Ed Yardeni: Source: Yardeni as edited by Chinn. In terms of assessing how the general economy is responding to tariff and other uncertainty shocks, one might want to look at the SP500 excluding the Magnificent 7. As of August 8, SP500 market cap was $54.2 trillion; ex-Magnificent 7 was $36.7 trillion. Hence, the stock market is looking quite good partly because of the performance of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) stocks. The question is whether this outperformance is durable. One might say that the cyclically adjusted Price-Earnings (CAPE) ratio is not quite up to 2021M11 levels, so not to worry.

Title: The Real Reason You Haven’t Been Replaced by AI Yet

Time Published: 2025-08-10T22:44:46Z

Itâs the ticking time bomb in the global economy, and every CEO knows it: AI is already powerful enough to replace millions of jobs. So why haven’t the mass layoffs begun? The answer has little to do with technology and everything to do with fear. Corporate leaders are quietly waiting to see who will be the first to pull the trigger. My discussions about Generative AI reveal a stark generational divide. Most people under 35 are convinced that AI is a reality, not a gimmick, and that the displacement of human workers is an urgent, present-day issue. For many over 35, the assessment is more cautious; they believe the replacement will happen, but not for another five or ten years. The problem is that the second group is several steps behind. The AI revolution isn’t being held back because the technology isn’t ready. It’s being held back for political reasons. CEOs are nervously looking at each other, waiting for someone else to make the first move and announce that they are eliminating a significant number of jobs because AI can do the work faster and cheaper. They are tiptoeing around what they already know. And they are telegraphing their intentions subliminally. Take Palantir’s CEO, Alex Karp. During an interview with CNBC in August, he said: âWeâre planning to grow our revenue â¦ while decreasing our number of people.â Karp then continued: âThis is a crazy, efficient revolution. The goal is to get 10x revenue and have 3,600 people. We have now 4,100.â The subtext is clear: Palantir already considers 500 of its employees to be a surplus that AI could replace. It could increase its revenue by 10x while reducing its workforce by almost 12.2%. Look at Amazon. The company has more than one million robots (Hercules, Pegasus, and Proteus, its fully autonomous robot) in its facilities and believes that AI will help increase its robot mobility by 10%. The number of its robots is nearly equivalent to the 1.546 million people (full-time and part-time) that the company employs globally. CEO Andy Jassy has already warned his workforce of what’s to come. âWe will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,â Jassy told employees in a memo last June. âItâs hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.â CEOs are waiting for political cover that isn’t coming. None of them want to become the poster child for the revolution that killed human jobs in America. They don’t want to become the target of politicians, knowing that on this issue, the attacks will come from both the populist left and the populist right. The problem is that politicians are just as unprepared as the over-35s. They seem to believe this is a problem for the next administration, a challenge for a few years down the road. They are wrong. The problem is here now. The questions are urgent: what will the displaced workers do? What safety nets need to be built? What happens to the healthcare of millions who are still a long way from retirement? These are questions politicians have not yet addressed, likely because they don’t have the answers. So, for now, the CEOs are buying them time. Instead of mass firings, a quieter trend has emerged: hiring freezes. Increasingly, managers are being forced to justify why a human is needed for a role that an AI could potentially perform. This is already devastating the job market for young people. According to Handshake, a career platform for Gen Z employees, job listings for entry-level corporate roles have declined 15% over the past year. And for those who still think the great displacement is far away, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported a few days ago that AI is already one of the top five factors contributing to job losses this year. Companies have announced over 806,000 private-sector job cuts since January, the highest number for that period since 2020. The tech industry is leading the charge. The machine is in motion. It’s not that AI can’t replace us, especially in knowledge jobs. It’s that your boss doesn’t yet have the courage to tell you they’re firing you for a robot. They don’t want to be the villain. Theyâre waiting for one of their peers to be crucified before they enter the stage. But for how long? CEOChatGPTlayoffsPolitics Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: Number Of Million-Dollar, One-Person Businesses Keeps Growing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2025/08/10/number-of-million-dollar-one-person-businesses-keeps-growing/
Time Published: 2025-08-10T20:30:23Z

ByElaine Pofeldt ByElaine Pofeldt, Senior Contributor. Sara Connell set a big goal for herself four years ago—to break $1 million in annual revenue at her business the Thought Leader Academy. A former advertising executive, she found that workplace stress was taking a toll, contributing to depression and an eating disorder. After spotting the the memoir, Holy Hunger, written by eating disorder survivor Margaret Bullitt-Jonas, in an airport bookstore. Reading it gave Connell inspiration to leave her job and heal. “Even if I end up on the street, I’m not going to do this anymore,” she told herself. That decision, back in 2000, paid off. Connell has broken the million-dollar mark at the Thought Leader Academy, based in Chicago, for the past four years. The Thought Leader Academy helps its clients build a platform in their industries by helping them develop their writing and speaking platforms with the help of writing coaches, mastermind sessions and group mentorship programs; it also holds live events such as the upcoming three-day conference in New York City. Called Women STARTING MOVEMENTS, it is for coaches, writers and visionaries who want to build seven-figure businesses while rallying others around their mission. Along the way, Connell, who holds a master of fine arts in writing from Northwestern University, has written seven books, the latest of which is The Download, where she guides thought leaders in using neuroscience techniques to tap their biggest ideas, and built a YouTube channel, Thought Leader Media, with more than 100,000 subscribers. Connell is part of a trend that keeps accelerating: the growth of million-dollar, one person businesses. The number of nonemployer businesses breaking $1 million grew to 117,060 in 2023, up from 116,803 in 2022, according to statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau. The number in 2022 more than doubled from 2021, when it was 57,822. Nonemployer businesses, as defined by the U.S. government, don’t run payroll. They are typically run by solopreneurs but sometimes by partnerships. Although they are staffed by the owners, these businesses do include contributions from other people. They get things done through hiring contractors, outsourcing to services such as Fulfilled by Amazon, automation and increasingly, AI. There are many factors contributing to the trend. A growing number of Americans are taking control of their careers at a time corporate life is increasingly harsh, a white-collar job shortage lingers, and fears of AI loom. They are building newly optimistic futures for themselves in self-employment as an alternative. Some are starting side hustles that blossom; others, like Connell, are leaping into full-time businesses that leverage the skills, knowledge and relationships they’ve been building all along, whether in their existing careers or other parts of their lives. Still others are pushed by layoffs to pursue long-dormant business ideas. To be sure, million-dollar, one-person businesses are still outliers when it comes to their revenue. There are 30,427,808 nonemployer businesses in the U.S., and the average revenue is $57,611. That is less than the U.S. average wage of $67,920, as tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, some of the businesses the Census Bureau tracks are part-time side hustles—not full-time pursuits that parallel full-time jobs. And million-dollar, one-person businesses are likely to continue multiplying, and learning from each other, as more people see they are a way to bypass a trend that keeps many from starting businesses: lack of access to capital. While building a startup often requires someone to have connections to private investors known as angels or venture capitalists, most one-person businesses are funded by the owners using scrappy, capital-efficient methods. If they scale up, it is usually through bootstrapping, or self-funding through cash-flow. Where the growth in million-dollar, one-person businesses is So how do you find your million-dollar opportunity? It helps to choose the right category of business in the first place--one where it’s possible for a solopreneur to get to $1 million. The largest group of million-dollar, one-person businesses is in retail niches, such as ecommerce, with $16,141 businesses at $1-2.49 million and 4,216 at $2.5 million to $4.99, the Census data shows. Closely following are professional services, with 16,654 businesses at $1 million to $2.49 million and 2,503 at $2.5 million to $4.99 million. Another hot category is wholesale, with 11,383 businesses at $1-2.49 million and 1,684 at $2.5-$4.99 million. It is also helpful to keep an eye on the categories that have had a significant growth trajectory in recent years. I have been writing about this trend since 2012, when it started taking off, and some categories have had more signficant increases than others since then. If you’re looking for an idea that will replace a traditional career, you’ll also want to keep an eye on sustainability. Some industries see cyclical booms. Examples are construction, an industry that currently has strong growth prospects, according to Deloitte, and mining, driven in part by the use of lithium in electric-car batteries. These types of industries are ideal if you like to jump quickly on economic trends when they’re hot but also accept there may be slow cycles, too. Other niches, such as professional services, have slowly and steadily offered opportunities to break $1 million in the past decade. Despite all of the warnings from business gurus not to “trade time for dollars,” some non-employer professional services firms in fields such as accounting are consistently breaking $1 million in revenue by offering valuable services to clients who keep coming back. Despite all of the ads on social media promising a way to make “passive income,” building a sustainable million-dollar, one-person business is often a multi-year effort with lots of experimentation. After leaving her advertising job, for instance, Connell took on freelance and part-time work while getting her coaching certification and starting a coaching practice in 2004. However, she says she struggled for years to earn a consistent income as a coach. “It was very difficult to put together a profitable business,” she says. Her breakthrough came when she had broken six-figure revenue as a coach in approximately 2016 and began shifting her focus--with the help of her own coaches-- from bringing in revenue to building her profits and cashflow. She also focused on her mindset, working on healing her own past trauma, using techniques such as tapping. “I have noticed a huge connection between trauma and earning, particularly for women,” she says. “I kept smacking up against an invisible ceiling until I did that work. That was the inflection point, that took us to a million dollars consistently and kept us growing." Introducing the Thought Leader Academy helped her bring the business to the $200,000 mark and beyond. This was one of her first significant shifts from offering one-on-one coaching to her clients to an academy model, focused on teaching clients in group settings. One particularly popular offering has been bootcamps, such as the Bestselling Book Bootcamp, designed to help clients determine what they will write and outline their books. On the recommendation of one of her coaches, she gave each bootcamp a theme, such as “writing a transformational book. She rolls out downloadable content that supports the bootcamps over the eight weeks beforehand to build community around the ideas. “We did eight weeks of sharing about ‘What’s the difference? Why might one want to focus on transformation versus information?’" she explains. “It created interest and curiosity and also differentiated this bootcamp from another one.” Public speaking helps her attract her ideal customers. “We went to $1 million with no ads, no social media,” she says. Today, her YouTube channel also helps attracts like-minded clients. She surveys her ideal customers before rolling out new offerings to make sure there is interest in purchasing them before fully developing an idea. Connell initially did most of the work of the business herself, but realized that to scale her revenue and profits, she needed to build a virtual team to support her. Today, she relies on six service providers: contracted writing coaches and vendors such as graphic designers, a virtual assistant and an automation contractor to extend what she can do individually. “We have wonderful people I consider part of my team, but they’re not a team from an employee standpoint,” she says. As for the future, Connell plans to keep growing the business, with an eye toward bringing clients a fresh take on what’s happening in the market. “It really lights me up to think about what’s happening in the world, and what’s happening in the marketplace, and to help someone figure out their book’s focus and how it will be positioned,” she says. Meanwhile, she’s on the front lines of defining what it means to run a million-dollar, one-person business, a phenomenon that it likely to evolve considerably as artificial intelligence (AI) makes it easier than ever before for solopreneurs to get more done with fewer resources and to combine their own intelligence with that of machines. “I want to be part of this age of AI,” she says.

August 10, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Chairman and CEO Abel Avellan said, "Our revolutionary satellites and proprietary ASICs were designed with S-Band capabilities in mind. With these new spectrum priority rights, we will be in a position to bring services in S-Band to targeted markets around the world." He added that, combined with the company's existing global 3GPP spectrum holdings and planned L-Band strategy in the U.S. and Canada, the rights would allow expansion of subscriber capacity, enabling most countries to access the full AST SpaceMobile network with speeds targeted at up to 120 Mbps. The agreement, signed August 5, 2025, covers rights to MSS frequencies from 1980-2010 MHz and 2170-2200 MHz for use in low Earth orbit. These bands will be deployed globally subject to regulatory approval, complementing AST SpaceMobile's core cellular spectrum approach. The $64.5 million deal will be paid in cash or stock at the company's discretion, with $26 million due at closing and $38.5 million deferred, partly tied to performance milestones. Closing is expected in the second half of 2025, pending customary conditions. UBS Securities LLC is serving as financial advisor, with McGuireWoods LLP providing legal counsel.

My brand-new card game with Exploding Kittens is now a national bestseller! Learn more. by Tim Ferriss Leave a comment Please enjoy this transcript of my conversation with Elan Lee, cofounder of Exploding Kittens. This is a very special episode for me, one I’ve been looking forward to publishing for months. It features a behind-the-scenes look at my latest creative project, my new game COYOTE. COYOTE is a fast, casual card game I created with Elan and the Exploding Kittens team. It has been my obsession for two years. I worked really hard on every aspect of this one (concept, mechanics, art, you name it)! You can finally buy it everywhere, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and 8,000+ retail locations worldwide. It’s been a hit with 100+ test families, my friends, and at conferences around the world. It now produces guaranteed laughs with kids, adults, tipsy people, serious people… all who enjoy unleashing their inner trickster. If you’ve benefited from my podcast, newsletter, books, or anything at all, please grab a copy or two! It only costs $10-12 and can provide hours upon hours of fun. It takes minutes to learn and 10 minutes to play. Under the hood, it’s also designed to be a good workout for your brain. If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to get a product on the shelves of something like Walmart or Target, or simply create a game, this podcast covers it all. P.S. One last thing: read to the end for a very fun surprise that involves a mystery Hollywood party.

This is another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. I’m Tim Ferriss and I’m sitting with a friend of mine who I brought to my podcast with a secret agenda that has ended up two years later with a very, very not-so-secret-for-long outcome that we’re going to talk about, Elan Lee. Elan Lee: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: Nice to see you again. Elan Lee: It’s nice to see you too. That was a secret agenda. That was a two-year-in-the-making secret agenda. Tim Ferriss: Two years in the making. So what we’re going to do in this conversation, and I just hijacked his bio because I’ve had too much caffeine, so I’m going to let him do the self-intro in a second. But we’re going to give you a peek behind the curtain, under the hood, open the kimono, choose your metaphor. We’re going to talk about the creative process, the development process, thinking about distribution, retail, all of these things which I have not heard discussed anywhere else in depth. Elan Lee: You buried the lead. All of that stuff of — Tim Ferriss: Of a game that we created that from the very beginning was something I’ve wanted to do my whole life, which is create a game. I was raised, protected in some ways by Dungeons & Dragons as a kid. It was my refuge from bullying and also just the straight boredom of most of my schooling at the time. And that immersive experience, the ability to get lost in a world of imagination and fun and laughter and emotion was so incredibly important. It was so formative for me that the seed was planted really early. And I think you know this because I probably sent you a photograph of this at one point. I still have all of my modules. I have The Player’s Handbook, First Edition, Dungeon Master’s Guide, all of the dice, everything from when I was a kid. I’ve kept it to this day. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. But hold on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: If you’re not going to say it, I’m going to say it. Tim Ferriss made a game. Tim Ferriss: I did. Elan Lee: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It took me 47 years, but here we are. So the game, I’ll just show it to camera for people who want a visual who are not watching this. If you’re listening, you can go to tim.blog/coyote. So I’m giving a bit of what you might call foreshadowing in the biz. But this is the game. It is a card game. It’s called Coyote. That name did not come easily. We went through about 537 different names and lots of testing and we’ll talk about some of that. But this is the game and it’s effectively, I’d like to hear your pitch because we have slightly different approaches, but I would say it is rock-paper-scissors on steroids. So there are God knows how many, maybe 20 different gestures, something like that, 66 total cards. And you can play cooperatively where you’re all trying to beat the game together or competitively where you can sabotage individual players, throw curveballs of all different types, and that relates to the name Coyote, if you think about the trickster mythology associated with Coyote. Elan Lee: Yeah Tim Ferriss: We never got to your bio. Who the hell are you? Elan Lee: Oh, that’s the least interesting part of this whole thing. Tim Ferriss: No, I know, but it puts it in perspective and just explain the company a bit, the scope of it, et cetera Elan Lee: I love talking about games, I hate talking about myself. So I will try. Tim Ferriss: That’s why it takes someone like me to force you to do it. Elan Lee: Yeah. Okay, here we go. My name is Elan Lee. I am the co-creator and CEO of Exploding Kittens. I believe we’re the number one independent game studio in the world, something like that. I don’t know. We’ve sold a whole bunch of games. We’ve sold 60 million games at this point and been running that company for 10 years now. And before that I was the chief design officer at the Xbox and before that I worked at a pet store. Tim Ferriss: And for people who want the full journey, including the sort of magical tinderbox that was Kickstarter way back in the day, how this whole adventure started 10 plus years ago, listen to the first conversation that I did with Elan. I had wanted to make a game and quickly realized that an RPG, something like Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, was going to be too complicated for me and my friends as adults to play. It would be too hard for me to recruit my friends where you have, let’s just say, a full day, then you have dinner, maybe you have a few drinks, and then you have an hour before people split. There’s no way I’m going to get someone to build, for instance, a chaotic good gray elf, which was my orientation, and work from there. It’s just not going to happen. And meanwhile, about maybe it was a year or two years before I invited you on the podcast, I found this game Poetry for Neanderthals and holy shit, had so much fun with that with my friends. I thought, “Okay, I think I want to tilt my game dreams,” which at that point had no real direction, “towards something more casual.” But in the meantime, I’d also been listening to all sorts of podcasts and so on that we’ll get to. But you’ve explained your background. Elan Lee: Well, hold on. So what you just described is exactly why I started Exploding Kittens, because I also — okay, a little bit different. Unlike you, I, when I encounter those crazy two and four and six-hour games, I am immediately turned off. I can’t focus for that long. I can’t understand the rules. If it takes longer than five minutes to explain a game, I am gone. I have no ability to play that game. And so the whole reason I started this company, and I think the whole reason that you made the pivot from giant role-playing games to being interested in the creation of casual fast-party games is this golden rule of two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play because nothing’s at stake there, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: You’re going to learn it. You’re either going to love the game or you’re going to hate it, but whatever, you committed five minutes total to that thing. And I love the games where after the five-minute commitment, you’re still going to play for two hours. But they’re going to be in these little five-minute sessions over and over and over again. And it sounds like that’s the experience you had, which makes me so happy because that means mission accomplished. That’s exactly what I wanted to build. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to talk about different rules or tenets that you have because what I want to do in this conversation, we’re definitely going to talk about the process of building this game because I am really, really happy with it and really proud. Elan Lee: It’s so good. You should be. It’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And we’ll have a lot to talk about. But the motivation also of basically showing the cards, I’m going to use so many mixed metaphors here, is to teach people game design and explain why this has possessed such a toehold in my mind for so long. Elan Lee: Yeah. Well, you went through a journey and I’m excited looking at that journey through your eyes of, “I don’t even know what I want to build, but I know I want to build a fun experience that I would enjoy, that my friends would enjoy,” all the way through to this thing is at every Walmart and Target in North America. That journey is incredible and you got to see it for the first time. You absolutely drank from the firehose here. This was fun for me because I had to walk you through this, right? You’ve never sold a game before. So walking through the process of how you make a game and how you sell a game, it doesn’t work the way people think. So retailers have a buyer per category. So if anybody wants to sell something to a retailer, you want something in Target or Walmart or Amazon or Barnes & Noble. The way it works is you have to convince the buyer for your category to take your thing, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They have limited shelf space. It’s very precious real estate. So you have to convince them that your thing is better than anybody else’s thing. And twice a year they have these things called line reviews.The buyers have to buy games for next year, right? They need to put stuff on the shelf. There’s only a certain number of meetings they can physically have in a period of time because it’s usually one or two or maybe three people. So they take as many meetings as they can. It’s usually a dozen, maybe two dozen. And in those meetings — Tim Ferriss: In your case, with different game manufacturers, different studios. Elan Lee: Exactly. So they’ll take a meeting with Hasbro and they’ll take a meeting with Mattel and all the big guys. And in those meetings, 20, 30, 50 games are pitched to them in every single one of those meetings. And then they’ll make a decision on which ones they’re going to purchase and stock for the next year. So that’s line review. The tricky parts for line review is one, you got to do a great job, but even before that, you got to get that meeting, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They only have time for a certain number of meetings. So you have to put yourself in a position where you can get in that room. Tim Ferriss: All right, so we’re going to talk strategy and tactics for line review in a minute because, and take this as a compliment, you are one of the best in-person salespeople I’ve ever seen. Elan Lee: That could also be an insult, but I’ll take it, I’ll take it. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s not an insult. No, no, it’s not an insult. Everybody’s in sales, whether they like to admit it or not, whether you’re selling ideas, you’re selling a position, a perspective, if you want to call it deal making. This is what I used to say in my class, my guest lecture that I taught for 10 years, once or twice a year in high-tech entrepreneurship. I would start off by saying, “Who here wants to be in sales?” No hands would go up and I would say, “Well, I’ve got some good news and I’ve got some bad news. Bad news is you’re all in sales. And let me explain why. If you want to call it deal making, fine, you’re going to have to negotiate. You don’t get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate.” Elan Lee: That’s well said. Tim Ferriss: “And you get what you can present in a very persuasive way.” I was like, “The good news is you can learn it.” Elan Lee: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: This is a coachable, learnable skill, which I completely still believe. There’s some people who may have a little bit of extraversion, charismatic reality, distortion, field advantage, but you can become excellent even if you start with zero raw materials. Okay, so the journey, wanted to make a game my whole life, but it was this vague, “Maybe someday. God, wouldn’t it be nice?” Elan Lee: Let me just poke at that for a second. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sure. Elan Lee: Why? Tim Ferriss: The why is I wanted to imbue someone else’s experience with the magic I felt playing D&D. Elan Lee: Well said. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Or much easier games, right? It’s such a simple game. I used to play Sorry and Monopoly. And as a young kid, I just thought Sorry was the most hilarious thing when you could look someone in the eyes and go, “Sorry,” and knock their stuff off the board. I didn’t always respond well when it happened to me. It doesn’t have to be the incredibly immersive, complex game that D&D is, although I still think that is just like Gary Gygax and the team way back in the day, holy cow. Also, by the way, for people who don’t know, Gen Con, huge convention, started out around Lake Geneva and was, I believe, created by the TSR guys way back in the day. Elan Lee: I believe that’s right. Yeah. Yeah, Gen Con from Lake Geneva and then was the Generals Convention, and now is nothing. Now Gen Con doesn’t stand for anything because it’s in Indianapolis. But anyway, sorry. It was an aside. Tim Ferriss: It’s an aside. So that was the kind of impetus behind wanting to make a game, but it didn’t have any form. And then I suppose it was maybe two and a half, three years ago, I was like, “Okay, I’d like to actually take a deeper dive here.” Because there are lots of things we have on our, say, list of New Year’s resolutions. For instance, for a long time I had “Develop the side splits like Jean-Claude Van Damme.” Never happened, but it was there every fucking year and it just got punted. I was like, “Well, didn’t do it. Okay, this year is the year.” But there was no plan, there were no deadlines, there were no constraints, which is the power of constraints, which we’ll probably talk about. Elan Lee: Absolutely, yes. Tim Ferriss: It is so critical. It’s not just critical. It is additive to have constraints, which seems like a contradiction, but it’s not. Well, we’ll, I’m sure, get to that. So I started looking at different options and the catalyst for this actually was something way back in the day, some of you will remember called The Legend of CØCKPUNCH, and that was an NFT project — remember those? Which raised two million bucks for fundamental science and mechanistic studies basically related to mental health. So all the proceeds from that, if you want to look it up, it’s easy to find Legend of CØCKPUNCH. But all the proceeds went to a nonprofit foundation, which then funds mental health, therapeutic research and things related to that. But in the process of doing that, I got to, with very low stakes because I think it’s helpful when possible, especially if you’re an intrepid beginner wading into unfamiliar creative waters, make the stakes super, super low, right? And even before this podcast, it’s like, “Okay, this is a very unusual conversation where it’s like, “Look, we’re not doing this live. If we really don’t like it, we can scrap the whole thing.” So reduce, reduce, reduce the pressure and the stakes until you can get started, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: With writing, I got the advice long ago, two crappy pages per day. That’s it. Elan Lee: Love it. Tim Ferriss: And then you actually put pen to paper. Elan Lee: Yeah, the overlaps are enormous with games. But, yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Super related. Also the iterative process. All right, so using The Legend of CØCKPUNCH as this pretext, basically I started writing fiction and so I wrote these very, very, it turned out to be very involved, very viable fantasy histories and pieces, tying all of these greater houses together and then having these protagonists, the father and then the son, who’s Tyrolean, and yada, yada, yada, yada. And I still think there might be something there, but in the process of creating that, I thought to myself, “This would actually make a fantastic game. And it wouldn’t have to be as complicated as D&D, but you would have allies, you would have age old amenities, would have different strengths, certain strengths that cancel out other strengths, weaknesses that can be taken advantage of.” And that led me to start listening to a podcast called Think Like a Game Designer with Justin Gary, which is outstanding. I recommend people check it out. And a lot of the focus there, not entirely, but a lot of the focus there was on trading card games, alternately called collectible card games, I guess. Wizards of the Coast who created Magic: The Gathering, patented and trademarked one of them. So they seem to be used interchangeably. But Justin, also former high-level competitive Magic: The Gathering player, has a lot of knowledge around that world. He’s developed some incredibly successful games in that genre where you’re building a deck, you’re buying certain cards or decks with the hopes of getting certain cards and assembling your toolkit basically. And that was initially where my mind went in terms of game concept. But I realized a few things really quickly. I was a D&D guy, which predated Magic: The Gathering. My brother was a Magic: The Gathering guy. But I’ve never really played Magic. And when I began to delve into it, I was like, “You know what? I would like to think of this as D&D light, but this is incredibly nuanced.” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: To be good at this — Elan Lee: Oh, for sure, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — it is incredibly nuanced. And also if you’re against someone who is really experienced or just has their mind wired for it, you are going to be obliterated. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And that’s what happened to me playing a friend of mine, kudos to Mike, just got slayed. And God bless Mike, he’s like a number of my friends who just kind of want to watch you die slowly in this agonizing ill-fated gameplay where you’re kind of whimpering along until they put you out of your misery. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, you play a card, he said, “Isn’t this cute? You think you’ve got it. Watch this.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is just not really my thing. So I thought to myself, okay, looking at some of the casual games I really like, there is an opportunity, and this will come back later, for the underdog or the person who is behind to win. So there’s an element, it is skill-based, but there’s an element of chance and this is going to come back. So then Poetry for Neanderthals, I don’t know how I found it initially, frankly. I think I probably went into a game shop and I was like, “Hey,” and this relates to why, as an adult, I want to spend less time in front of screens and ultimately if I look back and do this thing every year called a past year review, people can find it online, you can read all about it and do it yourself. You don’t have to buy anything, past year review. Where I look at the peak positive and negative emotional experiences of the past year, I go through my whole calendar. Sometimes I’ll go through my photos, sometimes I’ll go through my text messages or my sent folder in the inbox. And lo and behold, and this is not a revelation for some people, but the activities did not matter as much as the people. So then the question is, how do I create different contexts for interacting with, let’s just say, my 10 or 15 closest friends? Some of that is doing things outside in the wilderness that are active and so on. But that’s a heavy lift, that’s a heavier lift than — Elan Lee: A high barrier of entry. Tim Ferriss: — playing a casual game, right? So it’s like if I’m here in Austin, where we are right now, and my friends or a bunch of my friends come in for South by Southwest and I manage to get them together for one night, what can we play that will get us off of our goddamn phones and deepen our relationship and create memories that we can hold onto that will stick around? That’s it. That’s it, right? Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: And then we had our conversation and that’s kind of when everything, I guess, kicked off. Just a couple of things maybe that we should mention also. After our conversation when, I think, very shyly I must have reached out to you at some point shortly thereafter, and I was kind of like, “Hey, guy, not sure if this would be interesting, but maybe kind of sort, do you want to talk about maybe making a game together or something?” Elan Lee: I remember this exact conversation. It’s like asking me out on a first date. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like scratching my head looking at the ground. And that’s how the whole thing got kicked off. And I want to mention something related to that, which was for the last probably three years, my New Year’s resolutions have been very — they’re very broad, but they’re pretty specific. So I had two. One is doing more delegation, which is figure it out delegation. So what that means is rather than doing what I’m hardwired to do with my OCD and perfectionism, which is, “Here, go do this thing. Let me give you a 20-page installation manual explaining exactly what to do,” versus, “Here’s roughly what I want done. Just figure it out and get it done. I don’t want to make any decisions, So don’t come back to me with 12 options. Just make the best you can.” And I’ll expect Reid Hoffman also, LinkedIn has mentioned this sort of a 10 percent footfall rate, like 10 percent of the time something’s going to go sideways and that’s fine in the interest of reducing decision fatigue and making things faster. So one was more figure it out delegation and number two was sprints with creatives. And for me what that meant as someone who has operated as a lone wolf, which by the way is a contradiction in terms, but who has been a solo operator for most of my creative projects, I was like, “You know what? It just isn’t that fun anymore to do it solo.” And it’s also antithetical to some of the creative projects I want to pursue like a game. I mean, there are some amazing solo game designers. Not to say there aren’t, but I was like, “You know what? I want to try to be more social in my creativity and collaborate with creatives and do sprints.” Now, sometimes those sprints turn into longer things, but those have been sort of my two guiding lights for the last few years, which is what then gave me the ability to build up the courage. It sounds so ridiculous to say, but to actually reach out to you and be like, “Hey, do you want to actually just bat around the possibility of something?” Elan Lee: So from my perspective, that conversation, I got very excited to work with you on something, one, because it turns out you’re just a lovely human being and so much fun to hang out with. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: But two, I asked you that very fundamental question. You said, “Hey, do you want to build a game?” And I said, “Why do you want to build a game?” And your answer was almost identical to what you just related. You talked about your past experiences, you talked about childhood memories of games, you talked about what you like and what you don’t like. And what became very clear to me was there’s something special going on here. Tim wants to treat his friends and his audience to something extraordinary. And we get approached all the time by people who want to make games, big celebrities and singers and actors, all of them want to make a game. And whenever I ask them the question “Why?” the answer is invariably, “Because my agent told me to,” or, “Because I think I can make money,” or really very superficial. Often they’re not game players at all. They have no connection to the experience of game design. And when I spoke to you, none of that was present. Instead it was, “This is a very personal thing to me, and ultimately I want to give a gift.” And that’s when my brain started lighting up. It’s like, “Oh, this is going to be fun. He’s in this for all the reasons I’m in this and that means we can make something very special together.” And I think we have. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, we definitely have. And another question that is sometimes a little tricky to apply, but that has been in my mind for a while, since Seth Godin, very well-known author, thinker, just incredibly sage and awesome human being. He reframed for me, which is the reframing of the question, “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s a good question. Like what would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail? All right, that’s freeing. But the way he tweaks that is he said, “What would you do if you knew you would fail?” In other words, like, what would you do for which the process alone would make it worth it? And for me, because I mean, we became fast friends very quickly, and I was like, “Okay, that’s rare for me as an adult, number one.” And I’ve been banging this around in my own little head for so long. Even if this ends up not making the cut for whatever reason, this seems worth it to me, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because coming back to the people over activities also, I was like, “Love hanging out with Elan and connecting. I am going to learn a lot.” And at the very worst, I learn a lot and we’ve deepened our relationship. And that stuff just snowballs over time. It transcends a single project. So even if this had not manifested, it would’ve been worth it and that’s how I try to pick my projects these days. Elan Lee: So when we first started down this path together, I remember I came out, we sort of visited each other back and forth a few times. And I remember every time I would pack a suitcase full of games and we would sit with some of your friends and we’d play games all night long and you’d say, “I like this one. I don’t like this one. I like this part.” But ultimately, we weren’t making any progress. We were just learning vocabulary, essentially. And I would go home and my wife would be like, “How’d it go? What did you learn? Are you going to make a game together?” And I’d be like, “I don’t know. No, we just hung out and had fun.” And she’d be like, “Wasn’t that a huge disappointment? You traveled 2,000 miles to go see him?” I’m like, “No, it was just fun. Nah, I’m not disappointed at all. We’ll just do it again next month and we’ll see how it goes.” And we did that five or six times. And I remember walking away from each one just thinking, same thing, “If this goes nowhere, I’m having so much fun.” That’s so rare. Tim Ferriss: It is rare. And if you can orient your life or professional life, and look, I’m not saying this is possible for everyone, but it’s to some extent more possible than people realize. You might not be able to run out and invite Elan on your podcast and then awkwardly approach him like a sheepish 12-year-old boy to ask him on a date. But taking the lens of picking projects based on creating or deepening relationships and learning/developing skills, if you just do that over time, it is almost inevitable that you will win, whatever winning means to you. Elan Lee: Yeah, value the process, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So let’s talk a little bit about the origin story. Now, I’ll throw out a couple of things here and we’re going to talk about the game development, and then we’re also going to talk about how to sell this thing. How does that work? Elan Lee: And it’s worth saying, designing a game, I remember you asked me this early on. You started out from the, “Hey, let’s design a game,” and then we’re basically done. And I remember really forcing myself to think through this process because I wanted to explain it to you. “No, that’s half of it. The other half is selling the game. And just as much work goes into that. And if you’re not willing to do it or if you have no mechanism by which you can do it, might as well not design the game because one without the other, useless.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. So it depends on the scale you’re going after, right? If you want to make something for your friends, you can do that. Elan Lee: Sure, Yeah, okay. Fair enough. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But in this particular case, I mean — Elan Lee: You wanted to make something cool and share it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I wanted to share. I wanted to share it. So that kind of dictated parts of the process that we needed to weigh really heavily. So the game development process, I mean, we started off looking at the possibilities of modifying existing games, right? So looking at, say, Poetry for Neanderthals — Elan Lee: Poetry, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — with an alternate set of rules or a different deck plus A, B, or C. We looked at prototype games that you alluded to earlier, bringing the suitcase, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So we did that all over the country. Elan Lee: Yeah, I showed up, I remember. So I have this notebook of game ideas three, 400 in there, and I add more every month. And I remember I picked my favorites, like five or six of them, and I would show up with just the jankiest prototypes. Like, “Here’s something I scribbled on a few cards.” I took some dice and I rubbed out the little nubs on the dice and hand wrote something on all the die faces. “Instead, let’s try playing this weird game.” And you were very patient and you had a lot of vision, thankfully, to look at these just horrible, very hastily created prototypes and say, not, “This is no fun, let’s move on.” But you would always say, “Oh, I like this. I like the — that moment where we had a conversation about what you were going to do next. I like that part. I didn’t like the rest of it, but I like that part.” And that astute sense of notes, really thoughtful and forward moving notes was ultimately what guided our conversation. Because then the next time, I don’t have to pick from 400 games to bring. Now I know, “Okay, this cooperative thing, he liked that conversation aspect. There’s only six games I’ve got like that. Let me bring those six and we’ll refine it even farther.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. So we can talk about the Toronto trip. The Toronto project. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: That is where things started to gel. Because we’d had a number of these meetings around the country where we would do a one to three day sprint of testing, take all these notes and we’d done a few of these and we’ve both got a lot going on and your wife would ask you how it went and you’re like, “Well, I’m not really sure. I think we had fun, but no game as of yet.” And so we scheduled time. I was going to fly to Toronto to do a sprint. You were going to bring in an expert game designer, sort of game mechanic specialist — Elan Lee: Ken Gruhl, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — Ken. And it was like, “Okay, this is the trip. If we make it happen, great. If not, we’re just going to call spade a spade.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We were circling around this thing but not really getting it done. Elan Lee: It was like meeting number eight or nine at that point. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we tried a lot. And it was during that trip that the very primitive sort of germ of an idea started to resonate, which ended up being Coyote. And I remember a few things, and thank God also for Ken’s apparent photographic memory with the way things transpired, but we’re walking around all over the place in Toronto, the three of us, just spitballing. Then it starts to rain and we seek shelter. We failed twice, I think, with various coffee shops. Elan Lee: Yeah, can’t get in. Tim Ferriss: No room, no seats, whatever it might be. End up sitting in this weird kind of multipurpose building. And I remember where we were sitting and we played, I guess in English it’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: Hanabi. Tim Ferriss: Hanabi, which is Hanabi in Japanese, which is fireworks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And hana’s flower. Bi in this case is fire. So it’s like flower fire. That’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: For everybody out there, if you haven’t played Hanabi, go try this game. It is very special. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So we played that game, kind of killing time, giving it a shot, because you guys had mentioned it. And I was like, “Okay, this is a very elegant game.” And from that, liked the cooperative aspect. So when people think game, I think most folks are more familiar, maybe exclusively familiar, with the sort of winner-takes-all or team-versus-team competitive type of game. But I really enjoyed, and I’d seen this in other ways in different capacities, but the cooperative option and the cooperative aspect of this. So that then gets stuck in the mind and the rain clears up. We go for a walk by the water. And I remember we were sort of — well, I’ll own it, I was kind of stalled. I’ll be the kind of hair plugging the drain in the bathtub. Because I was trying to search my mind for game examples. But I was thinking tabletop games because that was the canvas we were painting upon. And we’re walking, we’re walking. We’ve had quite a bit of caffeine by this point and it was either you or Ken, I think it was you, who asked, “Well, just broadly speaking, any kind of game, what games have you really enjoyed?” And that’s where Rock, Paper, Scissors came up, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Rochambeau. And I just — as dumb as it might sound, and I said this at the time, I was like, “I love Rock, Paper, Scissors.” Especially when you play over an extended period of time with friends, maybe there’s some alcohol involved or not, you don’t need to have it involved. But you start to pick up tells, you start to pick up patterns, and it’s actually very, very fun. Elan Lee: So it’s important to note, the moment you bring up Rock, Paper, Scissors in any game design discussion, that’s usually the end of the conversation, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because there’s nothing to that game. There’s three tools, deploy a tool, determine a winner, you’re done. It is only when you say, “Let’s acknowledge Rock, Paper, Scissors is no fun unless you play multiple times.” Because now we’ve made a very important transition. We’re not playing the game anymore, we’re playing each other. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Right? Because I know what you did last time. You think I’m going to throw scissors again. And now we’re playing each other. Yes, rock, paper, scissors are the tools by which we’re playing each other, but suddenly we’re playing a very different game and it starts — it cannot start in round one. It starts in round two and it moves forward from there. And once we started having that discussion, things started to get really interesting. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, things got interesting. And do you want to show the prototype deck? Elan Lee: Yeah, I’ll show. Tim Ferriss: And part of the reason I want to show this prototype deck, and we’ll describe it for people who aren’t watching, is quick and dirty is the fucking way to go. And I will just make another recommendation for Stephen Key. So Stephen Key has a book called the One Simple Idea, which is about licensing and creating inventions. He’s got a number of books now. But Stephen has made a gajillion dollars creating games for all the biggies that you can possibly think of. And he uses construction paper and glue you would find in a second grade class and a handful of markers. Elan Lee: Love it. This is already my — Tim Ferriss: And this is by and large, that is how he creates these amazing — now, when I say — they can be games, they can be toys. He’s pretty broad spectrum. But it might be a new way to play basketball, shooting dirty laundry into a hamper, right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Something like that. And he prototypes these things incredibly quickly. And for him, for what he does, that is enough. He is able to put together a pitch, he’s able to sell it and he’s able to develop these amazing passive income streams with these annuities that just come in — Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: — from all these different places. But that relates to what we’re looking at. Elan Lee: Okay. I love that we have not even described what Coyote is yet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Elan Lee: But that’s okay because it’s more fun I think, to walk — I think the value of this conversation is to actually talk through the creative process and talk through — I think a lot of people want to make games, this is how you do it. And we went through this two-year journey and we arrived at a very happy outcome. So I’m excited to talk about, “Well, let me show you the very ugly, very first deck we ever built.” So we had this conversation about Rock, Paper, Scissors, and I knew there was something there because we were talking about players playing — my fundamental premise behind all game design is games should not be entertaining. Games should make the players entertaining. And suddenly, when you said, “Rock, Paper, Scissors over time,” I was like, “Oh, that’s perfect.” But three tools, rock, paper and scissors, not a very robust tool set. We can’t really play a game that way. So I ran home and started scribbling on cards. These are just blank cards. I took Sharpies, I buy these by the thousands on Amazon. So I had a ton of these and we just started scribbling. And so we made a card that says rock, and we made a card that says paper, and we made a card that says scissors. And we thought, “What if we’re all on the same team? But what if these cards here are not tools to fight with each other? What if these are a challenge that we have to all solve together?” And so we started just putting down a bunch of things, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. And we’re like, “All right, we’ll sit around the table and we’ll all just do this pattern. Everyone do scissors. Now everyone do paper. Now everyone do rock.” Tim Ferriss: And we’d been talking about these different variations and ideas on the walk and then we ended up back at your dining room table — Elan Lee: Yeah, that’s right. Tim Ferriss: — with tons — Elan Lee: Seriously scribbling. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, scribbling and modifying cards as we went. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. So now the modifiers are really the most interesting thing. Because the game that I’m describing right now is useless. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: We can all do scissors and then all do paper. Who cares, right? There’s nothing here. But now we have a baseline. We’re all going to do this thing. Cool, easy. And then we started doing these modifiers, all players do all blue cards. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: So we start scribbling rock, paper, scissors in different colors, and then we’ve got this modifier. So now everyone’s going to — sorry, I’m going to do scissors, but then we’re all going to do paper and then back to you just doing rock, and things like that. And so then it was like, “Okay, well, skip a player after every red card. Okay, shout every blue card,” right? Then we just started writing all these crazy modifiers. I’m just putting all these cards all over the table because the challenge got more and more interesting. And then it was like, “Okay, so something interesting is possible here. Now what if instead of just splashing cards all over the paper, what if we were responsible for this? What if one at a time everyone had to add a new card to the table to make this challenge harder and harder and harder?” And that’s when we started talking about the vocabulary of this game. What are these cards? What makes this thing harder? Rock and paper and scissors very quickly got eliminated from the game because they’re so boring. So we started talking about, “Well, okay, what if you’re making a peace sign?” And then you came up with, “Well, what if you pose a ballerina on a card? And what if you slap the shoulder or the person next to you on a card? And what if you have to — ” I remember one of our earliest notes was, “Eliminate all shouting cards,” because that was no fun at all. Tim Ferriss: We tested that. And then that got all old real quick. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: And also as we’re play testing, right? As we’re inventing mechanics and testing different things. So we play for a few rounds being like, “Okay, that was okay, but what do you guys think of this?” “Okay, we like this aspect.” “Great, let’s make four more of those cards of different colors.” And then we played again. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then we played again. And then we’d iterate and we played again. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And we ended up with, I mean, spreadsheets full of different cards. And this is all still now in cooperative mode at that point. Elan Lee: All in cooperative mode. Tim Ferriss: And — Elan Lee: But over the next week, I would say we designed 80 percent of the game. We were at this stalled-at-one-percent mode for months. And then in a matter of days, 80 percent done. Because we found this every time we played some version of this, the immediate answer when we were done playing was, “Let’s go again.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So is that the litmus test for you? Elan Lee: For sure. Tim Ferriss: I mean in terms of the indicators that something is worth further development, right? Elan Lee: Yeah,. Tim Ferriss: Because you have 400 in your notebook and so you’re not going to develop all of those. What are some of the — could be a water feel that you have, but what are some of the indicators where you’re like, “Oh, okay.” Elan Lee: So there’s two things to talk about here. Certainly “Let’s play again” is a great one, but to set your mind in a place where you’re willing to say, “Imagine this, but tweaked, but something a little different.” There’s this principle I love called the zero effect. Zero effect. Tim Ferriss: Zero effect? Elan Lee: Yeah, zero effect. It’s from a movie, I think, in the late ’80s, early ’90s, somewhere around there called Zero Effect. And there’s this one scene where they explain what the zero effect is. And it is as follows, if you’ve lost your car keys and you’re looking for your car keys, here you are in your living room, you’re looking for car keys, the chances of you finding your car keys are very low because there’s so many things in this room that are not your car keys. So your chances of finding that one thing very, very low. If instead you are trying to find anything, your chances of success are suddenly at a hundred percent. You will find something, as long as you don’t care what it is that you found. That’s my favorite premise for brainstorming and for early testing. Don’t lock in your head, “I’m looking for this particular thing. I must find X. I must find X.” Because the chances that you’re going to find that thing are almost non-existent. But if you can keep your brain open and say, “I’m just looking for something. I don’t care what it is, something, anything, and I’ll tweak it later, I’ll play with it later. I’ll find some way to consider this thing I found my car keys.” As long as you’re willing to make that leap, brainstorming becomes a pleasure. Tim Ferriss: And does that take the form of, “What if, blah?” “What if we blah?” “What if this card did blah?” Elan Lee: Precisely. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is it a series of what ifs? Elan Lee: And you’re not scared for all of those to fail, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because you can come up with those all day long. And that’s what we did, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Over the next few days, that process, “What if, blah. Let’s try it. What if, blah, let’s try it. What if, whatever, let’s try it.” And as long as the answer is always, “Let’s try it,” you will a hundred percent find what you’re looking for. Tim Ferriss: All right, so let’s make some recommendations for people listening or watching. What books or resources would you recommend for people who are interested in game development? Now, I want to reiterate also, whether you think you’re playing games or not, you’re already playing games in life. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So for me, this is a way of putting on a table what we’ve already implicitly agreed to in our own lives in ways that we generally don’t realize, which is we’re all playing games. Now what does that mean? That means that beyond Maslow’s basic rungs on the ladder, shelter, warmth, food, et cetera, at some point, particularly as adults, maybe it’s before you go to school, maybe it’s when you’re in college, but you have decided to play or you have just ended up drafting into a game with certain rules, certain conditions for winning or losing certain ranking mechanisms. And step number one is figuring out what games you’re playing. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So I would suggest that learning about building games helps you to put on x-ray vision glasses, where you start to see the world is comprised of tons of games. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s so true. And you start to dive deeper into game theory. What is the prisoner’s dilemma? What is a zero sum game? If you can start to identify those very fundamental game design concepts in the real world, you can jump to the end of a conversation so much faster. You can avoid so many missteps because everything follows, within reason, everything follows game design principles because this practice, this art form has been so well studied and so well researched and so well documented that you get to take advantage of all of that. And I love that. I use that for my relationships. I use that as playing with my kids. I use that at work all the time. It’s just there’s these fundamental principles of game design. And I’ll talk about a book I’d love that illustrates them. But, yeah, they can be applied to anything. You’re right, you’re playing a game all the time. And the first step is to be aware that you are playing a game. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: All right, so I’ve got two books. Tim Ferriss: Let’s hear it. Elan Lee: One is, let’s see, A Theory of Fun by Raph Koster. Raph Koster? Raph Koster? R-A-P-H, Raph. It’ll outline all these fundamentals. It is the first game design book I ever read. It is the one I go back to and refer to the most often. It’s just got everything and the author is brilliant and go read that book. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: The second one is going to be a little controversial. Tim Ferriss: Memoirs of a Geisha? Elan Lee: It’s called Don’t Shoot the Dog. Tim Ferriss: Oh, this is an exceptional book. Elan Lee: Exceptional book. It is by Karen Pryor. Tim Ferriss: It is not explicitly about game design, at all. Elan Lee: It is not at all about game design. But here’s the thing, this book, the fundamental premise of this book is you are trying to teach a companion, a dog, to behave in a certain way. And the answer to how best to do that is not to, when things go wrong at least, not to blame the dog, is to fundamentally change the way you operate and the way you convey information and the way you look at the world in order to better relate to your dog and to the way that the dog understands and sees the world. It is the best game design principle I have ever encountered in my life. And true, it has nothing to do with game design, but when you’re designing a game, you’re designing it for a target, for someone who isn’t you and you’re not even going to be in the room when they encounter it. And to have in your brain from the very first step, “Every problem that comes up is my problem, not theirs. Every responsibility is my responsibility, not theirs.” And if you can get that in your head and design games that way, those are the games I have found that are the most successful. Tim Ferriss: This is Don’t Shoot the Dog, terrible title, but it is the fundamental starting point that I recommend to anyone who’s interested in dog training. And Karen Pryor is one of the popularizers of clicker training as a way of shaping behavior. I believe she had experience with marine mammals, which by the way, you can’t whack on the butt with a newspaper to punish them, so in other words, negative reinforcement. So how do you do it? You use positive reinforcement. You use clickers or whistles or different tools. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I believe the back of the book, people will be able to fact-check this, but it basically says whether you want to get your dog to heel, your cat to stop laying on the kitchen table, or your mother-in-law to stop nagging you, the principles are all the same. And at the end of it, like you said, is this radical ownership of “It may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility.” Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And in a lot of cases, certainly with game design and instructions and so on, it is actually your fault. If people are confused, it is your fault. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, but it’s the best way. Before I started Exploding Kittens, I designed games for friends and I just had the hardest time. When I wasn’t in the room, people were not enjoying those games. And it was only once I read that book that I realized the fault is absolutely mine. Because I’m trying to get them to have as much fun as I want them to have and the fact that they’re not, I keep blaming them. And that’s so wrong. Tim Ferriss: So what did you do? How did you fix that? Elan Lee: There’s basically two parts. One starts with design. One says the game has to be so simple that it is almost self-correcting. And I have to strip out all complication, I have to remove all nuance. Any time I’m thinking of the rules and I say, “Okay, if this happens, then this happens, except if — ” The moment I say “except,” I’ve gone down a wrong path. I need to get rid of all of that stuff. That was the first part. And then the second part is in writing the actual instructions and figuring out how — if I’m sitting in the room, you’re going to get this game because I’m going to explain it and I’m going to be enthusiastic. And when you ask a question, I’m going to answer the question. And when you get confused, I’m going to clarify it. I can a hundred percent do that. But a piece of paper trying to do that same thing, I have to write it as if I’m in the room and I have to anticipate those questions and I have to cut them off before they come up and I have to correct behavior because I know exactly where you’re going to go off course and fix it in the instructions. And that kind of one-two punch changed my game design from like 10 percent of the people get this to 95 percent of the people get this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, one aspect — I mean there’s so many aspects, but one aspect of this that I enjoyed was related to the instructions. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so number one, you make it really clear in the instructions, which we both poured over ad nauseum. But reading is the worst way to learn a game. Go watch this video, QR code. So that’s number one. But if you’re going to put it into text — and I think I’m pretty good at this, but I was very impressed with your ability to identify anything that could be misunderstood or that wasn’t yet defined or that could be taken with another more broader connotation that would steer people off course. And the number of edits in that Google Doc. Elan Lee: I mean, it’s got to be in the hundreds, right? Tim Ferriss: From all of us, hundreds and hundreds of edits. Elan Lee: So the most important skill is you will write better instructions, you will convey information to people better if you can clear your mind. If you can approach any set of instructions from the perspective of the things I know I do not yet know, and the words that come out of my mouth have to not only fill my brain with the required knowledge — Tim Ferriss: I see basically beginner’s mind, right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Putting yourself in the place of someone who has never seen this before. Elan Lee: Exactly. And it’s so hard to do because you have this information in your head. It must be there, otherwise you’re not going to be able to explain the thing. But to back all the way up and say, “I’m just going to split my brain in two. There’s this one reading script and I know the information I have to get out, but the other half is the recipient of that script and it knows nothing.” If you can do that — and it’s so hard, it takes so much practice. If you can do that, you’re going to not only be able to design good games and write good instructions, but you’re also going to be able to just converse more effectively just out in the world in general. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. All right. You mentioned I think it was two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What other golden or guiding tenets do you have for yourself when you’re doing game design within Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: Oh, good question. If a component does not need to be in the game, remove it from the game. Tim Ferriss: Right. So an example of that would be we had these chits or little chips, like poker chips. Elan Lee: Like bingo chips. Tim Ferriss: Like bingo chips that we were using for lives or strikes, and turns out you don’t need that. You can use — Elan Lee: Yeah, because you’ve got a whole thing of cards right here, just use those. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You can use cards by flipping them over and using the back of the card. Elan Lee: Exactly. That’s a perfect example. Right? We have this thing where we’re like, “Hey, you know what would be fun is if everybody had a big hand of cards and we’re going to play cards and you make decisions.” I’m like, “I get that.” Most games you play, you have a hand of cards and you’re going to play a card and you’re making a decision. That’s awesome. But you know what? That’s a private moment and you reveal a card. Every game you’ve ever played. When you play UNO, you’ve got a hand of cards, you’re making a decision, you play a card, you’ve revealed what card you just played. And I remember thinking, “Is there a simpler version of that?” And it turns out there is. And the simpler version in Coyote is take some cards, put them all face up on the table, and then decide which one you’re going to pick. That’s very similar to having a deck of cards, but now it’s public. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s public. Elan Lee: Right? Tim Ferriss: And also when the competitive version was brought in, which is the way that I like to play, the way I would suggest people play, but you can warm up with cooperative or if you have somebody in your life or in your family who just cannot lose without creating a huge pain in the ass, then the cooperative mode is really fun. But the competitive mode then allows the group decision on which card to play potentially, although ultimately that’s individual. That has implications for cooperative when it’s public. But also for competitive. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: There are a number of tweaks made to this, but I mentioned earlier, sabotaging. So we had competitive, but different minds are wired for different games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so, God forbid, what happens to you is what happened to one of my employees who was play testing this, where one of the people in the group was a mathematician who also is high-level chess player if I remember correctly. Elan Lee: Oh, no. Tim Ferriss: And he just smoked everyone because he had the mind for it. Elan Lee: Yeah, of course. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what do you do for that? Well, we ended up — and this took a lot of play testing to ultimately land on this. And I want to ask you about play testing, particularly if it’s kind of hands off the wheel and you have people playing the game without you. Elan Lee: Yeah, terrifying Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Realized — and this comes back to the underdog being able to win, not getting my ass smoked in Magic over and over again by someone who’s just got better hardwiring for it. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: And that’s where the attack cards came from. Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So there are these attack cards in the deck, which to the simplification side, you can play in cooperative mode to modify a card. I don’t want to get too in the weeds. Elan Lee: Well, I want to give you more credit for this because I don’t think you’re taking enough credit. All right, let me phrase this a different way. So the basic premise of the game is we have a whole bunch of activities on the table, right? Ballerina, peace sign, whatever it is, thumbs up, thumbs down, smile, frown. Tim Ferriss: Lean and make a fart noise. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly, lean and make a fart noise. So we’ve got all these things that we’re all going to do. And then on top of that — Tim Ferriss: It’s a fan favorite. Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s such a good card. On top of that, we have all these modifier cards and they modify — you have to skip a player after this one, ignore this card, do this one twice. Tim Ferriss: Those are generally the Coyote cards. Elan Lee: The Coyote cards. And you had this great idea, you said, “Because some players are naturally gifted at this game, far more so than others, and because some players are going to naturally fall behind and they need a way to sabotage the first place.” If you’re in last place, you need a way to sabotage the first place player. If you’ve ever played Mario Kart, you know this feeling very well. And you said, “What if we took some of these modifiers, every time — all players have to do all the blue cards with one hand instead of two.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But what if instead of all the blue — Tim Ferriss: Or Tyrannosaurus arms. Elan Lee: Or Tyrannosaurus arms, you have to do all your movements with Tyrannosaurus arms. What if instead of playing that on all blue cards on the table, what if you just put that, slide it right in front of another player and now only they have to do it? For every single one of their turns. You’ve put a curse on them. The last place player has attacked the first place player. And I remember thinking, “Tim, you’re like a natural game designer.” That’s such a nice moment and it’s such an easy modification. And of course my answer was, “I don’t know, let’s try it.” And then we tried it and it was glorious. And I love moments like that for two reasons. One is because you had learned at that point to speak like a game designer. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Instead of saying, “I think we just need to sabotage people,” instead you said, “Some people are really good at this game. We have to address that. Some people are naturally bad at this game. We need to give them a tool.” And those terms, speaking in that language, armed with that vocabulary, suddenly the answer to you became so clear, like, “Here’s how we solve those problems.” That’s great. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: I guarantee you would not have been capable of that when we started this process. Tim Ferriss: No way. Yeah, no, I wouldn’t have had the — sometimes artists talk about the visual library, just the exposure to different types of artwork, different forms, different silhouettes, different structures so that they can pull from that visual library to inform whatever they’re trying to build or solve for. And it’s the same with game design, same with everything. You need to build your ABCs so you can convey what you’re trying to say in terms that are solvable, if that makes any sense. Elan Lee: Yeah. Totally. You’re a quick study too. Tim Ferriss: Helped getting the books that you recommended. All right, so I’m not going to dox my friend in question. But as long-term listeners will know, I was, in a former life, a neuroscience major and then, in the last 10 years, have funded a lot of science. I always have just had this hankering and this dream of being involved in neuroscience; it continues to this day. And in the process of building this game — and this is not how I necessarily sell it, because this is going to sound terrible, but through many experiments with different companies and so on, I’ve concluded that even though generally Americans, I’ll throw it on Americans, I’m American, say they want to be smarter, they will typically not pay for something that is designed to make them smarter unless it’s a magic pill, and then sometimes the answer is yes. But what I was hoping to also do with this game is to create something that would — and this has not been proven, there’s no randomized controlled study examining this, although that might change at some point. — is to design something that would help those players who are not good at this, or the people who are in the middle of the bell curve or the people who are good to get better. And for people who are interested in looking at some — they’re not perfect analogs, but they’re similar. People can check out the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST. It’s a neurophysiological test used to assess cognitive flexibility in executive functions, particularly the ability to shift cognitive sets and learn from feedback. All right, so participants must sort cards based on an initially unknown rule, which changes after a certain number of correct sorts. Now this is not a perfect parallel because that does not, in and of itself, make for a fun game. Right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: So fun number one, lots of probably rank ordered like one, two, three, four, five. But could I also Trojan horse in — Elan Lee: Yeah, love it. Tim Ferriss: — cognitive training. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I think the answer — this is from a lay perspective, and obviously I’m biased because I’m involved in every step, I’m making this thing, but I think it does the trick. And what people will notice is, and you know this too, the game starts off so easy. Elan Lee: There’s nothing to it. Tim Ferriss: And people are like, “There’s nothing to it.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then once a modifier or two comes out, people are like, “Oh, oh, wait a second, this is getting really tricky.” And if, for instance, I’ve had lifelong insomnia, you want to sleep better, play this game before you go to bed. And by the end you will feel like you just did a workout, a full brain workout for your cognition. Elan Lee: You know what I love about that part? I learned to play the drums years and years ago, and I remember I would learn these new patterns and it was like your right hand has to do this and your left hand has to do this, and your right leg has to do this and your — and I remember thinking, “No way, no way. I can’t do that.” And you work at it and you work at it and you work at it and suddenly it starts to click, just a little bit. Like, “Oh, my right hand did the right thing.” And it’s like you can feel new neurons coming to life. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Your brain is doing something that five minutes ago you could not do. This is the first game I’ve ever played that does that exact same thing. And I remember the first time I felt that way in a very early play test, my eyes got all wide and I was like, “There is something magical going on here. I know I’m psyching myself out, but I feel new things happening in my brain because five minutes ago I could not do this pattern and now I can. We can go all the way around the table and you can add a new card and I will still be able to do this pattern that I couldn’t do just five minutes ago.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. And what’s cool as well is you get to see just how specialized certain minds are and where you might have an Achilles heel. So for instance, and this is true for some folks, we have the modifiers ranked by difficulty just so you can — because ultimately with Coyote, you’re in charge of how hard you make the game. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. That’s right. That’s right. Tim Ferriss: You are in full charge of how easy, moderate, or difficult you make it. And we didn’t even talk about how this game is designed to make you a game designer. We’ll talk about that with the blank cards. But this is a sort of creativity unlock as much as a game. That’s the intention behind it, which is part of the reason that I’m really excited to see what the hell it does when it’s released into the wild, which effectively is now. Elan Lee: That’s going to — Tim Ferriss: Now the specialization piece, I’ll just speak to that. So for instance, for me, skipping turns, skipping players, it is a blind spot. It is an Achilles heel for me. That’s true for quite a few folks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But for other people, for instance, if we’re going around the table, most people would be familiar with “We Will Rock You.” Elan Lee: “We Will Rock You,” yeah. Tim Ferriss: So it’s like boom, boom, boom, boom. So the way you play the game is you go around is you go “Boom, boom,” and you can hit the table with your hands. You can do it with closed fists. You could probably clap it if you want, but it’s boom, boom. And then one person does the move. Like let’s take the ballet, we’re going to do a pirouette. You have to do the motion and you have to say the motion. So then these two things can be split or confused later. We want to get — Elan Lee: We’ll get to that later. Tim Ferriss: — too deep into that. And then it’s boom, boom, next person, boom, boom, next person. And it goes around. And then it just gets more and more complicated. So I remember when we were first experimenting with the modifier that said, okay, it’s now three bumps instead of two. So it’s boom, boom, boom. And then the move. And there were, I remember, I’m not going to call them out, but there’s one person who just could not do it. Elan Lee: I know. I was one of those people. My brain would start melting out of my ears at that point. I don’t know why though. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. It’s weird. It’s weird. So they’re very specific. You’ll find each person will have a super strength and a super weakness, and you’ll figure it out by playing this game. And just from a game design perspective also, I’d love to hear you talk about finding the sweet spot. I mean, we could talk about Bushnell’s law of Atari fame, the game, I’m paraphrasing here, but a good game is easy to learn and difficult to master. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But how do you, in the course of play testing, working with prototypes find the sweet spot of difficulty? Because with this game, well, through making this game, I’ve just really come to appreciate how hard it is to create a game where people experience that sweet spot. Because if you were to take Coyote and make it too easy, what a simple game to make. Elan Lee: Sure. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you wanted to make it basically impossible and not fun to play, also very easy. But to find that sweet spot on the graph is incredibly challenging. Elan Lee: Yeah. So the way I think about this is when you first encounter any game, the first thought that has to go into your brain is, “I can do that.” You hear it described, and you have to think, “I can do that.” And then you have to try the game and that has to be reinforced. The game has to say, “Yep, you can do that.” And you have to feel like, “Okay, I thought I could do it. I can do it. This is great.” But that’s only going to last a few seconds. The next thought that has to go into your brain is, “I understand the path to mastery. I understand how to get better at this.” And then the next thought is, “And I can do that too.” So you have to see the moment a modifier card comes out, or the moment any complication happens in your favorite game, it has to stop you dead in your tracks. It has to be like, “Ooh, the thing I just did to start the game and was really good at, I thought I could do it. I could do it. That’s not going to work here. I have to rethink my strategy, or I have to get better at something else.” And then those two follow-up thoughts have to show up in quick succession: “I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And that’s really the art to me of that ramping up of game design. And you have to keep hitting that “I think I can do that”; “Yes, you can. Now you can’t anymore, but you know what you have to do and you can do that too.” And then that’s going to get blocked. And you think, “Okay, now what? Now I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And you have to just keep hitting those two things. And it’s rinse and repeat over and over and over again. And if you can hit that, you are just holding somebody’s hand from the beginning of the game to the end of the game. And they’re going to get great at it, they’re going to achieve that sense of mastery over time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and if you, listening or watching, have any game that you consider simple that you enjoy, rest assured there was an absurd, absurd amount of development and testing and revising that went into it. And just to give you an example, this is by all outward appearance a very simple game. And the three to eight players you could probably play with more, 10 minutes, says age is 10 plus. I’ve seen people playing with their kids who are much younger and it’s actually hilarious and super fun. There are so many levers you can pull here. You have the action cards, which are these cute little salamander cards with the different motions and gestures and so on. You’ve got just the sheer number of cards. How many variants do you have? How many total cards do you have? How many Coyote versus attack cards? When you have a fully shuffled deck, what does that actually look like? There’s so many different variables that you have to think through. Elan Lee: Yeah. And we even set up, one of my favorite things is we’re starting to see people compete now. So we set up this page of, here are table configurations. Here’s an array of cards in exactly this order with exactly these modifiers. This one’s hard, this one’s impossible. This one is going to kill you. And we’ve started to see, the game is barely available so far, but we started to see some people try to tackle those challenges. Tim Ferriss: Oh, fun. Okay. I didn’t even know that. Elan Lee: It’s incredible. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so where this came from also is in The 4-Hour Chef a million years ago, came out in 2012, which was actually a book about accelerated learning, confusingly. But putting that aside, there were a few recipes in that book. I think one was called Dragon Force Chaconne or something like that, which was named after this video game track that people found impossible to play on guitar. And then there was something, a La Ancienne, which was this just ludicrously complex French dish that involved fish. And I was like, okay, look, if you’ve done everything up to this point and you want to take a quantum leap forward and try something that is considered effectively impossible by most people, here you go. And so that’s what we created on this particular page. Elan Lee: I will just say, having tested all of the challenges on that page, I can do exactly one of them. The last two are so hard. Tim Ferriss: They really are. Elan Lee: And we’ve already seen someone, a table of six people succeed — Tim Ferriss: Oh, wow. Okay — Elan Lee: — at the middle one. They’ve already done it. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts. Elan Lee: Yeah. I’ve never seen anyone do the crazy hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But it’s coming. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So people can check it out. And there may or may not be a bunch of excitement around that. So I will just say there may be incentives later to be good at this game. I will leave it at that for now. So I tell you what, we’re going to come back to some of the blank cards and we’ll talk about those features. But let’s talk about a bit more of the process of making any game. We could talk about Coyote specifically of course, because you have a process for this. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How many games per year do you guys put out on average? Elan Lee: So it’s funny, I actually built this out as a graph. So our first year we did one, our second year we did two. Our third year we did two again. Last year we did 14. This year we’ll do 23, I think. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s a lot. But we’ve built this, it’s really fun, we’ve built this incredibly robust pipeline from design all the way through to testing and then sales and then marketing. And I feel obligated to just keep that pipeline full because it’s such a beautiful thing we built. So we do a lot of games. Tim Ferriss: All right, let’s get some info that we wouldn’t normally have any access to. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: If you do an 80/20 analysis, it’s not going to be exactly 80/20, but you get where I’m going, on your best-selling games, what’s on the leaderboard? What are the top X number of games? Five, three, four, whatever the number. Elan Lee: Well, up until last year, number one, the top-selling game in the world amongst all games was Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts, man. Elan Lee: It’s nuts. Tim Ferriss: Congratulations. Elan Lee: It makes no sense, but I’ll tell you something I’m even more proud of. It’s now number two. Number one is a game called Hurry Up Chicken Butt. Hurry Up Chicken Butt is a game I designed with my four-year-old daughter, and she did most of the design. And it is outselling Exploding Kittens. It is selling one game every four seconds. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s nuts. And it was designed by a four-year-old. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so we’ve got a Hurry Up Chicken Butt, Exploding Kittens. Elan Lee: Yeah. The next few spots in the global sales are constantly shifting. Everybody’s fighting for those, but we always have — our entries into that list, which are constantly shifting, Poetry for Neanderthals is usually number three. Throw Throw Burrito is usually either number five or six, and the rest are just totally random. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Okay, got it. So what has made Hurry Up Chicken Butt a success? Elan Lee: Yeah. So remember what I said, if you have the best design game in the world — Tim Ferriss: And by the way, when we spoke I think two years ago — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — you were just beginning to talk about this. I don’t think it had launched at that point. Elan Lee: No, it hadn’t. Yeah. Yeah. It has been an absolute rocket ship. Tim Ferriss: What are the magic ingredients? Why has it worked? Because not all games do that. Elan Lee: Yeah. No, they don’t. Tim Ferriss: And you’ve had now, with the number of games that EK, Exploding Kittens, has developed, you’ve had a chance to see a lot of different ideas come through the doors and go out the doors. Elan Lee: Yeah. Some games last a season, some games last a decade. So when I was designing games — okay, so Hurry Up Chicken Butt in particular, I wrote a list of the things I wanted that game to accomplish. And my daughter had all these ideas, “Here’s what I want to do, and you’re going to do this and you’re going to run up and jump up and down and blah.” But I had a list of things that I needed to know were in this game in order for me as a parent to buy it for my kid. And they were as follows. The game has to be as much fun for me to play as it is for my daughter. That’s a hard one. Tim Ferriss: That’s hard. Elan Lee: That killed most designs that we came up with. Number two, my daughter has to be able to beat me at this game, even though I’m not letting her win. Holy crap is that a hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: Number three, the game cannot have any losers. It can have a winner, but it cannot have any losers. Those three were my guiding lights. It was like, I need to check off these three check boxes for this game to be good. And we worked on a hundred million designs. She’s great. She’ll just be like, “Oh, you don’t like this one? Here’s another one. You don’t like that one? Here’s another one.” And she just kept firing them off. And we finally got to this game that hit all three of those. That, as I said earlier, is only half the battle. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that’s the necessary, but not sufficient — Elan Lee: Exactly. So now we have a game that I’m in love with, that we play every single night that she can beat me at regularly. And I am trying my absolute hardest to beat her. And this four-year-old is kicking my ass at this game. Love that. Love it. And I’m having a blast. Tim Ferriss: So this is my first time hearing about these criteria. Just for people listening, this is all new to me. Elan Lee: When my daughter got old enough to start playing games right around when she turned four, we went out and bought all these games and I just hated them. They were so boring and I hated playing. And so we just designed our own. We just made them better. And it was important for me to have that list. ‘Cause unless I know what success looks like, I’ll just stay in brainstorming mode forever. So I made that list, finally hit it, and then we entered into part two. And here my daughter has very little to do with it. Here’s where I sit down with the marketing and sales team and I was like, “What the hell are we going to call this thing?” And we went through a thousand different names. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know the feeling. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we did that. But once I had 10 names that I really liked, we sat down with my daughter and all her friends and I would just read them off. And there was no contest. I got to Hurry Up Chicken Butt and they’re like just laughing hysterically, jumping up and down. They didn’t even want to hear the rest of the names. I was like, okay. Sold. So that was a really nice step forward. It was like, I know I’ve got a game that’s just fire for kids. They’re just so excited about this. And the next thing was, all right, well what do we make this box look like? And I was like, I know it has to be — the game itself involves a character and a die shaker and some sound effects. It’s got all this stuff packed into this character, this chicken. And I was like, I can’t just hide that. I have to put that in a box where you can see it. And that was really hard. The difference between box design for an iPhone and a game is an iPhone will spend a hundred dollars on that box with the materials and making it beautiful. And when you open your iPhone, you take the box and you throw it away. In a game, you’ve got about 40 cents to spend on the box and it has to last forever. It sucks. The equation is totally backwards, but I needed a thing that displayed the chicken and told you it made noise and lets you shake around the die and still hold its structure as a box so that you could remove this thing, play with it, and then reinsert it into the box in a way that isn’t going to mess with the integrity of the box — its structural integrity. So that was really hard, but we finally solved that. And then — Tim Ferriss: Did you do that before or after you started testing the waters with retailers? Elan Lee: After. Tim Ferriss: After? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. I don’t want to hijack, but whenever it makes sense, I would love to know how, at what point you start testing the waters with Elan Lee: Well, we do this backwards. And when we started, you have to do it the opposite way. You have to walk into those sales pitches and you have to say, “Here’s the final product. Look how beautiful it is. You don’t have to trust us that this is going to sell. You can look at this thing and know that it’s going to sell.” For this game, luckily, because we have a really good track record, we walked in with no box. All I walked in with was a rough idea, a name scribbled on a piece of paper. And I said, “Trust me, this is going to be great. We’re going to solve everything. It’s going to be amazing.” And they said, “Okay, yeah, sold. Let’s buy it.” That comes from 10 years of pitching them hit after hit after hit. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So if it were earlier in Exploding Kittens’ existence, you go in with the finished box. Elan Lee: Yeah. They’re never taking a flyer on that. Tim Ferriss: Who creates the finished box? Do you guys create it in-house? How do you prototype something like that? Elan Lee: Yeah, we have an incredible team. We have a large scale printer. We print on actual cardboard. We have a paper folder so we can actually build the boxes. Which was an investment, that’s not off-the-shelf machinery, but it helps — okay, so look, normally whatever manufacturer you’re working with, they send you a prototype box. Because they make it and they want you to see the final product and that’s what you go into the sales meetings with. You say, “Look, here’s the box. Here’s how much it’s going to weigh. Here’s the final presentation. We’ve been working on it for a year and a half. Here it is.” I walk into those meetings like, “I got an idea, I’ve been working on it for three weeks. I want you to buy it right now. I don’t have any materials to show you.” So it’s a different kind of pitch that I’m very proud of because I’ve earned that and we haven’t ever let them down. Tim Ferriss: So in the case of Coyote, there was a lot of play testing that was done before we ended up in line review meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Wow. We skipped that whole part, didn’t we? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: So could you talk about your secret cabal of families? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Secret cabal of families. I love it. All right, so — Tim Ferriss: Another chapter for your memoir. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. That’s a good title there. So, okay, so here’s how most game companies test games. If you had partnered with a different games company, here’s what your experience would’ve been like. “All right, we got a game. We really like it. It’s really fun, lots of internal testing. Everyone’s on board. We now need external testing.” And they go to these market research groups and they pull strangers in and they sit in a room with a one-way mirror and they show the game and they play the game with people they don’t know and they order in some crappy catered lunch and they play the game and then they rate it on a scale of one to 10 and they fill out this form that’s like, “Here’s what I liked and here’s what I didn’t like and here’s what I would improve.” And then you get to watch those videos and they present you back all these forms and you get to make a determination. Okay. Nobody plays games like that. You don’t play games with strangers. When was the last time you played a board game with a stranger? Tim Ferriss: Can’t even remember. Elan Lee: It doesn’t happen. Right? The testing procedure that all these other companies go through is fundamentally flawed. They’re using a resource because it’s the only resource that exists. So I sat down, that’s what we did our first time. We went through one of those companies and they gave us all the results. And I looked at these results and I was like, oh, my God, we just burned $25,000 on this thing and it’s useless. So I realized at that moment, because nothing better exists, we’re going to have to build it ourselves. So I started reaching out to, at first our Kickstarter community and then our Discord community and then our Reddit community as we grow and grow and grow and said, “Look, I got a bunch of prototypes. I need families and friends who get together regularly to play games and I’m going to mail you a free game. You don’t even have to send it back to me, it’s yours forever. You get this amazing prototype. All I ask in return is upon receiving it within 24 hours, you play the game with your friends and family and you record the session and you send me that video. And that’s it. That’s all I want in return.” And within about 12 months, we had 400 families sign up for this thing. They are called our kiddie test pilots. And they’re this incredible group of enthusiastic game players that give us the best feedback. And we don’t have them fill out a questionnaire. All we ask them at the end of the test session, we say, “Look into the camera and answer one question. The only question we care about, do you want to play again?” And we know a game is ready when everybody looks into that lens and says, “Hell, yes!” And that’s it. That’s our testing process. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the pass/fail marks or green versus red signals that you look for? In other words, I imagine the response rate could vary, but you don’t know if that’s because people are busy or if it’s the wrong time of year or maybe they looked at the game, the box, and so on and it just didn’t sell them so they didn’t play it. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Is that something you pay attention to? Are the people, I’m sure I’m not the only person wondering this, if they’re part of this special VIP get free game group, are they disincentivized to say, “Hell no, I would not play this game again.” So do you get a false positive signal? Elan Lee: I see. Tim Ferriss: How do you think through what constitutes a thumbs up versus a thumb sideways versus a thumbs down? Elan Lee: Yeah. There are a lot of false positives for sure. And there’s no way I can solve that problem. We prompt them in advance. We’re like, “Look, we need honestly — this game will get great if you tell us that something’s broken with it. We need to know that.” And they’re motivated because we also send them the final version of the game. So they know that’s coming, they know a better version is coming if they help us make it better. So some of the problem is solved that way, but not all of it. So that’s why the video is so important. Tim Ferriss: So they say, “We had a great time,” and you’re watching and you’re like, they are not having a great time. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Look, count the number of eye rolls. Or you know a great one, they’ll take the instructions — I love this. They’ll open the instructions. And when you see that eyes go wide and they inhale. Tim Ferriss: Pull back and they’re like — Elan Lee: It’s like, “Oh, fuck.” Tim Ferriss: Instruction apnea. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. Elan Lee: Something, that’s terrible. Right? And that’s really important. And there’s no survey in the world they can fill out that’s going to tell me that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You need to watch the moment they see the instructions. Tim Ferriss: Because they may not even realize they’re doing it. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: So how are they going to report it? Elan Lee: Yeah. And that’s why the video is so important. And we have very specific instructions for the video. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, what are they? Because I’m wondering how in the hell do you review 400 videos? Elan Lee: Oh, well one, we watch them at 4X speed and two is we’ve got a whole team of people that watch them and they flag moments. They don’t even say why this moment is important. Something happened here, something happened here. I’m going to go on to the next video now. And then the next group of people will go through and look at those flags and say, “Oh, big, deep inhale. Rules confusion.” Tim Ferriss: Nerd question, what do you use software wise for flagging stuff? Elan Lee: Vimeo. Tim Ferriss: Vimeo, okay. So you have people upload their videos to Vimeo? Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Elan Lee: Yeah, so this whole process takes months and it’s really important. And the other thing is, I’ve got 400 test families, but I’m only going to send out five games at a time. The reason is I need to collect that feedback, make changes, and send out the next batch. Otherwise, I’ve got 10 results for a version and it’s useless. I know what the next five are going to be like ’cause I saw them on the first five. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So is it then, just to state my understanding, with the kiddie test pilots, you basically have — you’re not sending out the same version to 400, 600 people at once? Elan Lee: Five at a time. Tim Ferriss: Five at a time. And then you look at that cohort and see what comes back? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. It’s always the same stuff. Tim Ferriss: Then you tweak and then it goes out to the next group. Elan Lee: Yeah, the next five. Tim Ferriss: Over what period of time do you get a prototype to the max number who are going to receive it? Elan Lee: Usually I would say six to eight months. And we’re tweaking two things. One is we’re tweaking gameplay, but much more commonly we’re tweaking the instructions. Because gameplay has already survived internal testing. So we know the game is fun. If we know this game is fun and then we watch a video of people not having fun, chances are it’s the instructions, not the game. And so that’s what we start attacking at that moment. Tim Ferriss: Got it. What are some of the risks of internal testing? ‘Cause I’ve always wondered, for instance, when I have, as I’m doing right now, doing a bunch of writing and I have people proofreading or test reading my writing, I do not only do it with professional writers. I mean they’re very good and I know I’m very fortunate to know some amazing writers, but they’re also a little too close to the material. It’s like a travel writer who can’t stop looking at their travel experience through the lens of a writer. They have lost the ability to just travel and have fun. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the risks, if any, of internal testing? Elan Lee: So you and I have the same instinct here. I remember when we were testing this game internally, hadn’t gone out the door yet. Tim Ferriss: This game? Elan Lee: This game, Coyote. Yeah. I remember you would say, “Hey, can you show me test results? But can you have your accounting team test it instead of your game design team?” And I remember thinking, yeah, that’s what we do. I’m not interested in the game design team’s results. So I would show you the accounting team results and I would show you the sales people, the sales team’s results, who hadn’t even ever seen the game. Our internal testing starts out with the game design team, of course, but very quickly has to move on to the other teams, specifically the other teams who have never seen the game and don’t know the background. Because those are really the only tests that we care about. So your instinct is perfect there, and I’m very happy to say you didn’t have to teach us that, we already knew that part. Tim Ferriss: I mean, if I’m teaching you anything, I don’t know what it would be other than my obsessive focus on — I’m sorry for the volume of email and the volume of text messages and the volume of everything. Elan Lee: Every single one of those made the game better. Truly. Truly. I mean, okay, look, we’ve only done, we’ve done, I think two partnerships total. Three partnerships total. We did a game with Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller. We did a game with Jeff Probst of Survivor, and now we’ve done a game with Tim Ferriss. You probably sent more notes than the other two combined. Tim Ferriss: I sent a lot of notes. Sent a lot of notes. I really had a blast with it. And I remember this moment, and I’m wondering if this happened before or after the line review meetings. I think it might’ve been afterwards, but you could place it for me because this is my first game and I don’t put my name on anything. That was part of the very, very truthful pitch. It’s not like one of, I don’t have Tim Ferriss microwave enchiladas and Tim Ferriss sneakers. And then just as an aside, I have the Tim Ferriss game. It’s like, no, no, no, I don’t put my name on anything. So I take it very, very seriously. And I think it was, tell me if I’m getting this wrong, pretty sure it was Carly, who’s amazing. Elan Lee: Carly is the president of Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Carly is incredible. And because there’s always a fear, for me at least, where it’s like, maybe internally I think it’s great, and then it gets released into the wild and then, oh, shit there’s a real problem. Like Houston, we have a problem. Elan Lee: Yeah, and you can’t take it back. Tim Ferriss: Right. So what do you do? And I remember Carly, I want to say, sent a text to me. She was in, I want to say Germany at some type of gaming convention or meeting of distributors. I don’t remember the exact context, but she said Coyote was belle of the ball. She’s like, “You would not believe we had an entire huge room full of people playing, smashing on the tables over and over and over and over again.” And I was like, whew. Elan Lee: Yeah. Isn’t that a great feeling? Tim Ferriss: Okay, here we go, LFG. Elan Lee: She sent me a video of that. So just to set the stage there, there are 2,000 people that — sorry, there’s 2,000 people at this hotel of the 25 hotels that are part of this convention. And there’s one games room and there’s 10 tables in there. And the idea is there should be a different game at every table. And everyone’s testing out the games and sampling them. And we put Coyote on one table and almost immediately people started gathering around. And so those people said, “Can we just grab another copy and we’ll just put it on the next table just so not everyone has to gather around this one table?” ‘Cause it looked so intriguing. And so they sent it to another table. And then by the time Carly sent me a video, it was at every table in the room. It was just an entire hotel playing this one game because nobody wanted to play anything else. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Elan Lee: It was so neat. It was so neat. And how gratifying? We’ve been killing ourselves on this thing. And to see an audience receive it and say, thank you for the gift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. And also, I mean, I said it to you guys and look, it says technically it says age 10 plus. So I don’t want to contradict that, but if you’re willing to modify the rules, which is something that I encourage, and we have that in the instructions, house rules, feel free to modify the rules. But I sent you guys the video of my friend’s four-year-old after she played, which was like this — Elan Lee: So good! Tim Ferriss: It was such an amazing video. And this is the first thing I’ve ever done that can include families and kids directly/ Elan Lee: Easily. Tim Ferriss: Where it’s like, four-year-old, 10-year-old is not going to have any interest or necessarily the capacity to read one of my phone books that are like 600 pages long. It’s not going to happen. So this is also so much fun to finally now that it’s kind of released into the wild to start seeing these things bubbling up that I hoped would be there. Elan Lee: It’s the reason you make a game. You want to share an experience that then the recipients get to share with those people that they love. That’s why you make a game. That’s exactly what we’ve made here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So let’s talk about the selling process a little bit more. Because you said, there’s the game development, there’s building the game, there’s crafting the game. But there is an equally important part, which is how do you get this thing into people’s hands? And for that you need distribution. So this is going to be a callback. Remember that line review at the very beginning and then I took us on a very meandering path, but there was a point to it. How do you pitch big retailers? How does that happen? And how did you do it in the beginning of Exploding Kittens and how — I know it’s changed over time as you’ve built your track record, but nonetheless you still need to do it. And actually, here’s a data point that most people will never hear anyone talk about. What percentage of your sales are offline retail versus online? Elan Lee: Yeah. All right, we’ll start there. Yeah, we never share these numbers, but for you, Tim — Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: — here we go. 70 percent of our sales are in-person retail. Only 30 percent are online sales. Totally backwards than what you’d expect for almost any industry. But yeah, people like to walk into a store, they like to see and touch and feel the game and flip it over and read the back and compare it to the other games. And that’s where we sell our games. Which means not only do I need tremendous retail buy-in, those sales meetings are so important, those line reviews. But also the game has to sell itself on the shelf. When you’re walking down that games aisle, 70 percent of our audience does this. You need to look at all the game, hundreds of games, and you need to stop dead in your tracks on this one. And you need to say, “Ooh, what’s that?” And that starts at that line review, starts with getting them to say, not only are we going to commit to this game, but we’re going to put it in multiple locations. So you see it more than once. Very important. Also, we work with them to figure out the color scheme. And you and I, we did tons of surveys on the color scheme and the character and everything to stop people in their tracks. Tim Ferriss: So just a quick sidebar. I know I keep doing this, but some of you may remember, and for those who never heard it I’ll just tell you, from my very first book, 4-Hour Workweek, I used Google AdWords to test the top, let’s just call it 10 title and subtitle contenders. So I bid on keywords that were related to the subject matter in the book. And then the sponsored results, the ads were automatically split tested, like multivariate tested by Google. They will do this automatically. And then all of the URLs, I had different URLs for each title option. They just took people to an under construction page. Because I didn’t care about conversion, I cared about interest, sufficient interest click. And that is how I figured out the title. And then for the cover, back in the day, I went to Borders, which was on University Ave. in Palo Alto. And I had a counter, like you might see from a bouncer at the front of a club. And I put different covers onto a book of the same dimensions on the shelf. Elan Lee: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: I guess I didn’t tell you this. Under the new nonfiction. Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And I just, during the peak hours over a couple of days, I just tracked the number of times it got picked up. Elan Lee: Oh, that’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And then I used that to determine which cover to use. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. Tim Ferriss: Now there are better or certainly easier tools to use. So we ended up, there are a number of them, I’ll just mention a few. So we used PickFu, P-I-C-K-F-U.com. There’s also Intellivy, I-N-T-E-L-L-I-V-Y, and then there’s another one called Stickybeak also. But these allow you to do roughly the same thing, which is you can take, for instance, with this box design or any type of art, or you could probably do it with copy, many different things. You can survey people who fit a particular demographic. And so you could identify whatever the ages, the gender, if they are members of a particular service, whether they have Prime membership or this membership or that membership. You can fine slice it however you want, and then you can serve up variants. So for this coyote who you see on the cover, I’ll explain for the people, basically the box looks like a slightly enlarged box for a deck of cards and then the top of the box is this beautiful autumnal orange, almost a saffron, like Buddhist robe. Elan Lee: We spent so much time on this color. Tim Ferriss: We spent so much time on this, it is impossible to overstate how much time I spent on this and everybody spent on it. Then there’s this beautiful lime green. I remember taking photographs of particular leaves at particular times of the year with light coming through it to identify the hexadecimal or Pantone numbers for this particular grain. Elan Lee: Oh, I remember this well, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you remember it, you remember it. And then looking at color theory and the color wheel and, oh, my God, it went on and on. But above the coyote which is in the center of the box, there is this upper portion of a cartoon coyote’s head and very much trickster. Where it ended up is there’s a little hat on the coyote, there’s an earring, there’s a wink and the snout is where it’s cut off so you don’t see the nose. And this was originally, I remember sketching this initially on a Zoom call by pen and paper and then holding it up to the Zoom call to the camera and then later sending the scan and then we worked from there. But we had variants with no hat, we had variants with no earring, we had variants with both eyes open looking to camera, so to speak, we had both eyes open looking in one direction off to the side and we were able to very quickly get a very good statistical signal on what people preferred. Elan Lee: Yes. However — Tim Ferriss: However. Elan Lee: — to your credit, when you showed me that character, I think, initially, both the coyote’s eyes were open and we had some questions about the hat and I remember asking you all these questions. “What do you think of a wink? What do you think of an earring? What do you think of a hat? What do you think of one eye closed? With both eyes closed? What do you think? What do you think?” And to your credit, your answer was always “Let’s test it. I don’t want to have an opinion about this, I do have an opinion but I don’t even want to tell you, let’s test it.” And that is such an intelligent way to approach this. And ultimately, this beautiful character that we ended up with was so clearly the winner, it wasn’t even close. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it wasn’t even close. And so we were able to get this very strong signal from thousands of people voting and, boom, here we are. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, we were talking about the road to retail. So it’s 70 percent of your sales are in-person retail versus online. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. Tim Ferriss: And, therefore, the stakes are high for these line reviews. Elan Lee: Yeah, line reviews are a big deal. And I remember, so we really wanted to all show up in person. I remember you were trying so hard to get — our first line review was with Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas. I remember you wanted so badly to be there and there was some scheduling conflict that just wasn’t going to let it happen. And we tried to change the date but, again, they’ve got so many meetings and you’ve got to get in in exactly this time and they couldn’t change it to anything appropriate. And I remember thinking, “Oh, we’re sunk, I don’t know how to sell this game without Tim there in the room showing how much passion he has.” And you had a great solve, you just recorded a video of all that passion and you sat down in front of the camera and you just riffed on the game. You were just like, “Here’s why I love this, here’s why this is important to me, here’s why I made this game, first time I put my name on a thing,” and you recorded this beautiful and passionate video. And I remember walking into the line review and sitting down and saying, “I have a new game. First thing I’m going to do is we’re going to play this game and I’m not going to tell you anything about it, we’re just going to play this game.” And I set up the game and, within five minutes, they’re laughing and they’re having this incredible time and they’re like, “Oh, this is amazing, this is so much fun. How are you going to sell this thing?” And I said, “I’m going to play a video for you now,” and that was it. It was that one-two punch. It was we’ve nailed game design and we’ve nailed the pitch, we know exactly who to talk to and how to talk to them. And they saw those two elements and they’re full line purchase, every single store is getting this game. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild, yeah. Elan Lee: That has never happened on an initial pitch for us ever. Normally, we get into a subset of stores and then, eventually, it rolls out to all the stores. This was the first time ever they said, “Whatever it takes, we need this game everywhere.” Tim Ferriss: Which is still very surreal for me and I’m so grateful, obviously, and it’s terrifying at the same time. Not going to lie, this is mister dip the toe, then one foot, then wade up to the ankles, this is just — Elan Lee: Yeah, fire hose on. Tim Ferriss: — full Monty from second zero. What are other keys to pitching in a line review? And that could also be, I’ll just offer another option, which is what are some common mistakes that people make or that you suspect people make? Elan Lee: Okay. So, the first most common mistake — Tim Ferriss: Because this could be for games but it could be for — Elan Lee: It’s for anything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — cosmetics, it could be for anything. Elan Lee: For anything. The first question is how are you represented in that room? Remember I said they only take a certain number of meetings, it took us five years to get one of those meetings. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: And the way that you get the — Tim Ferriss: Even with the thunderous, crazy lightning-in-a-bottle success of Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: They only have so many hours. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Yeah. So what you have to do instead is you find someone who already has a meeting and you hire them as your publisher and then they represent your game in their meeting. That’s how most companies do it and that’s how we did it for years. So the first problem is you have to make sure that whoever’s representing you, assuming you can’t be in the room because 99.9 percent of the people can’t, they are representing you the right way. With enough attention, they’re pitching it the right way, they’re representing it the right way, they’re saying the right words, they’re conveying the right fun. Tim Ferriss: How do you ensure that? Elan Lee: It’s a personal relationship and you — It’s just hard, it’s really hard. And to be honest, I don’t want to name names, but we went through three different publishers and I wasn’t happy with how — Tim Ferriss: How did you, this may or may not be something you can talk about, but how did you craft the deal structure such that you could take a swing and then you’re like, “Okay, swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else. And then swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How are those deals structured? Elan Lee: We got very lucky. Because our Kickstarter campaign was so through the roof, that fed into our Amazon sales immediately. And so I could go from publisher to publisher saying, “Look how many games I sold the last week, look how many I sold the week before that. This is a prestigious title that you want to represent.” And then when they wouldn’t represent me properly, wouldn’t get the right sales, couldn’t get the right deal structure in place because we also demand quite a bit as far as where the game is placed, is it in aisle, is it out of aisle, meaning is it in the game section or somewhere else. Tim Ferriss: Ankle height versus eye height. Elan Lee: Exactly, right. Those bottom shelves are like a death sentence, nobody looks down there. Can we get games at checkout where they’re selling chewing gum, can we put games there? Can we get games in the catalog? All this stuff that I wanted for our games was just not being properly represented for us. So, eventually, after our sales got high enough, I finally was able to stop doing that silly dance with these publishers and we were able to publish our own games. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. So, if I’m hearing you correctly, the success of the direct to consumer, the DTC, Kickstarter, Amazon, I should say online, those successes allowed you to dictate certain deal terms with the publishers so you had flexibility. Elan Lee: Correct. And they allow us to say you want to represent us. Because, even then, they only have a one, maybe two-hour meeting and so there’s only so many games they can pitch so how do they fill that library. Tim Ferriss: And then you get to the point where you can go and book those meetings yourself. How important was having a critical mass of SKUs? Elan Lee: Oh, it’s everything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because I have to imagine, if I’m a major retailer, I don’t want to have a meeting with someone who only has one thing to sell. Elan Lee: Well, that’s why we couldn’t do it at first. It was only once we had, I think, 10 games was the magic number to make it worth their while. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Yeah. And that takes a long time. And it’s not just 10 games, it’s 10 bestsellers. And unless you’re there, they’re just like, “Yeah, just go through a publisher. We don’t have time for — “ Tim Ferriss: Don’t have time. Elan Lee: We take 10 meetings, we don’t have time for an 11th. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. All right, so what have you learned understanding but, to the extent possible, if we can put aside the element of Exploding Kittens having and developing this incredible track record which allows you to not cut corners in a bad way but you can go in without a finished prototype of the box, et cetera. If we put that aside for the moment, what have you learned about line reviews if you look at your first outing versus — Elan Lee: Yeah. Oh, I love this. Tim Ferriss: — the more refined line reviews? Elan Lee: Yeah, okay. Tim Ferriss: And I’m spending a lot of time on this, guys, because this applies to everything. It applies to so much. You have a movie? Okay, fine, how are people going to see the movie? Yeah, you can go direct but you might want a distribution partner. What we’re talking about will apply to that pitch meeting, a lot of it. And it’s the stuff that mainstream magic is made of is figuring out how to craft these meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Remember you said, “Like it or not, you’re in sales?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Here it is. This is where the rubber meets the road. Dust off your tap dancing shoes because, holy crap, these are tough. So you have to walk into that meeting and first you have to keep in mind you are their 10th meeting. Even if you’re not their 10th meeting, you’re their 10th meeting. They’re in this “I’m tired, I want to get out of this room, I’ve been at this for too long,” they’re in that mindset. So the first thing you’ve got to do is get them out of that funk. You need them to understand that this is going to be the best of the 10 meetings. And you do that with enthusiasm, you do that with props, you do that with a cool video. The stuff that can get them out of, “Oh, this isn’t like the other meetings.” Cool, that’s where you start. So we walk into the room with two of those suitcases, not the ones that fit in the overhead, the big crazy ones you have to check and they’re filled with games, the most beautiful games we’ve got. Even stuff that we’re not pitching that day, even stuff we know will never see the light of day because we’re going to set all of those up. And the basic premise is buy into this world. Exploding Kittens is not a product, it’s a whole world and you can have this world on your store shelves. And so that’s how we start and that’s a really nice way to start. Okay. Then what they’re expecting is, “Okay, pitch us a game one at a time. Pitch this, okay, you’re done. Okay, pitch the next one. Okay, you’re done. Pitch the next one.” What we do is very different. Instead of pitching a game and then pitching the next one, just like I said, for Coyote, we’re like, “Hey, we’re going to play a game.” And usually they say, “We don’t have time to play, can you just pitch it?” And I say, “No, we’re going to play a game.” Confrontation, I get it, but I force them to play the games, every single one of them. Now, I’m not going to play all the way through, I’m not going to spend 10 or 20 minutes. Tim Ferriss: All right. This might seem like a trivial detail but I don’t think it is. You in a tuxedo and a top hat for this? Are you dressed in your Sunday’s finest? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Oh, it’s so funny. So I learned this in my Microsoft days. If I dress up, if I wear a tuxedo, if I wear a suit, if I even wear a button-up shirt, nobody takes me seriously because I’m supposed to be the creative guy. I have to wear the creative guy uniform, I have to wear a t-shirt, I have to wear jeans, otherwise, no one looks at me. So that’s how I show up. Luckily, it’s a really comfortable uniform for me. So I force them to play and I’m there being the game’s biggest cheerleader. I don’t usually let them win, but I usually orchestrate a scenario in the game where they’re having as much fun as possible. And my goal is for them to have exactly those emotions that we talked about. When we start, I need them to think I can do that. And then, a minute in, I need them to think, “Oh, I did that. What’s next? Oh, I can do that next thing too.” And I am just crafting that. And right at the point where they’re like, “Oh, I know what the next thing is,” I pull the game away. We’re done playing, now let me tell you how we’re going to sell this game. And it’s because, at that point, they’re drooling. And I do that 10 times in a meeting and we just keep hitting that over and over. And I am very aware that the last two games I pitch are usually not going to be purchased because they’re exhausted because that roller coaster — they’ve been up and down too many times. Tim Ferriss: Right. So, you’re going to have to figure out the sequence. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Do you start with the game you hope is going to be the big purchase? How do you sequence it? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. We open with our shortest, easiest pitch and what that usually is an Exploding Kittens expansion. So, if I need to sell an expansion box or a new Exploding Kittens product and I know I don’t have to work very hard to sell it because they always sell, that’ll take the first spot. That just warms the waters, gets us all eased in. Tim Ferriss: A little yes momentum. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t hurt. Elan Lee: Yeah. The number two spot is the glory spot. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Whoever is there, that’s the game I’m actually pitching today. That’s where Coyote was, that’s the big thing we’re going to talk about. And then the next five are equal, it doesn’t matter what order they are, those are — usually we’ll sell all five of those. At a typical meeting, all five. What happens after that is very iffy. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Now you mentioned you play the game, you get them super excited, hopefully, they’re drooling over it and then you say, “All right, I’m going to take the game away, here’s how we’re going to sell it.” What is included in the “Here’s how we’re going to sell it?” Elan Lee: Oh, yeah, okay. So important. So this has changed over the last three years. It used to be I have to start with the box and we still — I shouldn’t say it used to be, it still is, we start with the box. “Look how beautiful this thing is,” and we do a mock-up, here’s how it looks on the shelf and it’s usually from a photograph we took that morning. We want to show you, “Hey, Target, here’s what your shelf looks like. Hey, Walmart, here’s what your shelf looks like. Here is our game right there in line.” Tim Ferriss: And I should mention, this probably goes without saying, but you are not just showing up and winging it, you guys — Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: — rehearse like you are going to be performing once in a lifetime at Carnegie Hall. Elan Lee: It is, if we screw up this meeting, our company is screwed. We don’t survive a bad meeting so, yeah, there is nothing that matters more than this. This is, arguably, 70 percent of our business this year. If we mess up this meeting, we will see a 70 percent drop. If they bought zero games, I don’t know that our company would survive that, so it’s a big deal. We rehearse constantly, we make changes constantly, we make all these props. We try to get the spot either right after breakfast or right after lunch because that’s when they’re in the best moods. All of it is orchestrated and so carefully. Who’s in the meeting? How many chairs are we going to fill? Tim Ferriss: How do you request those time slots? Because I imagine you’re not the only people who are thinking about this, right? It makes me think of the data, it’s a meta-analysis long ago looking at judges’ verdicts before or after meals and leniency, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, right. So, how do you get the right slots, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, how do you angle for those? Elan Lee: There’s an art to that as well. So we have agents, we have representatives, one for Target and one for Walmart, and these are people who live in those cities, and they live and breathe sales with the sales rep. So, their job is — the very cynical way to say it is they’re like lobbyists but the more — Tim Ferriss: Ambassadors. Elan Lee: Ambassadors, there we go. That’s a much more appropriate way. They have been doing the job for longer than the salespeople have, longer than the buyers have. And as a result, the relationship that they have with the buyers is actually one of education because they’ve seen all the mistakes, they know where all the landmines are, they know how to avoid them. And so part of the art of getting the best meetings, of getting yourself set up the best, is to hire the best agent. Tim Ferriss: How does someone find said agents? Elan Lee: Friends of friends of friends. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: The best ones already have too many clients. You can’t work with them. Tim Ferriss: Right, the usual situation. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. But if you have a good enough brand, if you have the right relationships, if you can talk to the right people and if you’re persistent, you can get the right agents. I actually thought we didn’t need an agent at all at first. I was like, “We can just do it, we’re going to show up the day before, we’re going to walk into these meetings,” and some very good friends of mine in the industry said, “You are an idiot, it’s just not going to work.” So we started working with agents and they’re incredible. They know the industry, they can — Tim Ferriss: Now, just to dig into that a little, why wouldn’t that work? Is it that the code of etiquette and the way everything has been set up involves those agents and, therefore, it wouldn’t work or are there other reasons why going in guns blazing without representation wouldn’t work? Elan Lee: Yeah, both. The answer is both. So the buyers are much less likely to take you seriously unless you have an agent in the room. And part of that is just because — Tim Ferriss: I guess part of it is just these fools don’t know how this is done. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Right. They’re showing up to Downton Abbey wearing a tank top. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And they don’t know how to use the silverware. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Why should I trust their ability to be a good partner and actually get things done on time if they haven’t done their homework? Elan Lee: Precisely. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: And the other half is you haven’t done your homework. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You actually don’t know, you actually don’t know how to use the silverware. When we walk into a meeting, the agent has done a year’s worth of work prepping for that meeting. They have made sure the buyers know what you’re going to pitch, how many games you’re going to pitch, what the order of the games is. They’ve made sure that the sales for the previous purchases they’ve made going into the meeting so they already have the confidence in, yes, these people are going to deliver. They’ve made sure that inventory levels are where they need to be so that a meeting doesn’t get sidetracked by them saying “This game is sold out, how did you let that happen?” So many things can go wrong that the agent is fixing before they go wrong so that the meeting stays on the rails and gets you to success. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: It’s a full-time job and, without it — Tim Ferriss: And so that agent is the person who lobbies for the appointment after breakfast for lunch? Elan Lee: Exactly, yes. But you have to know to ask for it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, right. Elan Lee: Because your agent has other clients. They’re going to sit through maybe three, sometimes four meetings in that sell cycle and they’re going to give that prime slot to the one who asks for it. So you’ve got to know to ask for it. Here I am telling you on this podcast, it’s probably going to make my job a little bit harder for the next sales round, but so be it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. People listening need to hop through a few hoops before — Elan Lee: Yeah, fair enough, all right. Tim Ferriss: — they end up being viable competition. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. There’s a few other tricks that — Tim Ferriss: And we are going to come back to, if you’re just developing a game at your kitchen table, what are some of the first steps. So, we’re going to get to that. Elan Lee: Yeah, we’ll get there. Yeah, for sure. Tim Ferriss: But in the meantime, you said a couple of tricks of the trade? Elan Lee: Yeah, there’s a few more. I should be a little careful about what I say but, look — Tim Ferriss: We can always bleep things in edit later. Elan Lee: All right. So, you want to pay attention to, believe it or not, all of the retailers have color themes year by year. So you want to make sure that, when you walk into a meeting, your boxes match that color scheme, it makes it much easier for them to say yes. Tim Ferriss: Had no idea. Elan Lee: Yeah, right, I know. Because why would you? Because why would anybody, right? There’s things like those agents are given permission to read the notes from the all-hands meeting from the company so they know what the company’s priorities are. And so you want to sit down with your agent in advance and say, “Those buyers, what are they going to get promotions and raises based on this year? Is it more throughput at the store? Is it promote online sales? Is it match the color scheme?” Whatever it is, you want to make sure — Tim Ferriss: What are the incentives? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you want to make sure that, when they look at your games, they think, “Oh, I’m really trying to promote online sales this year, whoa, this game would do great on our website. And then the next game, this game would do great on our website as well.” And by the time you get to the end of the meeting they’re like, “Oh, my God, I can get a promotion if I just buy all 10 of these games.” That’s what you want them to walk away with. Tim Ferriss: All right. So, these meetings are huge, we’ve established this. A huge deal. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned a couple of tricks to the trade. And any other tips, tricks, learnings along the way? Elan Lee: So what happens after those meetings is also very important. Okay. So there’s two things we have to talk about. One is pricing structure and the other is marketing. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: So in the meeting you talk a little bit about both. You have to now include marketing. Remember I said three years ago things were different than today? Three years ago, the marketing plan that you show for your game is largely your own website. Maybe you’ve bought some TV commercials, things like billboards, product placement here and there, things like that. Today, none of that matters. All they care about is social media because that’s the only form of marketing for games that works anymore, so. Tim Ferriss: I should say also it particularly works on, and this is my understanding, on platforms like TikTok or now that other platforms have realized to avoid TikTok consuming their market share, they need to push and reward short-form video. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Short-form video. Casual games are perfectly suited to short-form video. Elan Lee: Yeah. And the way that you build the most effective videos for those is you need to inspire, I think, two emotions. One, “I understand what those people are experiencing right now,” And two, “I would like to experience that.” And it took me forever to get to those two sentences. At first it was, “Let’s show gameplay, let’s show setup, let’s show a memorable moment. Let’s show people screaming and yelling because they’re having so much fun.” None of that matters. None of that works. “That looks like fun. I could have that much fun.” That’s it. That’s what you’re trying to show. Tim Ferriss: How does that differ from the first? Elan Lee: Um, it’s very, very focused, you want to — remember we talked about mastery early on? Tim Ferriss: Well, I also asked you guys, because we were talking about this very early on in the process, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Also, because if I’m procrastinating doing something hard, I like to talk about the marketing because it just is a lot easier for me to talk about. But I wanted to see examples of videos that had worked for any of your games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Social posts. And so they were sent over. I was like, “Okay, I think I can deduce why this works.” Often it was one person playing the other person struggling to guess what the other person was doing and one person losing it laughing. Just inconsolably, but in the best possible way, losing it, getting the giggles out of control. Elan Lee: Okay. So I’ll tell you, one of the most effective pieces of media we have ever used was for Poetry for Neanderthals. This has like at this point, I don’t know, tens of millions of views. And all it is — oh, sorry, “Here’s how you play Poetry for Neanderthals. I have to get you, I have a secret word on this card. I have to get you to say that word. And I can only speak using single syllable words. That’s the whole game. If I mess up, someone sitting next to me has a giant inflatable neanderthal club and they get to bonk me on the head.” All right. So there’s our whole game. The best video we’ve ever seen is someone who’s trying to get a person to say the word “garage.” And we know they’re trying to get the person to say the word garage because we put that right on the screen. We show you, “Here’s the secret word, it’s garage.” And they’re just saying, “Car, go here. Car, hole, car hole. This car hole, big car hole.” And everyone’s losing it. And the poor person trying to guess is like, “What the fuck is a car hole? Glove compartment? What are you trying to say?” And then they say, “Vehicle. Multiple syllable word.” And so they get bonked on the head. Okay, here’s why that video is so effective. It’s those two senses. One is, “I see the experience they’re having. I get that.” And the secondary corollary is “I could do better than that.” Tim Ferriss: Is this the video, I think I remember seeing this. This might have been a separate video, but there’s a woman who’s the poet and then there’s the guy next to her, holding the club. Elan Lee: Yeah, so menacing. Tim Ferriss: The ax is going to drop. Yeah. And everyone’s losing it, including the guy at the back. Elan Lee: Because you look at that and you say, “I understand the rules,” immediately. “I understand the experience they’re having. I would like to have that experience.” And that’s what makes for an effective social media video. Tim Ferriss: All right, so how do you pitch that? Elan Lee: Well, we show a lot of examples and we show a track record. We say, “Look, here’s how many views our last round of videos got. Here’s how many likes, here’s how many shares, here’s how many subscriptions.” All this stuff, we show them right there in the meeting. We never had to do that. This is a brand new phenomenon. And we say, “Here’s the type of video that we’re going to craft for this new game,” and we always couch it in those two sentences. “Here’s how we’re going to explain the fun people are having and here’s how we’re going to make the audience feel like they would like to have that much fun as well.” And that’s been very effective for us. So that’s now half the meeting, because every game we start by, I demo the game. Tim Ferriss: It’s social media strategy. Elan Lee: Yes. I demo the game, I pull the game back, we talk a little bit about the pricing structure and the theme and the box and all that. And then we go right into social media strategy for that game. Because I have to spend as much time on that as I did on the game design because they’re equally important now. It’s huge. Such a difference. Tim Ferriss: All right, so for somebody listening who is thinking about making a game, and I really encourage everyone to do that, and I’m just going to flash, this is as good a time as any, just to flash these blank cards that are within every Coyote box and they are color-coded. You can use these to make action cards, which are these different gestures and actions and so on. Elan Lee: Yeah. Those are the templates that we use. Tim Ferriss: These are the templates. You can use them to make Coyote cards, these modifiers. You can use them to make the attack cards which you use to sabotage other people. There are other ways to play those cards. This is intended to invite everyone to basically create their own game by modifying the rules. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Or adding new elements that are uniquely their own. You can have fun with your friends, you can have fun with your kids. I mean, this is intended to make you a part of the creative process, which you will be part of anyway, just by the way you play the game but this takes it to another level. And this was a really important element for me. So this will be a warm-up in a sense. You get to try game design, game development light, with these blank cards. But let’s say somebody then decides they want to give it a go, maybe it’s with one of their kids, like you did with your daughter. Maybe it’s by themselves. Who knows? Maybe it’s going to the game shop, local game shop, which I really recommend people do. If you’ve never been to a real proper game shop, go in on a game night when people are set up and also check out the games you might not be inclined to check out. So if you’re a casual gamer, go to a Warhammer night, see what that’s about. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Check out these different worlds. Elan Lee: Another secret weapon is go to a game shop, find the owner, or even the person behind the counter, someone who knows what they’re talking about. And just say, “I’m looking for a game. What game do you wish more people would give a try?” And you’ll find the gems that way because they know. But maybe the game doesn’t have the best box or the best name or it fell short somewhere and people just aren’t buying it, but they know it’s amazing. That’s where you find them. It’s a great experience. Tim Ferriss: So start testing the waters in that way. It’s so easy to do in a place like Austin. I mean, this is Austin. People might think of game locations and X, Y, Z, they’re all over the place. There happens to be a really vibrant scene here. And if you wanted to, if one wanted to start developing their own game, let’s say they find something that starts to stick. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ve got a tiger by the tail. This seems to be working. They’re play testing. It might take a while, like Settlers of Catan, I think Klaus Teuber had 150 versions before, that’s a complex game. But let’s say they start to develop the game and they’re like, “All right, I would like to try to sell this.” What are the options? What would you say to someone who’s like, they’re smart, they can plan, they’ve operated in the world before, so they’re not new to adulting, but they have no experience in selling games. Elan Lee: There are three paths. I’ll tell you all three paths and then I’ll tell you my favorite one. Tim Ferriss: All right. Elan Lee: Okay. Path number one, self-publishing. Self-publishing is hard, but you can print out your own decks. You can design everything yourself. You can write the rules yourself. You can do absolutely everything yourself. And then you can spend a few thousand dollars, publish a few hundred copies, and send them out to all your friends. Okay. So that’s option one. It sucks. Don’t do that one. It’s just the worst. I mean, you’re just going to make every mistake and you’re not — Tim Ferriss: And you’re going to have to pay for your mistakes. Elan Lee: And you pay for every mistake, and then once you make the mistake, now you can’t take it back and you can’t undo it. Just don’t self-publish. It’s a terrible idea. Okay, there’s number one. That’s not my favorite one. Number two is you go to an existing publisher, Hasbro, Mattel, nowadays Exploding Kittens. You can approach big publishers, pitch your game, and then strike a deal with them where they will handle all the risk, but they will also take most of the reward. You can still honestly get very rich this way, but you have to get into their portfolio, so either you need a track record or you just have to absolutely wow them or you need some other — you have to show up with some bona fides. You can’t just say, “I’m a brand new designer, here’s my brand new game, please publish me.” Tim Ferriss: How would you, maybe there are exceptions where people have wowed them, first time game designer with a game, how does one do that? Elan Lee: You go to a convention. Tim Ferriss: You go to a convention? Elan Lee: Yeah, you go to a convention, you demo your game, they will all show up. They’re like agents recruiting for a sports team. They’re going to show up to all of those places and they’re going to walk the halls and they’re going to check even the smallest booths. And they’re going to even go to the big convention halls where everyone just has their own little folding table or even a temporary folding table. They’re going to look at all of that stuff. So it is possible to do it that way, but you have to keep in mind they have very few slots open and they usually only have one or two agents, scouts looking for games. So your chances of success there are low as a first-time person, much better if you can walk in, if you can schedule a meeting and they will take that meeting and then you can say, “Here’s why you should not say no to this.” Tim Ferriss: What are the things you can do or put in a pitch that increase the likelihood of getting a meeting, outside of being an influencer with 20 million followers on Instagram? Elan Lee: Well, yeah, that helps, but the reason that helps is, what I was going to say is the ability to sell the game, whatever it is, maybe you’re an influencer — Tim Ferriss: By the way, also true of nonfiction writing. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: If you’re selling a book. Elan Lee: And for selling a screenplay and for really selling anything, you need to be able to say, “Here’s why people are going to take notice of this thing and why you would be a fool to pass on this opportunity.” That’s hard. Oftentimes the best way to do that is to have already done it, which means your first time out, you need what I’m about to talk about, which is option three. Option three, crowdfunding. This is relatively new, like 10, 15 years old. Tim Ferriss: So it is, I guess, self-publishing in a sense, but you’re getting other people to fund the development. Elan Lee: Two things, yes to that. Exactly right. Other people are funding a hundred percent of the development, which is incredible. But also you are collecting those funds on a platform that promotes the game. People are there watching your video, you’re trying to convince them. Tim Ferriss: It is a discovery platform. Elan Lee: Exactly. Perfectly phrased. It is a discovery platform that was missing 15 years ago. “Watch my self-published YouTube video and hopefully fund my game,” it just didn’t exist. So now people are looking at crowdfunding sites looking for cool new experiences and backing them. And that’s a new invention and that’s really cool. And it’s not my favorite one either. So I just said I picked my favorite and I just pitched three and I said, “None of them are my favorite.” Here’s my actual favorite. A combination of two and three. Start on crowdfunding, especially if it’s your first time out. Learn everything you can. Your first project is probably going to fail. That’s okay. You’ve got nothing at stake. You didn’t lose anything. Fix it. Relaunch it, fix it again. Relaunch it again. Take as many times as you need. There’s nothing at risk here. You’re just learning the process. Awesome. When you get a success on whatever crowdfunding platform you love, now go to those publishers and say, “Here are my bona fides. Here’s proof that this thing is going to sell. I’ve already sold this once. I’ve already gotten 10.” Tim Ferriss: Do you do that before you have shipped the game? Elan Lee: No. Very important. No. Ship the game first. If the only thing you can prove is that you are a train wreck waiting to happen, you will get nothing from them. So ship the game, show that you’re organized, even if it’s a small fulfillment like you sell a hundred copies of your game, show that you can fulfill those hundred copies and then start to show the reactions to those. If you’ve only got a hundred people who bought the game, reach out to every single one of them and beg them to record a video about how much they love your game. And now go to publishers with that. That’s really what you’re searching for. Use crowdfunding as exactly what it is, as a way to launch your new game to then take to step two. Tim Ferriss: Let me ask this. There may be people listening or watching who think to themselves, “That sounds awesome, but wasn’t the heyday of crowdfunding three, four, or five years ago?” Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: You hear less about it. Certainly for, let’s say, selling to a hundred people or maybe many, many more, I’m sure there are runaway success campaigns even today, but are there any tweaks that you would add to it? Elan Lee: It’s really tricky. Okay, so here’s what happened with crowdfunding. So we launched on Kickstarter, Exploding Kittens launched on Kickstarter, and by some amazing twist of fate, that was perfect timing. Very few people had heard of Kickstarter. They heard about this funny, silly thing. It was drawn by The Oatmeal. Matt already had this incredibly large audience and people showed up and they said, “Ooh, crowdfunding. Ooh, this thing costs 20 bucks. I’m going to back this thing.” And we had 219,000 people try that thing. Amazing. Unheard of success. Those people then over the next, let’s call it five years, stayed on Kickstarter and they backed other things, other games, other projects, whatever. And what they found was the nature of Kickstarter is such that only about 50 percent of those projects that shipped either the thing that shipped was nowhere close to the thing promised, or the thing never shipped, and they never got their money back. Whatever it is. Tim Ferriss: People got burned. Elan Lee: They got burned, and they had a terrible experience. And now when you say, “Hey, back my Kickstarter,” everyone’s got this memory implanted of, “Oh, that was a bad experience for me. Maybe I even had some great experiences, but I also had those bad ones and this is not worth it. And I’m not going back to that site or any crowdfunding site.” So that’s the problem. We’re not seeing the numbers we used to see because everyone’s walking in with this baggage and it sucks. My only advice is there is now a secondary ecosystem around Kickstarter, other websites that have gotten very good at promoting projects, that have gotten very good at advertising new offerings on Kickstarter and building trust, like if you get on this other — Tim Ferriss: So it’s like a curated site that vets projects. Elan Lee: Exactly right. And here’s the thing, those companies almost always take a percentage of what the maker gets in exchange for helping them with fulfillment, with creation, with everything. So not only are you buying into a trusted ecosystem, but you also know there’s multiple parties involved that are going to work very hard to make sure you get that product. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those companies? Elan Lee: I would have to look them up. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Yeah, no problem. All right, we’ll put maybe links to a few of them in the show notes. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s a ton of them. They all have the word backer in them somewhere, backer found and backer this and backer that. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ll put a couple of links in the show notes. Tim.blog/podcast, you can find it. And I will also just give a shout-out to a friend of mine who at some point you have to meet, maybe you’ve met him already. Craig Mod, does that name ring at all? Elan Lee: No. I don’t know Craig. Tim Ferriss: All right, so Craig is a gem of a human, amazing writer, also very technical as a software engineer, software development expert. And he, at one point, for his beautiful books that he has bound and crafted in Japan, these are works of art, they’re absolutely beautiful. And he created basically a, I don’t know if open source is the right term, but he does have the code available on GitHub for anybody who wants it, called, I think it’s called Craigstarter, which is effectively, if you want to host your own crowdfunding campaign and in his opinion, fix some of the bugs that were difficult to contend with. Elan Lee: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: Then boom, you can do that. Elan Lee: Oh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: And I think he incorporated Shopify and other add-ons, different services could be as modules. I’m sure I’m not using the right terminology, but incorporated into it. Elan Lee: Super clever. I love it. Tim Ferriss: So people can also check that out. And I have two interviews with Craig. You should check out both of them. They’re absolutely fantastic. Elan Lee: Lovely. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so folks can look at these services as basically a stamp of credibility. They will help not only with the promotion if you are so vetted, but with the fulfillment, like that third-party logistics. Elan Lee: That’s right. Now, I don’t think we’re going to see a crowdfunding campaign on the scale of Exploding Kittens these days. There are a few exceptions. You just interviewed one of them, in fact. Tim Ferriss: Brandon Sanderson? Elan Lee: Exactly, out of control success. Tim Ferriss: $45 million, or whatever it was, Kickstarter campaign for fantasy books. Unheard of. Elan Lee: Bonkers. Unheard of. But what I love is that that shows this is not even a remotely dead platform. Tim Ferriss: No. Elan Lee: There is success to be had here. You just have to be creative. I mean he started out with a great fan base. He picked an incredible title, the first word of his campaign was, “Surprise.” No one’s done that before. What does that mean? And just everything about it. Smart on top of smart on top of smart. I loved it. Loved it. So it’s very possible, but it’s also very rare and you have to be smart about it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, here’s the thing. It’s possible and who cares? It may not have the gravitational pull that it had five years ago, but if you can’t sell anything in a crowdfunding campaign, you are not going to sell any buyer at mass retail. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: It’s not going to happen. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And therefore you save yourself years of banging your head against a brick wall when you’re never going to break through. If you get, and this might not sound like good news, but if it’s going to fail, you want to fail as quickly as possible. Elan Lee: It’s great news, as long as you don’t take it personally, as long as you say “This product — “ Tim Ferriss: How many games do you guys screw around with on any level? And how many make the cut? Elan Lee: We probably work on a hundred games a year and less than 20 make the cut. Tim Ferriss: And that’s with all of your experience? Elan Lee: Yeah. That’s probably way higher than it should be. I’m probably pushing forward games that have no right to be pushed forward. But again, you don’t take it personally. You say, “This game is flawed.” And the faster you can figure that out, the faster you can move on to a game that isn’t flawed. Tim Ferriss: So if I heard you correctly then, it’s crowdfunding. You establish some numbers and so on that you can share that show traction at some type, game reactions, et cetera. Then you take all of that to book a meeting at a trade show or a conference or convention with one of these publishers who already has the annual meetings and line reviews. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And you make a pitch to do a deal with them. Elan Lee: That’s my favorite path through this. Tim Ferriss: What deal terms do you need to pay attention to? Elan Lee: Okay, so there is one very important number that you’re going to get, and it’s going to seem like a very low number, but here’s how this works. Most publishers are going to throw a number at you, like two percent. Tim Ferriss: Royalty rate? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you’re going to think, “Wait a second, I was the inventor, I get 80 percent and you’re offering me two percent?” But here’s what that number actually means. They, the publisher, are going to take on all the risk. They’re going to do all the printing, they’re going to do all the relationship management, they’re going to do that sales meeting, they’re supporting hundreds of people on their staff, they’re doing all this stuff that you are not doing. But in exchange for that, that two percent isn’t two percent of the profit, it’s two percent of the revenue. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Top line. Elan Lee: Exactly. And that is a very important distinction. That makes that two percent probably closer to 20 percent, 30 percent once you do all the math. Tim Ferriss: It’s the opposite of Hollywood accounting. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: It’s not some percentage of net income, which is defined in some Byzantine way to fuck you every which way from Sunday. Elan Lee: Precisely right. Tim Ferriss: If it’s top line — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So just to reiterate what you just said, two percent is more like 20 plus percent? Elan Lee: Yes, that’s exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Of profit? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you can ask them to break down that math for you. You can say, “Show me the spreadsheet, show me what you’re spending, what your responsibilities are, what mine are. After all of those numbers are crunched, what is the total amount you’re going to spend on this game? Show me your total projections on what’s coming in, show me how much I’m going to make of that.” And then you can start comparing those numbers yourself and see, “Oh, of the money that came in, I’m getting 20 percent of it. Even though this number only says two percent.” Once you crunch that math, this is a pretty decent deal. And you can get higher than two percent. Usually not as a first-time developer, but I’ve seen deals anywhere from two to 12 percent on the super high end. Tim Ferriss: 12, wow. Elan Lee: You’ve got to be a rockstar because at 12 percent, now you’re at 50 percent, and that’s tough to get to. You’ve got to really pull your weight to get numbers like that. So those are what the deals look like. And then after that, then the whole relationship moves into this like, “Okay, now what the hell are we actually making? What is the quality of the cards? What are the components in the box? Are you allowed to change rules?” Tim Ferriss: Quick question, is the deal structure similar to a book publishing contract in the sense that the game developer would get an advance against sales? Or is that — Elan Lee: Sometimes. Tim Ferriss: Sometimes? Elan Lee: Yeah. You can negotiate that. I’ve seen publishers do that or not do that. I will just say for Exploding Kittens, we never do advances. Tim Ferriss: It’s fundamentally different also from, say, nonfiction book publishing in the following sense. If you’re taking a, let’s call it conventional publishing approach, which is very similar to selling the game, it’s like you have an agent. You’ve got the editors, let’s just say, and the publishers who are the buyers of sorts, the editor might be the category buyer but they have to get the okay from the publisher for signing off on deals. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And you’ll have your royalty rate, which varies widely, but let’s just say somewhere depending on paperback versus hardcover, up to probably a maximum in conventional deals of 12 to 15 percent of cover, which is also, again, of cover. And then there’s the advance, but the critical difference that I was alluding to is typically when a nonfiction book is sold, you are selling a book proposal, which is a writing sample and a marketing plan. Elan Lee: Wow. Tim Ferriss: And if, and only if, a publisher decides to sign a contract and buy the book, do you get an advance to buy you the time so you can stop doing all of these other things to write the full book, whereas with the game, the game’s got to be ready. Elan Lee: It’s done. Yeah. Now let’s call it 90 percent done, to be fair. And usually when we take on games, we change them significantly just because there’s always a better version, and through testing, we discover it. But the reason we don’t do advances, partially, is exactly what you’re saying. You’re already done. We’re not trying to pull you off of other projects. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You don’t have to stop your nine to five. Elan Lee: Exactly. Exactly. But the other reason is because I want a partnership. I’m not here to say, “You sold us this game. Now we’re never going to talk again.” I want you here every day. I want skin in the game. We’re going to all make this better together, which is why we do so few partnerships. Tim Ferriss: Now, when you do partnerships, meaning you’re the publisher, you’re paying someone a royalty, how do you typically find those? So for instance, and I imagine a lot of it is you guys canvassing and basically asking the question that you recommended people ask the store owners, “Which game do you wish people played more often?” And then you find something that has the bones of a really good game but a piece of it is shitting the bed. There’s something that is broken and you’re like, “Oh, we can fix that broken thing.” Or do you take cold submissions? How does that work? Elan Lee: We have a form. We have a submission form on our website. We almost never find anything there. It’s hard. It’s time-consuming to go through all of them and honestly, it’s just not the highest quality. We also go to conventions. We look a little bit around there. Sometimes we find a diamond in the rough. Tim Ferriss: That’s a crowded fishing hole, right? Elan Lee: Very crowded. The most effective way are those agents. We talk to those two agents and we say, “Hey, people approach you all the time wanting you to be their agent and you have to turn a lot of them down. The ones that you feel terrible about because they’re such a good game and they just can’t get in the door, send them to us.” And that works really well. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Smart. That’s super smart. Aside from a crowdfunding campaign, what would actually cut through in a submission? Are there any ingredients outside of, here are a bunch of compelling data from a crowdfunding campaign? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Or, “Hey, I’ve designed a hundred hit games.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s that. Tim Ferriss: Aside from those two, what other types of lines or elements would cut through the noise? Elan Lee: So remember I said that phrase, the way we design games is we don’t make games that are entertaining, we make games that make the players entertaining. 90 percent of the game pitches I see are attempts to be entertaining games and I just immediately dismiss them. That looks like that game is working so hard to entertain the players. I don’t care. The best games, the ones that I pay very careful attention to, are when everything you do in the game creates an interaction between two players. I’m not interested in a four-player game where all four players are playing solitaire. It’s just, who cares? I’m interested in a game where the players are playing the players and I play a card — Tim Ferriss: We tweaked a lot in Coyote based on that. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So guiding principle. Elan Lee: And those are the best games. Those are the ones I love the most. Those are the ones I want to play over and over again. Tim Ferriss: And it could be as simple as you might, I’m saying you, the listener or viewer might remember holding your cards facing you versus having the cards available to the entire table. Elan Lee: That’s right. Because now we’re playing all together. And the card I choose, if I have a blind hand, if I have a deck of cards and I choose a card and then I play it, that is me presenting a game to the players. If I have all my available cards face up on the table and everyone can see what I choose, and everyone’s hoping I pick that first card, and I hover my hand over it and then I move to the second card instead and everyone starts groaning and then I play that second card anyway, now it’s me playing the players. And those are the best games in the world. Tim Ferriss: What are some common Achilles heels for games that have the potential to be great and huge successes? And I’m not going to mention names, but we’ve talked about a couple of games that you’ve considered buying or publishing, and I’m wondering what are some of the common weaknesses where you’re, this is a great game, but the reason it didn’t work is X or Y or Z. Elan Lee: All right, so there’s two basic places the games fall apart. One is right off the bat, their boxes suck, or the name sucks. The number of games out there called The Legendary Folklore of Gorgonzel. I can’t remember them, I don’t know what they are. I look at this — Tim Ferriss: Got to throw a CØCKPUNCH in there, and then it’s problem solved. Elan Lee: CØCKPUNCH aside, I would argue that those games, they have no chance of success. Yes, they’re going to sell 10 copies to the 10 people that bought The Legendary Tales of Gorgonzel volumes one through six, and they’re going to buy volume seven. Cool, great. I don’t care. Picking the wrong name, picking a non-descriptive name, putting a picture on the box that does not describe gameplay at all and does not provide a compelling narrative about what experience you are about to have, those games have zero chance of success. And I see that over and over and over again. You can fail right up front. And I’ve even seen the biggest publishers in the world mess this up, especially now that game shelves are so crowded and you don’t have five games to choose from, you have 500 games to choose from. And a game that doesn’t do a good job of saying, “Pick me, pick me, pick me,” you’re just not going to pick, so you will fail right there. Tim Ferriss: Or really complicated packaging too. I’ve seen that a bunch. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Where there’s just so much going on. There’s no one dominant element. It’s like, what am I supposed to look at here? Elan Lee: Yeah, what do you look at first? Tim Ferriss: So you can’t. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You don’t look at anything, you look at the next box. Elan Lee: It’s just noise. Just noise. We worked very hard on Coyote, on all our games, but I remember having this discussion about Coyote because this is such an important lesson. When you look at this box, we know the first thing you’re going to look at and we know the second thing you’re going to look at and we know the third thing you’re going to look at, and this is a formula, and we crafted this — Tim Ferriss: It’s a formula. Elan Lee: — very carefully. Tim Ferriss: By the way, also exactly what works in old school print advertising. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Header image, headline, subheading. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Text. Elan Lee: Yeah. And those components are all present here. Tim Ferriss: And if you fuck up the order, pardon my French, the eye doesn’t know how to track or it bounces around. Elan Lee: And if there’s other better options right next door, off you go. We hit those three things on a box meticulously, and your reaction should not be, “I’m going to buy that game.” That’s not our goal. Your reaction is, “I’m going to pick up this game and I’m going to turn it over and I’m going to read the back of the box.” And now we’ve got a very different task. Now we have more real estate we can afford. We still know the first thing you’re going to look at, but now we care a little bit less about the second thing. As long as you’ve already got enough interest, you’ve already committed to picking this thing up, now you’re willing to read a little story. As long as you can see the end of that story and you know it’s not too long, you’re going to read a little story. The goal of this is now purchase. I want you to get to the end of this experience and say, “I’ve got to have it. I want this.” Tim Ferriss: And just for people who can’t see this particular visual, and there’s all sorts of stuff on the back of the card, which we won’t get into, but some people might notice interesting things on the back of the cards. The dominant element on the back of the box is how to play. And man, we worked on this a lot too, with basically three panes, step one, step two, step three. “Put cards on the table, then take turns performing them,” that’s step one. And you’ve got a little visual with the salamander action cards. Then next part is “Play cards to help or sabotage other players,” shows two examples. Elan Lee: “Sabotage” was a very carefully chosen word, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Very carefully chosen. And then the last one is “Mess up and you’re out. The last player standing wins.” That’s for competitive mode. Now, one aspect of this that I think is very clever is not sure if you should buy this game? Give us a few seconds to convince you. And then there’s a QR code. Elan Lee: Nobody does that. This is new. Tim Ferriss: I know. What’s the impetus behind this? Elan Lee: This was an idea I had that we’re demoing on this game, first time ever. My idea was “If I went to the store with you, I could convince you to buy my favorite game because I’m going to pitch the hell out of that game.” But I’m not in the store with you, so that’s a problem. My first idea was for every retail location in the world, “Will they let us install a telephone that you can pick up and talk to somebody?” And they said, “No.” My second idea was, “Can I hire a person to stand in every store and convince you to buy the game I want you to buy?” And they said, “Sort of, but you have to pay for all of that.” And I was like, “Oh, that’s not going to work.” And so this was option three. Tim Ferriss: It’s cool, it’s a lot of people. 6,000 plus people. Elan Lee: I know, right? Can you imagine? This is just a little QR code. And the idea is I can’t stand next to you for every store, but I can tell you what I would’ve said had I been standing there. And so you scan this code and it’s just a 15-second video. In this case, it’s me, Tim, saying, “Listen, you’re holding a game in your hands. It’s the greatest thing you’ll ever see. Let me try to convince you.” And it’s just a pitch. It’s just, if I were standing next to you in the store, here’s why you should buy this game. And I don’t think a lot of people are going to scan that code, to be fair. But for those who do, they’re going to have the experience of a friend telling them, “You should trust me. This is going to be great, trust me.” Tim Ferriss: And it doesn’t take up that much real estate either. It’s an easy addition to the box. Once again, test it. Right. Let’s test it. Elan Lee: Test it. And what’s the worst that can happen? Tim Ferriss: See what happens. And I also want to revisit something you mentioned earlier, which is that royalty rate, whether it’s two percent, it’s up to 12 percent in the book world. Let me take the book world and the publishing world in the book publishing sense is changing a lot, but it’s also quite consistent over time. Different things have changed, sure, audio as a format has grown tremendously and become highly prized now versus 10 years ago when I could carve out those rights, it’s a lot harder to do now if you’re going to do the conventional route. But some folks will look at the percentages and they’ll say, “Well, wait a second, max 15 percent after an escalator, I’m starting off at 12 percent for hardcover. That’s ridiculous. I wrote the whole thing, da, da, da, da, da. I want to make the lion’s share.” There are some instances where you can make that work, but I will say just a few things. When you begin, for most people, unless you are excellent at running a meticulously managed business, it’s actually pretty tough to beat those numbers. In part because you’re going to be sacrificing distribution, so the top of the funnel number is going to be different. Secondly, when you factor in paying various agents, various distributors, and all of these little costs that for you, without any scale of having a thousand skews in a department dedicated to it, you start to very quickly approach that number. Elan Lee: Very quickly. Tim Ferriss: And by the way, you’re running a real business. This is not the easiest thing in the world to do at all. And I will probably do some experiments on that side of the equation in terms of “self-publishing,” which I would put in quotation marks because it’s going to be augmented pseudo self-publishing on a few levels. But I would only have the confidence of doing that myself currently, because I’ve gone through the conventional route multiple times and I’ve also run quite a few businesses. But if you’ve never, what Stephen Key, I mentioned earlier, one simple idea for licensing, what he might call venturing, running a business, do not underestimate the value of your time and sanity also. Elan Lee: It’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Because he’s, “Hey, look, I’ll take the licensing deal, maybe I’ll negotiate the number up a little bit.” But he’s like, “I can do 12 of those a year.” Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s exactly it. Tim Ferriss: And it adds up to a lot. And I have no employees, no supply chain issues. Elan Lee: No risk. Tim Ferriss: No, “Oops, that was printed the wrong way and now I have thousands of books —” Elan Lee: You have to recall those. Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: “— that are sitting in my garage unsold, gathering dust and mold.” Elan Lee: Let me tell you the simplest example of the difference between doing it yourself and getting help, valuing your time. Our very first game Exploding Kittens, I needed to put a barcode on the box because it has to sell in retail. I go, I’m like, I’m going to research this, this can’t be too hard. I do the research and I find this website and it’s, you’ve got to pay some little subscription, 100 bucks a year, whatever it is, and you can generate unlimited barcodes. Amazing. I generate a barcode, I put it on the box. That wasn’t so hard. Then Target’s like, “Well, this is the wrong format.” I’m like, “Okay.” I spend another 100 bucks, I get a different format bar, put it on. They’re like, “We need a different barcode based on the palette that it’s in.” And then I talk to Walmart and they’re like, “Yeah, we use a different barcode format and we need this barcode to represent whether it was picked up in China or Mexico or Poland, so you actually need three different ones. Oh, and by the way, if it’s bundled with other games, we need a fourth one. And by the way, if it ships into Arkansas, we need a fifth.” And I was just like, “Help. Oh, my God, help.” And that’s the difference. You should not get good at this. Why would you want to get good at that? Tim Ferriss: What’s funny is I was actually going to bring up the example of the UPC codes and the ISBN and all this stuff because I also went down that rabbit hole. I’m like, “How hard could it be?” Elan Lee: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: “Oh, this is easy.” And lo and behold, actually it’s a lot of brain damage. I’m not saying that no one should Venture in the sense of self-funding or self-publishing, but it is a lot harder and much more consuming than most people realize. Elan Lee: And there’s no reason, unless you want to do it for a living, there’s no reason to get good at it. There’s no upside there. Tim Ferriss: And do it for a living meaning handle those types of details. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Elan Lee: Anyway, we have a barcode person who does it for a living. She’s quite good. I’m so happy she’s on my team. Tim Ferriss: All right, so on the side of selling games, what else have we not touched on? Any other aspects? Elan Lee: Let’s see. Another thing I learned along the way is there’s two kinds of selling. One is everything we’ve been talking about today. And your expectation is, “I have sold you a game, the game is now your responsibility. And we’ve negotiated a price, you, the retailer, own this game now and you’re going to sell it.” The second kind is the kind that we actually engage in, which is you do own this game, but there are restrictions on how you can sell it. Tim Ferriss: Can you explain that again? When you say you own this game, you mean a retailer? Elan Lee: You, the retailer, have purchased this palette of games from me. Tim Ferriss: I get it. All right. Sorry, I was just clarifying because people might’ve heard that as you own the IP of the game. Elan Lee: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes. Tim Ferriss: You are buying an inventory of this game. Elan Lee: Correct. Now, what if the game doesn’t sell very well? Whose problem is that? Well, if you didn’t think that through and it’s just a straight sale, they can put it in a bargain bin or they can sell it to somebody else who’s then going to sell it. Or if you really didn’t negotiate it, they can force you to buy it back from them. The restrictions on what happens to the game, what they’re allowed to do post-sale is so meticulous and these contracts get so long. And this is another thing, you don’t want to get good at this. You just need to hire someone who has seen every imaginable mistake and knows what to argue for. And oftentimes the retailers don’t care that much about this part, especially because they have a lot of faith. This thing’s going to do well. But when it goes poorly, if it goes poorly, and we’ve had a few examples of this, what do you do next? In the case of something as simple as Amazon, Amazon has a terrible policy for returns. Namely, they will accept all returns and it is the vendor’s responsibility, my responsibility. You buy Exploding Kittens from GameKnight, you play the game, you damage all the cards because you spilled beer all over them, you put them back in the box the next day after you had a great time and you return it and now that’s my cost. And that happens hundreds of times a week. It sucks. There’s also this thing where people will buy counterfeit games and they’ll buy, then, the real version. They’ll buy a counterfeit for a dollar, they’ll buy the real version on Amazon, they’ll keep the real version, they’ll return the counterfeit and now that’s mine as well. And I just spent $20 on that stupid counterfeit version because that’s coming back to me. All of this stuff has to be thought through in advance and it’s tricky, because some retailers, the Targets and the Walmarts in the world, they are so willing to work with you on that stuff. Amazon, not so much. They’re just like, “Oh, you don’t like our policy? All right, well maybe a different platform is for you.” It’s hard. It’s really hard. Tim Ferriss: And I should say that I’ve run into, when I’ve talked about termination clauses or what do we do when everyone’s pissed off and things aren’t working? Because really that’s the only time that you’re going to go back and look at the agreement, which is why Gary Keller, famous for his real estate empire, said, “You should really call them disagreements.” The only time you’re going to look at them is when things are really going sideways. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And there are some people I’ve spoken to about the importance of these things, like, “Wow, that’s really pessimistic.” I’m like, “No, no, no.” Let’s understand the consequences of not going through this. I know so many examples of entrepreneurs who actually had a chance at a runaway success and they did not pay attention to these terms for, say, a QVC or a huge retailer. And this could happen with Kickstarter as well, of course, they get overextended because now they have orders for God knows how much inventory that is well beyond their capacity, their experience, their financial means. And in their mind, let’s take out the Kickstarter or crowdfunding, but they don’t think about the return policy and they get the hug of death. They overextend themselves financially to produce the inventory, they ship it, and then any number of things can happen. It might be net 270 payment terms. Elan Lee: Oh, God. Tim Ferriss: It could be just — Elan Lee: So brutal. Tim Ferriss: — cash flow suicide right on the front end. And on top of that you might get all of it shipped back to you — Elan Lee: All of it. Tim Ferriss: — and it’s your problem. And then that — Elan Lee: It’s so tragic. Tim Ferriss: — is the hug of death and you’re done. Elan Lee: And then you’ve seen this, you’ve seen this picture. You have this friend whose apartment is filled with products and it’s taken over their living space and they have no way to move it. Tim Ferriss: I did that myself early on. I made an audiobook product. I was going to sell millions of this thing. Oh, my God. Didn’t do any market testing, none of that stuff, just high on my own supply. And I had an entire garage full of these things that just melted in the heat ultimately. And at the time though, that was a huge financial risk. I didn’t take so much risk that it torpedoed me, but if I had had that level of self-delusion and lack of experimentation a little later on, it very easily could have been a recipe for disaster. Elan Lee: Totally. Look, there’s so many ways to mess this up. There’s so many ways to mess this up. And the only good news is there is someone out there who has messed it up in every possible way. Tim Ferriss: Or represented people who have messed it up — Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: — in every possible way. Elan Lee: And those are the people you have to work with. You have to. If you don’t, the risk you’re taking on is just massive. Luckily, I had some very good advice early on from people who said, “Don’t take this on yourself. Just don’t do this.” And it’s the best advice I ever got. Tim Ferriss: And I think maybe tell me if this is overreaching on my part, but don’t take this on yourself now in the sense that after you’ve had 10 mega successes and you actually are fluent in retailese and you have the relationships, all right, now you can take some calculated risks. Elan Lee: And now you can hire the people that you would otherwise contract, now you can pull them in-house. Because now you can afford their salaries and now you want them to only be working on your own products. Great. That’s a huge mark of success and really that is exactly the way you reinvest in your own company. Tim Ferriss: And to reiterate just a few things, if you want to develop a game, number one, you can just develop it for your family, your friends, and keep it small. And I will just say in the book world, a lot of later mega successes have started out that way. You don’t have to go for scale, which I think can be a very dangerous word out of the gate. But as you mentioned, you can also, with the blank cards in Coyote, you can get a taste of it, see if you like it, then you can use the books that you recommended. And there are certainly other resources, we’ll put things in the show notes, to play around with prototyping. Look at these initial cards. These are blank cards with Sharpie writing on them. Elan Lee: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Elan Lee: That’s literally it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it, that’s the entire thing. And you can also find kits online, you can find them anywhere you want. Amazon has gaming kits where there are blank dice and cards and so on so you can workshop it. Elan Lee: Easy. It’s so easy. Tim Ferriss: It’s like Build-A-Bear for games basically. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And what I would add to that is you don’t need to run a big business to be a successful game designer. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: In fact, I would imagine most of the legendary game designers are not running companies. Elan Lee: No, definitely not. Tim Ferriss: They’re designing games and licensing them. And man, there are some legends out there. Elan Lee: Legends. They’ve created incredible games and they’ve generated gigantic wealth for themselves because in success, that two percent deal, that five percent deal, whatever it is, that faucet doesn’t turn off, that’s in perpetuity. In summary, I don’t think the games business is going anywhere. Tim Ferriss: And also there is a lot of room to innovate. There still is room. There’s so many games, but I wouldn’t have even attempted to create a game had I not thought there was space. Elan Lee: The thing is, it’s like saying, is there still space in the book industry, in the movie industry? All a game is is an idea delivered in a new way. When are we going to run out of ideas? When are we going to run out of delivery mechanisms? The answer to both of those individually is never. Combine them both together and it’s just build games forever. You’ll always have a new way — Tim Ferriss: Option. Elan Lee: — to deliver it. Tim Ferriss: All right, so I’m trying to think of anything that we missed. I do have a tantalizing offer for listeners and viewers just for fun because why not? And we will have also mentioned that in the intro. But before I get to that, anything critical that we’ve forgotten? Is there anything that we have left out or any other resources, people to watch, maybe people to Google and Wikipedia maybe? Anything at all? Elan Lee: All right. I’ve got two. I’ve got two that are interesting. One is there is a podcast I quite like for game design, it’s called Fun Problems, it’s with Peter and AJ. And all they do is they talk about game design. Now, they do talk about more hardcore games than I am accustomed to. It’s a wide range of topics, but it’s fun stuff and it’s worth listening to if you want to know more about game design. And the second thing is, because of you. Because of you, because of this process, this journey that we’ve been on over the last few years, I realized that I don’t document any of this ever. I never talk about what goes into a game design, I never talk about where to buy blank cards, and I never talk about why anybody can do this and what the process is like. I’ve started recording it and I started for the first time, I can’t believe I’m saying this, I actually started a YouTube channel and you can actually go and watch these instructional videos. Literally if you want to make a game, the whole idea is: here is how to make a game from scratch. Nobody’s watching right now, but — Tim Ferriss: YouTube.com at Elan Lee, that’s E-L-A-N-L-E-E. You can also just search him on YouTube. The first result will be our podcast together. Elan Lee: That’s true. Tim Ferriss: Episode one. And then within the first few results, you’ll also find it. But I’m pretty sure the URL is YouTube.com/@ElanLee. And let’s finish up with a few things. The first will be the tantalizing offer that I mentioned. The tantalizing offer is this, there’s no purchase required whatsoever, so if any sweepstakes sharks are out there, take it easy, take it easy. This is going to be just a fun little, it’s not even a competition, just a fun little experiment that I want to run. *** [Interview pauses] 02:46:00 to 02:48:14 Tim Ferriss: Hi, everyone, Tim here with an update, as details have changed since that first conversation with Elan. Here’s the tantalizing offer that I wanted to share with you. You have two very easy ways to enter for a chance to win a trip to a secret Los Angeles mansion for an unforgettable day or evening with me and Elan and maybe some special guests. Here’s how. Option number one, simply visit any Target or Walmart and take a fun photo or video with a Coyote game. No purchase necessary. Option number two, if you already bought Coyote, record yourself playing the game with friends or family. That’s it. I would love to see it. Then share your photo or video on Instagram or Tik Tok or both and tag me and ExplodingKittens. You can find us easily, but I’m @TimFerris on both. That’s @ Tim F-e-r-r-i-s-s and Exploding Kittens is ExplodingKittens on Tik Tok and @GameOfKittens on Instagram. So share your photo and or video on Instagram and or Tik Tok. Put them everywhere. Why not? And tag both me and Exploding Kittens. Longtime listeners know that I have a love of deadlines. This is how things actually get done. So, the deadline to post is August 17. That means that 10:00 p.m. PDT August 17. By then, you need to have posted and done all this stuff. By August 31st, we’ll randomly select five winners from people who post. Each winner will receive roundtrip airfare within the US, one night at a hotel, and will join us at our secret LA mansion party. And I think the legal elves wanted me to mention that that’s going to be coach airfare. So, just to be super clear, important legal disclaimer. No purchase necessary. Open to US residents aged 18 or older. So no little kids, no minotaurs allowed. Void where prohibited. Winners selected at random. Odds depend on number of eligible entries. Travel dates must align with the event likely in September. We are still finalizing the time with the busiest man in show business, Elan Lee himself. For official rules, eligibility details, and final date, please visit tim.blog/rules. So, go ahead, post a creative Tik Tok or Insta real or a photo with Coyote by August 17th, 10 p.m. PDT. Tag us and you might just be celebrating with us in Hollywood this fall. Now, back to the episode. *** [Interview resumes] Tim Ferriss: What else? Anything else to add? I have a little bit. I have one more thing I want to say. Elan Lee: Oh, okay. I want to hear one more thing. Tim Ferriss: I just wanted to thank you so much for allowing me to be part of this incredible ride — Elan Lee: Oh, my goodness. Tim Ferriss: — and just collaborating on the game. It’s been so meaningful for me and so much fun and so great to get closer with you and your family, and we’ve all been traveling together since. Elan Lee: I love it. Tim Ferriss: And to work with the incredible team that you have at Exploding Kittens. I’m not going to mention them all because there are quite few — Elan Lee: So many. Tim Ferriss: — but it’s just been such a joy and a dream come true to actually have this thing in my mind that was floating around that I’ve always wanted to do. And now here it is and people can get it. Elan Lee: Tim Ferriss made a game. Look, here’s the thing — Tim Ferriss: I’m thinking — Elan Lee: — you’re so welcome and thank you. We have limited time here and you have to choose your endeavors wisely, and this was one of the wisest choices I’ve ever made. Tim Ferriss: Oh, thanks, man. All right. We’re going to go get a fantastic meal. It’s Texas, so probably a bunch of meat, barbecue. Who knows, maybe some tequila and make an appearance unbidden. You never know. Strange things happen out here in Austin, Texas. And for everybody listening, we will link to all sorts of things, many resources that will help you think about how you might create a game. You could start with the blank cards in Coyote. Those will actually teach you a lot, I think, as you begin to experiment with these different elements. Elan Lee: Because you’re going to fail, because your first few are not going to work and you’ll learn why. Tim Ferriss: And then if you run out of blank cards, look, just go get some blank cards. Just go buy a blank deck and you can use those. But this is something anyone can do. You did this with your daughter when she was how old? Elan Lee: Four. Tim Ferriss: Four. This is an incredibly fun family activity. It’s an incredibly fun friend activity and it gets you off of your screens. It’s not good for you folks. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: They are tools, but there is a point at which the tools become our masters and that is where a lot of the poison seeps in around the cracks. Elan Lee: This thing builds memories. That’s what you should be doing. That’s what your phone isn’t doing. This is building memories. Tim Ferriss: Building memories with some durability, not ephemera that get pushed out of your head as soon as you watch the next 10-second clip. This is something I’ve wanted to do for so long and I’m thrilled that it’s here. Fingers crossed. I’m still nervous as hell, obviously. But we’ve done so much play testing. Hundreds of people have play tested at this point and have made these fine-tuning tweaks along the way. I would love everybody to think about your life as a collection of games. You may not be aware of which games you’re playing just yet, but rest assured in some respects you are playing games and you get to choose more games than you realize. Most of them are optional, not all of them. Sure, we have responsibilities as adults and so on, but this is a way to open up that Pandora’s box of possibility. And we’ll include a lot of resources in the show notes, so tim.blog/podcast, just search Coyote. That’ll probably be the easiest way to find it. C-O-Y-O-T-E. And another time I’ll explain the backstory there, which is pretty wild, but for another time. And until next time, as always, be a little kinder than is necessary, not just to others, also to yourself. Play wisely. Find fun problems. And I’m going to check out that podcast. And life is short, have fun while you’re here, folks. And until next time, thanks for tuning in. Δ Δ Comment Rules: Remember what Fonzie was like? Cool. That's how we're gonna be — cool.

This is a very special episode for me, one I’ve been looking forward to publishing for months. It features a behind-the-scenes look at my latest creative project, my new game COYOTE. COYOTE is a fast, casual card game I created with Elan and the Exploding Kittens team. It has been my obsession for two years. I worked really hard on every aspect of this one (concept, mechanics, art, you name it)! You can finally buy it everywhere, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and 8,000+ retail locations worldwide. It’s been a hit with 100+ test families, my friends, and at conferences around the world. It now produces guaranteed laughs with kids, adults, tipsy people, serious people… all who enjoy unleashing their inner trickster. If you’ve benefited from my podcast, newsletter, books, or anything at all, please grab a copy or two! It only costs $10-12 and can provide hours upon hours of fun. It takes minutes to learn and 10 minutes to play. Under the hood, it’s also designed to be a good workout for your brain. If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to get a product on the shelves of something like Walmart or Target, or simply create a game, this podcast covers it all. P.S. One last thing: read to the end for a very fun surprise that involves a mystery Hollywood party.

This is another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. I’m Tim Ferriss and I’m sitting with a friend of mine who I brought to my podcast with a secret agenda that has ended up two years later with a very, very not-so-secret-for-long outcome that we’re going to talk about, Elan Lee. Elan Lee: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: Nice to see you again. Elan Lee: It’s nice to see you too. That was a secret agenda. That was a two-year-in-the-making secret agenda. Tim Ferriss: Two years in the making. So what we’re going to do in this conversation, and I just hijacked his bio because I’ve had too much caffeine, so I’m going to let him do the self-intro in a second. But we’re going to give you a peek behind the curtain, under the hood, open the kimono, choose your metaphor. We’re going to talk about the creative process, the development process, thinking about distribution, retail, all of these things which I have not heard discussed anywhere else in depth. Elan Lee: You buried the lead. All of that stuff of — Tim Ferriss: Of a game that we created that from the very beginning was something I’ve wanted to do my whole life, which is create a game. I was raised, protected in some ways by Dungeons & Dragons as a kid. It was my refuge from bullying and also just the straight boredom of most of my schooling at the time. And that immersive experience, the ability to get lost in a world of imagination and fun and laughter and emotion was so incredibly important. It was so formative for me that the seed was planted really early. And I think you know this because I probably sent you a photograph of this at one point. I still have all of my modules. I have The Player’s Handbook, First Edition, Dungeon Master’s Guide, all of the dice, everything from when I was a kid. I’ve kept it to this day. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. But hold on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: If you’re not going to say it, I’m going to say it. Tim Ferriss made a game. Tim Ferriss: I did. Elan Lee: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It took me 47 years, but here we are. So the game, I’ll just show it to camera for people who want a visual who are not watching this. If you’re listening, you can go to tim.blog/coyote. So I’m giving a bit of what you might call foreshadowing in the biz. But this is the game. It is a card game. It’s called Coyote. That name did not come easily. We went through about 537 different names and lots of testing and we’ll talk about some of that. But this is the game and it’s effectively, I’d like to hear your pitch because we have slightly different approaches, but I would say it is rock-paper-scissors on steroids. So there are God knows how many, maybe 20 different gestures, something like that, 66 total cards. And you can play cooperatively where you’re all trying to beat the game together or competitively where you can sabotage individual players, throw curveballs of all different types, and that relates to the name Coyote, if you think about the trickster mythology associated with Coyote. Elan Lee: Yeah Tim Ferriss: We never got to your bio. Who the hell are you? Elan Lee: Oh, that’s the least interesting part of this whole thing. Tim Ferriss: No, I know, but it puts it in perspective and just explain the company a bit, the scope of it, et cetera Elan Lee: I love talking about games, I hate talking about myself. So I will try. Tim Ferriss: That’s why it takes someone like me to force you to do it. Elan Lee: Yeah. Okay, here we go. My name is Elan Lee. I am the co-creator and CEO of Exploding Kittens. I believe we’re the number one independent game studio in the world, something like that. I don’t know. We’ve sold a whole bunch of games. We’ve sold 60 million games at this point and been running that company for 10 years now. And before that I was the chief design officer at the Xbox and before that I worked at a pet store. Tim Ferriss: And for people who want the full journey, including the sort of magical tinderbox that was Kickstarter way back in the day, how this whole adventure started 10 plus years ago, listen to the first conversation that I did with Elan. I had wanted to make a game and quickly realized that an RPG, something like Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, was going to be too complicated for me and my friends as adults to play. It would be too hard for me to recruit my friends where you have, let’s just say, a full day, then you have dinner, maybe you have a few drinks, and then you have an hour before people split. There’s no way I’m going to get someone to build, for instance, a chaotic good gray elf, which was my orientation, and work from there. It’s just not going to happen. And meanwhile, about maybe it was a year or two years before I invited you on the podcast, I found this game Poetry for Neanderthals and holy shit, had so much fun with that with my friends. I thought, “Okay, I think I want to tilt my game dreams,” which at that point had no real direction, “towards something more casual.” But in the meantime, I’d also been listening to all sorts of podcasts and so on that we’ll get to. But you’ve explained your background. Elan Lee: Well, hold on. So what you just described is exactly why I started Exploding Kittens, because I also — okay, a little bit different. Unlike you, I, when I encounter those crazy two and four and six-hour games, I am immediately turned off. I can’t focus for that long. I can’t understand the rules. If it takes longer than five minutes to explain a game, I am gone. I have no ability to play that game. And so the whole reason I started this company, and I think the whole reason that you made the pivot from giant role-playing games to being interested in the creation of casual fast-party games is this golden rule of two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play because nothing’s at stake there, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: You’re going to learn it. You’re either going to love the game or you’re going to hate it, but whatever, you committed five minutes total to that thing. And I love the games where after the five-minute commitment, you’re still going to play for two hours. But they’re going to be in these little five-minute sessions over and over and over again. And it sounds like that’s the experience you had, which makes me so happy because that means mission accomplished. That’s exactly what I wanted to build. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to talk about different rules or tenets that you have because what I want to do in this conversation, we’re definitely going to talk about the process of building this game because I am really, really happy with it and really proud. Elan Lee: It’s so good. You should be. It’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And we’ll have a lot to talk about. But the motivation also of basically showing the cards, I’m going to use so many mixed metaphors here, is to teach people game design and explain why this has possessed such a toehold in my mind for so long. Elan Lee: Yeah. Well, you went through a journey and I’m excited looking at that journey through your eyes of, “I don’t even know what I want to build, but I know I want to build a fun experience that I would enjoy, that my friends would enjoy,” all the way through to this thing is at every Walmart and Target in North America. That journey is incredible and you got to see it for the first time. You absolutely drank from the firehose here. This was fun for me because I had to walk you through this, right? You’ve never sold a game before. So walking through the process of how you make a game and how you sell a game, it doesn’t work the way people think. So retailers have a buyer per category. So if anybody wants to sell something to a retailer, you want something in Target or Walmart or Amazon or Barnes & Noble. The way it works is you have to convince the buyer for your category to take your thing, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They have limited shelf space. It’s very precious real estate. So you have to convince them that your thing is better than anybody else’s thing. And twice a year they have these things called line reviews.The buyers have to buy games for next year, right? They need to put stuff on the shelf. There’s only a certain number of meetings they can physically have in a period of time because it’s usually one or two or maybe three people. So they take as many meetings as they can. It’s usually a dozen, maybe two dozen. And in those meetings — Tim Ferriss: In your case, with different game manufacturers, different studios. Elan Lee: Exactly. So they’ll take a meeting with Hasbro and they’ll take a meeting with Mattel and all the big guys. And in those meetings, 20, 30, 50 games are pitched to them in every single one of those meetings. And then they’ll make a decision on which ones they’re going to purchase and stock for the next year. So that’s line review. The tricky parts for line review is one, you got to do a great job, but even before that, you got to get that meeting, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They only have time for a certain number of meetings. So you have to put yourself in a position where you can get in that room. Tim Ferriss: All right, so we’re going to talk strategy and tactics for line review in a minute because, and take this as a compliment, you are one of the best in-person salespeople I’ve ever seen. Elan Lee: That could also be an insult, but I’ll take it, I’ll take it. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s not an insult. No, no, it’s not an insult. Everybody’s in sales, whether they like to admit it or not, whether you’re selling ideas, you’re selling a position, a perspective, if you want to call it deal making. This is what I used to say in my class, my guest lecture that I taught for 10 years, once or twice a year in high-tech entrepreneurship. I would start off by saying, “Who here wants to be in sales?” No hands would go up and I would say, “Well, I’ve got some good news and I’ve got some bad news. Bad news is you’re all in sales. And let me explain why. If you want to call it deal making, fine, you’re going to have to negotiate. You don’t get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate.” Elan Lee: That’s well said. Tim Ferriss: “And you get what you can present in a very persuasive way.” I was like, “The good news is you can learn it.” Elan Lee: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: This is a coachable, learnable skill, which I completely still believe. There’s some people who may have a little bit of extraversion, charismatic reality, distortion, field advantage, but you can become excellent even if you start with zero raw materials. Okay, so the journey, wanted to make a game my whole life, but it was this vague, “Maybe someday. God, wouldn’t it be nice?” Elan Lee: Let me just poke at that for a second. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sure. Elan Lee: Why? Tim Ferriss: The why is I wanted to imbue someone else’s experience with the magic I felt playing D&D. Elan Lee: Well said. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Or much easier games, right? It’s such a simple game. I used to play Sorry and Monopoly. And as a young kid, I just thought Sorry was the most hilarious thing when you could look someone in the eyes and go, “Sorry,” and knock their stuff off the board. I didn’t always respond well when it happened to me. It doesn’t have to be the incredibly immersive, complex game that D&D is, although I still think that is just like Gary Gygax and the team way back in the day, holy cow. Also, by the way, for people who don’t know, Gen Con, huge convention, started out around Lake Geneva and was, I believe, created by the TSR guys way back in the day. Elan Lee: I believe that’s right. Yeah. Yeah, Gen Con from Lake Geneva and then was the Generals Convention, and now is nothing. Now Gen Con doesn’t stand for anything because it’s in Indianapolis. But anyway, sorry. It was an aside. Tim Ferriss: It’s an aside. So that was the kind of impetus behind wanting to make a game, but it didn’t have any form. And then I suppose it was maybe two and a half, three years ago, I was like, “Okay, I’d like to actually take a deeper dive here.” Because there are lots of things we have on our, say, list of New Year’s resolutions. For instance, for a long time I had “Develop the side splits like Jean-Claude Van Damme.” Never happened, but it was there every fucking year and it just got punted. I was like, “Well, didn’t do it. Okay, this year is the year.” But there was no plan, there were no deadlines, there were no constraints, which is the power of constraints, which we’ll probably talk about. Elan Lee: Absolutely, yes. Tim Ferriss: It is so critical. It’s not just critical. It is additive to have constraints, which seems like a contradiction, but it’s not. Well, we’ll, I’m sure, get to that. So I started looking at different options and the catalyst for this actually was something way back in the day, some of you will remember called The Legend of CØCKPUNCH, and that was an NFT project — remember those? Which raised two million bucks for fundamental science and mechanistic studies basically related to mental health. So all the proceeds from that, if you want to look it up, it’s easy to find Legend of CØCKPUNCH. But all the proceeds went to a nonprofit foundation, which then funds mental health, therapeutic research and things related to that. But in the process of doing that, I got to, with very low stakes because I think it’s helpful when possible, especially if you’re an intrepid beginner wading into unfamiliar creative waters, make the stakes super, super low, right? And even before this podcast, it’s like, “Okay, this is a very unusual conversation where it’s like, “Look, we’re not doing this live. If we really don’t like it, we can scrap the whole thing.” So reduce, reduce, reduce the pressure and the stakes until you can get started, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: With writing, I got the advice long ago, two crappy pages per day. That’s it. Elan Lee: Love it. Tim Ferriss: And then you actually put pen to paper. Elan Lee: Yeah, the overlaps are enormous with games. But, yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Super related. Also the iterative process. All right, so using The Legend of CØCKPUNCH as this pretext, basically I started writing fiction and so I wrote these very, very, it turned out to be very involved, very viable fantasy histories and pieces, tying all of these greater houses together and then having these protagonists, the father and then the son, who’s Tyrolean, and yada, yada, yada, yada. And I still think there might be something there, but in the process of creating that, I thought to myself, “This would actually make a fantastic game. And it wouldn’t have to be as complicated as D&D, but you would have allies, you would have age old amenities, would have different strengths, certain strengths that cancel out other strengths, weaknesses that can be taken advantage of.” And that led me to start listening to a podcast called Think Like a Game Designer with Justin Gary, which is outstanding. I recommend people check it out. And a lot of the focus there, not entirely, but a lot of the focus there was on trading card games, alternately called collectible card games, I guess. Wizards of the Coast who created Magic: The Gathering, patented and trademarked one of them. So they seem to be used interchangeably. But Justin, also former high-level competitive Magic: The Gathering player, has a lot of knowledge around that world. He’s developed some incredibly successful games in that genre where you’re building a deck, you’re buying certain cards or decks with the hopes of getting certain cards and assembling your toolkit basically. And that was initially where my mind went in terms of game concept. But I realized a few things really quickly. I was a D&D guy, which predated Magic: The Gathering. My brother was a Magic: The Gathering guy. But I’ve never really played Magic. And when I began to delve into it, I was like, “You know what? I would like to think of this as D&D light, but this is incredibly nuanced.” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: To be good at this — Elan Lee: Oh, for sure, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — it is incredibly nuanced. And also if you’re against someone who is really experienced or just has their mind wired for it, you are going to be obliterated. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And that’s what happened to me playing a friend of mine, kudos to Mike, just got slayed. And God bless Mike, he’s like a number of my friends who just kind of want to watch you die slowly in this agonizing ill-fated gameplay where you’re kind of whimpering along until they put you out of your misery. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, you play a card, he said, “Isn’t this cute? You think you’ve got it. Watch this.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is just not really my thing. So I thought to myself, okay, looking at some of the casual games I really like, there is an opportunity, and this will come back later, for the underdog or the person who is behind to win. So there’s an element, it is skill-based, but there’s an element of chance and this is going to come back. So then Poetry for Neanderthals, I don’t know how I found it initially, frankly. I think I probably went into a game shop and I was like, “Hey,” and this relates to why, as an adult, I want to spend less time in front of screens and ultimately if I look back and do this thing every year called a past year review, people can find it online, you can read all about it and do it yourself. You don’t have to buy anything, past year review. Where I look at the peak positive and negative emotional experiences of the past year, I go through my whole calendar. Sometimes I’ll go through my photos, sometimes I’ll go through my text messages or my sent folder in the inbox. And lo and behold, and this is not a revelation for some people, but the activities did not matter as much as the people. So then the question is, how do I create different contexts for interacting with, let’s just say, my 10 or 15 closest friends? Some of that is doing things outside in the wilderness that are active and so on. But that’s a heavy lift, that’s a heavier lift than — Elan Lee: A high barrier of entry. Tim Ferriss: — playing a casual game, right? So it’s like if I’m here in Austin, where we are right now, and my friends or a bunch of my friends come in for South by Southwest and I manage to get them together for one night, what can we play that will get us off of our goddamn phones and deepen our relationship and create memories that we can hold onto that will stick around? That’s it. That’s it, right? Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: And then we had our conversation and that’s kind of when everything, I guess, kicked off. Just a couple of things maybe that we should mention also. After our conversation when, I think, very shyly I must have reached out to you at some point shortly thereafter, and I was kind of like, “Hey, guy, not sure if this would be interesting, but maybe kind of sort, do you want to talk about maybe making a game together or something?” Elan Lee: I remember this exact conversation. It’s like asking me out on a first date. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like scratching my head looking at the ground. And that’s how the whole thing got kicked off. And I want to mention something related to that, which was for the last probably three years, my New Year’s resolutions have been very — they’re very broad, but they’re pretty specific. So I had two. One is doing more delegation, which is figure it out delegation. So what that means is rather than doing what I’m hardwired to do with my OCD and perfectionism, which is, “Here, go do this thing. Let me give you a 20-page installation manual explaining exactly what to do,” versus, “Here’s roughly what I want done. Just figure it out and get it done. I don’t want to make any decisions, So don’t come back to me with 12 options. Just make the best you can.” And I’ll expect Reid Hoffman also, LinkedIn has mentioned this sort of a 10 percent footfall rate, like 10 percent of the time something’s going to go sideways and that’s fine in the interest of reducing decision fatigue and making things faster. So one was more figure it out delegation and number two was sprints with creatives. And for me what that meant as someone who has operated as a lone wolf, which by the way is a contradiction in terms, but who has been a solo operator for most of my creative projects, I was like, “You know what? It just isn’t that fun anymore to do it solo.” And it’s also antithetical to some of the creative projects I want to pursue like a game. I mean, there are some amazing solo game designers. Not to say there aren’t, but I was like, “You know what? I want to try to be more social in my creativity and collaborate with creatives and do sprints.” Now, sometimes those sprints turn into longer things, but those have been sort of my two guiding lights for the last few years, which is what then gave me the ability to build up the courage. It sounds so ridiculous to say, but to actually reach out to you and be like, “Hey, do you want to actually just bat around the possibility of something?” Elan Lee: So from my perspective, that conversation, I got very excited to work with you on something, one, because it turns out you’re just a lovely human being and so much fun to hang out with. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: But two, I asked you that very fundamental question. You said, “Hey, do you want to build a game?” And I said, “Why do you want to build a game?” And your answer was almost identical to what you just related. You talked about your past experiences, you talked about childhood memories of games, you talked about what you like and what you don’t like. And what became very clear to me was there’s something special going on here. Tim wants to treat his friends and his audience to something extraordinary. And we get approached all the time by people who want to make games, big celebrities and singers and actors, all of them want to make a game. And whenever I ask them the question “Why?” the answer is invariably, “Because my agent told me to,” or, “Because I think I can make money,” or really very superficial. Often they’re not game players at all. They have no connection to the experience of game design. And when I spoke to you, none of that was present. Instead it was, “This is a very personal thing to me, and ultimately I want to give a gift.” And that’s when my brain started lighting up. It’s like, “Oh, this is going to be fun. He’s in this for all the reasons I’m in this and that means we can make something very special together.” And I think we have. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, we definitely have. And another question that is sometimes a little tricky to apply, but that has been in my mind for a while, since Seth Godin, very well-known author, thinker, just incredibly sage and awesome human being. He reframed for me, which is the reframing of the question, “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s a good question. Like what would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail? All right, that’s freeing. But the way he tweaks that is he said, “What would you do if you knew you would fail?” In other words, like, what would you do for which the process alone would make it worth it? And for me, because I mean, we became fast friends very quickly, and I was like, “Okay, that’s rare for me as an adult, number one.” And I’ve been banging this around in my own little head for so long. Even if this ends up not making the cut for whatever reason, this seems worth it to me, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because coming back to the people over activities also, I was like, “Love hanging out with Elan and connecting. I am going to learn a lot.” And at the very worst, I learn a lot and we’ve deepened our relationship. And that stuff just snowballs over time. It transcends a single project. So even if this had not manifested, it would’ve been worth it and that’s how I try to pick my projects these days. Elan Lee: So when we first started down this path together, I remember I came out, we sort of visited each other back and forth a few times. And I remember every time I would pack a suitcase full of games and we would sit with some of your friends and we’d play games all night long and you’d say, “I like this one. I don’t like this one. I like this part.” But ultimately, we weren’t making any progress. We were just learning vocabulary, essentially. And I would go home and my wife would be like, “How’d it go? What did you learn? Are you going to make a game together?” And I’d be like, “I don’t know. No, we just hung out and had fun.” And she’d be like, “Wasn’t that a huge disappointment? You traveled 2,000 miles to go see him?” I’m like, “No, it was just fun. Nah, I’m not disappointed at all. We’ll just do it again next month and we’ll see how it goes.” And we did that five or six times. And I remember walking away from each one just thinking, same thing, “If this goes nowhere, I’m having so much fun.” That’s so rare. Tim Ferriss: It is rare. And if you can orient your life or professional life, and look, I’m not saying this is possible for everyone, but it’s to some extent more possible than people realize. You might not be able to run out and invite Elan on your podcast and then awkwardly approach him like a sheepish 12-year-old boy to ask him on a date. But taking the lens of picking projects based on creating or deepening relationships and learning/developing skills, if you just do that over time, it is almost inevitable that you will win, whatever winning means to you. Elan Lee: Yeah, value the process, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So let’s talk a little bit about the origin story. Now, I’ll throw out a couple of things here and we’re going to talk about the game development, and then we’re also going to talk about how to sell this thing. How does that work? Elan Lee: And it’s worth saying, designing a game, I remember you asked me this early on. You started out from the, “Hey, let’s design a game,” and then we’re basically done. And I remember really forcing myself to think through this process because I wanted to explain it to you. “No, that’s half of it. The other half is selling the game. And just as much work goes into that. And if you’re not willing to do it or if you have no mechanism by which you can do it, might as well not design the game because one without the other, useless.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. So it depends on the scale you’re going after, right? If you want to make something for your friends, you can do that. Elan Lee: Sure, Yeah, okay. Fair enough. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But in this particular case, I mean — Elan Lee: You wanted to make something cool and share it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I wanted to share. I wanted to share it. So that kind of dictated parts of the process that we needed to weigh really heavily. So the game development process, I mean, we started off looking at the possibilities of modifying existing games, right? So looking at, say, Poetry for Neanderthals — Elan Lee: Poetry, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — with an alternate set of rules or a different deck plus A, B, or C. We looked at prototype games that you alluded to earlier, bringing the suitcase, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So we did that all over the country. Elan Lee: Yeah, I showed up, I remember. So I have this notebook of game ideas three, 400 in there, and I add more every month. And I remember I picked my favorites, like five or six of them, and I would show up with just the jankiest prototypes. Like, “Here’s something I scribbled on a few cards.” I took some dice and I rubbed out the little nubs on the dice and hand wrote something on all the die faces. “Instead, let’s try playing this weird game.” And you were very patient and you had a lot of vision, thankfully, to look at these just horrible, very hastily created prototypes and say, not, “This is no fun, let’s move on.” But you would always say, “Oh, I like this. I like the — that moment where we had a conversation about what you were going to do next. I like that part. I didn’t like the rest of it, but I like that part.” And that astute sense of notes, really thoughtful and forward moving notes was ultimately what guided our conversation. Because then the next time, I don’t have to pick from 400 games to bring. Now I know, “Okay, this cooperative thing, he liked that conversation aspect. There’s only six games I’ve got like that. Let me bring those six and we’ll refine it even farther.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. So we can talk about the Toronto trip. The Toronto project. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: That is where things started to gel. Because we’d had a number of these meetings around the country where we would do a one to three day sprint of testing, take all these notes and we’d done a few of these and we’ve both got a lot going on and your wife would ask you how it went and you’re like, “Well, I’m not really sure. I think we had fun, but no game as of yet.” And so we scheduled time. I was going to fly to Toronto to do a sprint. You were going to bring in an expert game designer, sort of game mechanic specialist — Elan Lee: Ken Gruhl, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — Ken. And it was like, “Okay, this is the trip. If we make it happen, great. If not, we’re just going to call spade a spade.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We were circling around this thing but not really getting it done. Elan Lee: It was like meeting number eight or nine at that point. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we tried a lot. And it was during that trip that the very primitive sort of germ of an idea started to resonate, which ended up being Coyote. And I remember a few things, and thank God also for Ken’s apparent photographic memory with the way things transpired, but we’re walking around all over the place in Toronto, the three of us, just spitballing. Then it starts to rain and we seek shelter. We failed twice, I think, with various coffee shops. Elan Lee: Yeah, can’t get in. Tim Ferriss: No room, no seats, whatever it might be. End up sitting in this weird kind of multipurpose building. And I remember where we were sitting and we played, I guess in English it’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: Hanabi. Tim Ferriss: Hanabi, which is Hanabi in Japanese, which is fireworks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And hana’s flower. Bi in this case is fire. So it’s like flower fire. That’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: For everybody out there, if you haven’t played Hanabi, go try this game. It is very special. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So we played that game, kind of killing time, giving it a shot, because you guys had mentioned it. And I was like, “Okay, this is a very elegant game.” And from that, liked the cooperative aspect. So when people think game, I think most folks are more familiar, maybe exclusively familiar, with the sort of winner-takes-all or team-versus-team competitive type of game. But I really enjoyed, and I’d seen this in other ways in different capacities, but the cooperative option and the cooperative aspect of this. So that then gets stuck in the mind and the rain clears up. We go for a walk by the water. And I remember we were sort of — well, I’ll own it, I was kind of stalled. I’ll be the kind of hair plugging the drain in the bathtub. Because I was trying to search my mind for game examples. But I was thinking tabletop games because that was the canvas we were painting upon. And we’re walking, we’re walking. We’ve had quite a bit of caffeine by this point and it was either you or Ken, I think it was you, who asked, “Well, just broadly speaking, any kind of game, what games have you really enjoyed?” And that’s where Rock, Paper, Scissors came up, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Rochambeau. And I just — as dumb as it might sound, and I said this at the time, I was like, “I love Rock, Paper, Scissors.” Especially when you play over an extended period of time with friends, maybe there’s some alcohol involved or not, you don’t need to have it involved. But you start to pick up tells, you start to pick up patterns, and it’s actually very, very fun. Elan Lee: So it’s important to note, the moment you bring up Rock, Paper, Scissors in any game design discussion, that’s usually the end of the conversation, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because there’s nothing to that game. There’s three tools, deploy a tool, determine a winner, you’re done. It is only when you say, “Let’s acknowledge Rock, Paper, Scissors is no fun unless you play multiple times.” Because now we’ve made a very important transition. We’re not playing the game anymore, we’re playing each other. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Right? Because I know what you did last time. You think I’m going to throw scissors again. And now we’re playing each other. Yes, rock, paper, scissors are the tools by which we’re playing each other, but suddenly we’re playing a very different game and it starts — it cannot start in round one. It starts in round two and it moves forward from there. And once we started having that discussion, things started to get really interesting. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, things got interesting. And do you want to show the prototype deck? Elan Lee: Yeah, I’ll show. Tim Ferriss: And part of the reason I want to show this prototype deck, and we’ll describe it for people who aren’t watching, is quick and dirty is the fucking way to go. And I will just make another recommendation for Stephen Key. So Stephen Key has a book called the One Simple Idea, which is about licensing and creating inventions. He’s got a number of books now. But Stephen has made a gajillion dollars creating games for all the biggies that you can possibly think of. And he uses construction paper and glue you would find in a second grade class and a handful of markers. Elan Lee: Love it. This is already my — Tim Ferriss: And this is by and large, that is how he creates these amazing — now, when I say — they can be games, they can be toys. He’s pretty broad spectrum. But it might be a new way to play basketball, shooting dirty laundry into a hamper, right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Something like that. And he prototypes these things incredibly quickly. And for him, for what he does, that is enough. He is able to put together a pitch, he’s able to sell it and he’s able to develop these amazing passive income streams with these annuities that just come in — Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: — from all these different places. But that relates to what we’re looking at. Elan Lee: Okay. I love that we have not even described what Coyote is yet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Elan Lee: But that’s okay because it’s more fun I think, to walk — I think the value of this conversation is to actually talk through the creative process and talk through — I think a lot of people want to make games, this is how you do it. And we went through this two-year journey and we arrived at a very happy outcome. So I’m excited to talk about, “Well, let me show you the very ugly, very first deck we ever built.” So we had this conversation about Rock, Paper, Scissors, and I knew there was something there because we were talking about players playing — my fundamental premise behind all game design is games should not be entertaining. Games should make the players entertaining. And suddenly, when you said, “Rock, Paper, Scissors over time,” I was like, “Oh, that’s perfect.” But three tools, rock, paper and scissors, not a very robust tool set. We can’t really play a game that way. So I ran home and started scribbling on cards. These are just blank cards. I took Sharpies, I buy these by the thousands on Amazon. So I had a ton of these and we just started scribbling. And so we made a card that says rock, and we made a card that says paper, and we made a card that says scissors. And we thought, “What if we’re all on the same team? But what if these cards here are not tools to fight with each other? What if these are a challenge that we have to all solve together?” And so we started just putting down a bunch of things, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. And we’re like, “All right, we’ll sit around the table and we’ll all just do this pattern. Everyone do scissors. Now everyone do paper. Now everyone do rock.” Tim Ferriss: And we’d been talking about these different variations and ideas on the walk and then we ended up back at your dining room table — Elan Lee: Yeah, that’s right. Tim Ferriss: — with tons — Elan Lee: Seriously scribbling. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, scribbling and modifying cards as we went. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. So now the modifiers are really the most interesting thing. Because the game that I’m describing right now is useless. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: We can all do scissors and then all do paper. Who cares, right? There’s nothing here. But now we have a baseline. We’re all going to do this thing. Cool, easy. And then we started doing these modifiers, all players do all blue cards. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: So we start scribbling rock, paper, scissors in different colors, and then we’ve got this modifier. So now everyone’s going to — sorry, I’m going to do scissors, but then we’re all going to do paper and then back to you just doing rock, and things like that. And so then it was like, “Okay, well, skip a player after every red card. Okay, shout every blue card,” right? Then we just started writing all these crazy modifiers. I’m just putting all these cards all over the table because the challenge got more and more interesting. And then it was like, “Okay, so something interesting is possible here. Now what if instead of just splashing cards all over the paper, what if we were responsible for this? What if one at a time everyone had to add a new card to the table to make this challenge harder and harder and harder?” And that’s when we started talking about the vocabulary of this game. What are these cards? What makes this thing harder? Rock and paper and scissors very quickly got eliminated from the game because they’re so boring. So we started talking about, “Well, okay, what if you’re making a peace sign?” And then you came up with, “Well, what if you pose a ballerina on a card? And what if you slap the shoulder or the person next to you on a card? And what if you have to — ” I remember one of our earliest notes was, “Eliminate all shouting cards,” because that was no fun at all. Tim Ferriss: We tested that. And then that got all old real quick. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: And also as we’re play testing, right? As we’re inventing mechanics and testing different things. So we play for a few rounds being like, “Okay, that was okay, but what do you guys think of this?” “Okay, we like this aspect.” “Great, let’s make four more of those cards of different colors.” And then we played again. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then we played again. And then we’d iterate and we played again. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And we ended up with, I mean, spreadsheets full of different cards. And this is all still now in cooperative mode at that point. Elan Lee: All in cooperative mode. Tim Ferriss: And — Elan Lee: But over the next week, I would say we designed 80 percent of the game. We were at this stalled-at-one-percent mode for months. And then in a matter of days, 80 percent done. Because we found this every time we played some version of this, the immediate answer when we were done playing was, “Let’s go again.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So is that the litmus test for you? Elan Lee: For sure. Tim Ferriss: I mean in terms of the indicators that something is worth further development, right? Elan Lee: Yeah,. Tim Ferriss: Because you have 400 in your notebook and so you’re not going to develop all of those. What are some of the — could be a water feel that you have, but what are some of the indicators where you’re like, “Oh, okay.” Elan Lee: So there’s two things to talk about here. Certainly “Let’s play again” is a great one, but to set your mind in a place where you’re willing to say, “Imagine this, but tweaked, but something a little different.” There’s this principle I love called the zero effect. Zero effect. Tim Ferriss: Zero effect? Elan Lee: Yeah, zero effect. It’s from a movie, I think, in the late ’80s, early ’90s, somewhere around there called Zero Effect. And there’s this one scene where they explain what the zero effect is. And it is as follows, if you’ve lost your car keys and you’re looking for your car keys, here you are in your living room, you’re looking for car keys, the chances of you finding your car keys are very low because there’s so many things in this room that are not your car keys. So your chances of finding that one thing very, very low. If instead you are trying to find anything, your chances of success are suddenly at a hundred percent. You will find something, as long as you don’t care what it is that you found. That’s my favorite premise for brainstorming and for early testing. Don’t lock in your head, “I’m looking for this particular thing. I must find X. I must find X.” Because the chances that you’re going to find that thing are almost non-existent. But if you can keep your brain open and say, “I’m just looking for something. I don’t care what it is, something, anything, and I’ll tweak it later, I’ll play with it later. I’ll find some way to consider this thing I found my car keys.” As long as you’re willing to make that leap, brainstorming becomes a pleasure. Tim Ferriss: And does that take the form of, “What if, blah?” “What if we blah?” “What if this card did blah?” Elan Lee: Precisely. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is it a series of what ifs? Elan Lee: And you’re not scared for all of those to fail, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because you can come up with those all day long. And that’s what we did, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Over the next few days, that process, “What if, blah. Let’s try it. What if, blah, let’s try it. What if, whatever, let’s try it.” And as long as the answer is always, “Let’s try it,” you will a hundred percent find what you’re looking for. Tim Ferriss: All right, so let’s make some recommendations for people listening or watching. What books or resources would you recommend for people who are interested in game development? Now, I want to reiterate also, whether you think you’re playing games or not, you’re already playing games in life. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So for me, this is a way of putting on a table what we’ve already implicitly agreed to in our own lives in ways that we generally don’t realize, which is we’re all playing games. Now what does that mean? That means that beyond Maslow’s basic rungs on the ladder, shelter, warmth, food, et cetera, at some point, particularly as adults, maybe it’s before you go to school, maybe it’s when you’re in college, but you have decided to play or you have just ended up drafting into a game with certain rules, certain conditions for winning or losing certain ranking mechanisms. And step number one is figuring out what games you’re playing. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So I would suggest that learning about building games helps you to put on x-ray vision glasses, where you start to see the world is comprised of tons of games. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s so true. And you start to dive deeper into game theory. What is the prisoner’s dilemma? What is a zero sum game? If you can start to identify those very fundamental game design concepts in the real world, you can jump to the end of a conversation so much faster. You can avoid so many missteps because everything follows, within reason, everything follows game design principles because this practice, this art form has been so well studied and so well researched and so well documented that you get to take advantage of all of that. And I love that. I use that for my relationships. I use that as playing with my kids. I use that at work all the time. It’s just there’s these fundamental principles of game design. And I’ll talk about a book I’d love that illustrates them. But, yeah, they can be applied to anything. You’re right, you’re playing a game all the time. And the first step is to be aware that you are playing a game. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: All right, so I’ve got two books. Tim Ferriss: Let’s hear it. Elan Lee: One is, let’s see, A Theory of Fun by Raph Koster. Raph Koster? Raph Koster? R-A-P-H, Raph. It’ll outline all these fundamentals. It is the first game design book I ever read. It is the one I go back to and refer to the most often. It’s just got everything and the author is brilliant and go read that book. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: The second one is going to be a little controversial. Tim Ferriss: Memoirs of a Geisha? Elan Lee: It’s called Don’t Shoot the Dog. Tim Ferriss: Oh, this is an exceptional book. Elan Lee: Exceptional book. It is by Karen Pryor. Tim Ferriss: It is not explicitly about game design, at all. Elan Lee: It is not at all about game design. But here’s the thing, this book, the fundamental premise of this book is you are trying to teach a companion, a dog, to behave in a certain way. And the answer to how best to do that is not to, when things go wrong at least, not to blame the dog, is to fundamentally change the way you operate and the way you convey information and the way you look at the world in order to better relate to your dog and to the way that the dog understands and sees the world. It is the best game design principle I have ever encountered in my life. And true, it has nothing to do with game design, but when you’re designing a game, you’re designing it for a target, for someone who isn’t you and you’re not even going to be in the room when they encounter it. And to have in your brain from the very first step, “Every problem that comes up is my problem, not theirs. Every responsibility is my responsibility, not theirs.” And if you can get that in your head and design games that way, those are the games I have found that are the most successful. Tim Ferriss: This is Don’t Shoot the Dog, terrible title, but it is the fundamental starting point that I recommend to anyone who’s interested in dog training. And Karen Pryor is one of the popularizers of clicker training as a way of shaping behavior. I believe she had experience with marine mammals, which by the way, you can’t whack on the butt with a newspaper to punish them, so in other words, negative reinforcement. So how do you do it? You use positive reinforcement. You use clickers or whistles or different tools. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I believe the back of the book, people will be able to fact-check this, but it basically says whether you want to get your dog to heel, your cat to stop laying on the kitchen table, or your mother-in-law to stop nagging you, the principles are all the same. And at the end of it, like you said, is this radical ownership of “It may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility.” Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And in a lot of cases, certainly with game design and instructions and so on, it is actually your fault. If people are confused, it is your fault. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, but it’s the best way. Before I started Exploding Kittens, I designed games for friends and I just had the hardest time. When I wasn’t in the room, people were not enjoying those games. And it was only once I read that book that I realized the fault is absolutely mine. Because I’m trying to get them to have as much fun as I want them to have and the fact that they’re not, I keep blaming them. And that’s so wrong. Tim Ferriss: So what did you do? How did you fix that? Elan Lee: There’s basically two parts. One starts with design. One says the game has to be so simple that it is almost self-correcting. And I have to strip out all complication, I have to remove all nuance. Any time I’m thinking of the rules and I say, “Okay, if this happens, then this happens, except if — ” The moment I say “except,” I’ve gone down a wrong path. I need to get rid of all of that stuff. That was the first part. And then the second part is in writing the actual instructions and figuring out how — if I’m sitting in the room, you’re going to get this game because I’m going to explain it and I’m going to be enthusiastic. And when you ask a question, I’m going to answer the question. And when you get confused, I’m going to clarify it. I can a hundred percent do that. But a piece of paper trying to do that same thing, I have to write it as if I’m in the room and I have to anticipate those questions and I have to cut them off before they come up and I have to correct behavior because I know exactly where you’re going to go off course and fix it in the instructions. And that kind of one-two punch changed my game design from like 10 percent of the people get this to 95 percent of the people get this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, one aspect — I mean there’s so many aspects, but one aspect of this that I enjoyed was related to the instructions. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so number one, you make it really clear in the instructions, which we both poured over ad nauseum. But reading is the worst way to learn a game. Go watch this video, QR code. So that’s number one. But if you’re going to put it into text — and I think I’m pretty good at this, but I was very impressed with your ability to identify anything that could be misunderstood or that wasn’t yet defined or that could be taken with another more broader connotation that would steer people off course. And the number of edits in that Google Doc. Elan Lee: I mean, it’s got to be in the hundreds, right? Tim Ferriss: From all of us, hundreds and hundreds of edits. Elan Lee: So the most important skill is you will write better instructions, you will convey information to people better if you can clear your mind. If you can approach any set of instructions from the perspective of the things I know I do not yet know, and the words that come out of my mouth have to not only fill my brain with the required knowledge — Tim Ferriss: I see basically beginner’s mind, right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Putting yourself in the place of someone who has never seen this before. Elan Lee: Exactly. And it’s so hard to do because you have this information in your head. It must be there, otherwise you’re not going to be able to explain the thing. But to back all the way up and say, “I’m just going to split my brain in two. There’s this one reading script and I know the information I have to get out, but the other half is the recipient of that script and it knows nothing.” If you can do that — and it’s so hard, it takes so much practice. If you can do that, you’re going to not only be able to design good games and write good instructions, but you’re also going to be able to just converse more effectively just out in the world in general. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. All right. You mentioned I think it was two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What other golden or guiding tenets do you have for yourself when you’re doing game design within Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: Oh, good question. If a component does not need to be in the game, remove it from the game. Tim Ferriss: Right. So an example of that would be we had these chits or little chips, like poker chips. Elan Lee: Like bingo chips. Tim Ferriss: Like bingo chips that we were using for lives or strikes, and turns out you don’t need that. You can use — Elan Lee: Yeah, because you’ve got a whole thing of cards right here, just use those. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You can use cards by flipping them over and using the back of the card. Elan Lee: Exactly. That’s a perfect example. Right? We have this thing where we’re like, “Hey, you know what would be fun is if everybody had a big hand of cards and we’re going to play cards and you make decisions.” I’m like, “I get that.” Most games you play, you have a hand of cards and you’re going to play a card and you’re making a decision. That’s awesome. But you know what? That’s a private moment and you reveal a card. Every game you’ve ever played. When you play UNO, you’ve got a hand of cards, you’re making a decision, you play a card, you’ve revealed what card you just played. And I remember thinking, “Is there a simpler version of that?” And it turns out there is. And the simpler version in Coyote is take some cards, put them all face up on the table, and then decide which one you’re going to pick. That’s very similar to having a deck of cards, but now it’s public. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s public. Elan Lee: Right? Tim Ferriss: And also when the competitive version was brought in, which is the way that I like to play, the way I would suggest people play, but you can warm up with cooperative or if you have somebody in your life or in your family who just cannot lose without creating a huge pain in the ass, then the cooperative mode is really fun. But the competitive mode then allows the group decision on which card to play potentially, although ultimately that’s individual. That has implications for cooperative when it’s public. But also for competitive. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: There are a number of tweaks made to this, but I mentioned earlier, sabotaging. So we had competitive, but different minds are wired for different games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so, God forbid, what happens to you is what happened to one of my employees who was play testing this, where one of the people in the group was a mathematician who also is high-level chess player if I remember correctly. Elan Lee: Oh, no. Tim Ferriss: And he just smoked everyone because he had the mind for it. Elan Lee: Yeah, of course. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what do you do for that? Well, we ended up — and this took a lot of play testing to ultimately land on this. And I want to ask you about play testing, particularly if it’s kind of hands off the wheel and you have people playing the game without you. Elan Lee: Yeah, terrifying Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Realized — and this comes back to the underdog being able to win, not getting my ass smoked in Magic over and over again by someone who’s just got better hardwiring for it. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: And that’s where the attack cards came from. Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So there are these attack cards in the deck, which to the simplification side, you can play in cooperative mode to modify a card. I don’t want to get too in the weeds. Elan Lee: Well, I want to give you more credit for this because I don’t think you’re taking enough credit. All right, let me phrase this a different way. So the basic premise of the game is we have a whole bunch of activities on the table, right? Ballerina, peace sign, whatever it is, thumbs up, thumbs down, smile, frown. Tim Ferriss: Lean and make a fart noise. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly, lean and make a fart noise. So we’ve got all these things that we’re all going to do. And then on top of that — Tim Ferriss: It’s a fan favorite. Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s such a good card. On top of that, we have all these modifier cards and they modify — you have to skip a player after this one, ignore this card, do this one twice. Tim Ferriss: Those are generally the Coyote cards. Elan Lee: The Coyote cards. And you had this great idea, you said, “Because some players are naturally gifted at this game, far more so than others, and because some players are going to naturally fall behind and they need a way to sabotage the first place.” If you’re in last place, you need a way to sabotage the first place player. If you’ve ever played Mario Kart, you know this feeling very well. And you said, “What if we took some of these modifiers, every time — all players have to do all the blue cards with one hand instead of two.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But what if instead of all the blue — Tim Ferriss: Or Tyrannosaurus arms. Elan Lee: Or Tyrannosaurus arms, you have to do all your movements with Tyrannosaurus arms. What if instead of playing that on all blue cards on the table, what if you just put that, slide it right in front of another player and now only they have to do it? For every single one of their turns. You’ve put a curse on them. The last place player has attacked the first place player. And I remember thinking, “Tim, you’re like a natural game designer.” That’s such a nice moment and it’s such an easy modification. And of course my answer was, “I don’t know, let’s try it.” And then we tried it and it was glorious. And I love moments like that for two reasons. One is because you had learned at that point to speak like a game designer. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Instead of saying, “I think we just need to sabotage people,” instead you said, “Some people are really good at this game. We have to address that. Some people are naturally bad at this game. We need to give them a tool.” And those terms, speaking in that language, armed with that vocabulary, suddenly the answer to you became so clear, like, “Here’s how we solve those problems.” That’s great. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: I guarantee you would not have been capable of that when we started this process. Tim Ferriss: No way. Yeah, no, I wouldn’t have had the — sometimes artists talk about the visual library, just the exposure to different types of artwork, different forms, different silhouettes, different structures so that they can pull from that visual library to inform whatever they’re trying to build or solve for. And it’s the same with game design, same with everything. You need to build your ABCs so you can convey what you’re trying to say in terms that are solvable, if that makes any sense. Elan Lee: Yeah. Totally. You’re a quick study too. Tim Ferriss: Helped getting the books that you recommended. All right, so I’m not going to dox my friend in question. But as long-term listeners will know, I was, in a former life, a neuroscience major and then, in the last 10 years, have funded a lot of science. I always have just had this hankering and this dream of being involved in neuroscience; it continues to this day. And in the process of building this game — and this is not how I necessarily sell it, because this is going to sound terrible, but through many experiments with different companies and so on, I’ve concluded that even though generally Americans, I’ll throw it on Americans, I’m American, say they want to be smarter, they will typically not pay for something that is designed to make them smarter unless it’s a magic pill, and then sometimes the answer is yes. But what I was hoping to also do with this game is to create something that would — and this has not been proven, there’s no randomized controlled study examining this, although that might change at some point. — is to design something that would help those players who are not good at this, or the people who are in the middle of the bell curve or the people who are good to get better. And for people who are interested in looking at some — they’re not perfect analogs, but they’re similar. People can check out the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST. It’s a neurophysiological test used to assess cognitive flexibility in executive functions, particularly the ability to shift cognitive sets and learn from feedback. All right, so participants must sort cards based on an initially unknown rule, which changes after a certain number of correct sorts. Now this is not a perfect parallel because that does not, in and of itself, make for a fun game. Right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: So fun number one, lots of probably rank ordered like one, two, three, four, five. But could I also Trojan horse in — Elan Lee: Yeah, love it. Tim Ferriss: — cognitive training. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I think the answer — this is from a lay perspective, and obviously I’m biased because I’m involved in every step, I’m making this thing, but I think it does the trick. And what people will notice is, and you know this too, the game starts off so easy. Elan Lee: There’s nothing to it. Tim Ferriss: And people are like, “There’s nothing to it.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then once a modifier or two comes out, people are like, “Oh, oh, wait a second, this is getting really tricky.” And if, for instance, I’ve had lifelong insomnia, you want to sleep better, play this game before you go to bed. And by the end you will feel like you just did a workout, a full brain workout for your cognition. Elan Lee: You know what I love about that part? I learned to play the drums years and years ago, and I remember I would learn these new patterns and it was like your right hand has to do this and your left hand has to do this, and your right leg has to do this and your — and I remember thinking, “No way, no way. I can’t do that.” And you work at it and you work at it and you work at it and suddenly it starts to click, just a little bit. Like, “Oh, my right hand did the right thing.” And it’s like you can feel new neurons coming to life. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Your brain is doing something that five minutes ago you could not do. This is the first game I’ve ever played that does that exact same thing. And I remember the first time I felt that way in a very early play test, my eyes got all wide and I was like, “There is something magical going on here. I know I’m psyching myself out, but I feel new things happening in my brain because five minutes ago I could not do this pattern and now I can. We can go all the way around the table and you can add a new card and I will still be able to do this pattern that I couldn’t do just five minutes ago.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. And what’s cool as well is you get to see just how specialized certain minds are and where you might have an Achilles heel. So for instance, and this is true for some folks, we have the modifiers ranked by difficulty just so you can — because ultimately with Coyote, you’re in charge of how hard you make the game. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. That’s right. That’s right. Tim Ferriss: You are in full charge of how easy, moderate, or difficult you make it. And we didn’t even talk about how this game is designed to make you a game designer. We’ll talk about that with the blank cards. But this is a sort of creativity unlock as much as a game. That’s the intention behind it, which is part of the reason that I’m really excited to see what the hell it does when it’s released into the wild, which effectively is now. Elan Lee: That’s going to — Tim Ferriss: Now the specialization piece, I’ll just speak to that. So for instance, for me, skipping turns, skipping players, it is a blind spot. It is an Achilles heel for me. That’s true for quite a few folks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But for other people, for instance, if we’re going around the table, most people would be familiar with “We Will Rock You.” Elan Lee: “We Will Rock You,” yeah. Tim Ferriss: So it’s like boom, boom, boom, boom. So the way you play the game is you go around is you go “Boom, boom,” and you can hit the table with your hands. You can do it with closed fists. You could probably clap it if you want, but it’s boom, boom. And then one person does the move. Like let’s take the ballet, we’re going to do a pirouette. You have to do the motion and you have to say the motion. So then these two things can be split or confused later. We want to get — Elan Lee: We’ll get to that later. Tim Ferriss: — too deep into that. And then it’s boom, boom, next person, boom, boom, next person. And it goes around. And then it just gets more and more complicated. So I remember when we were first experimenting with the modifier that said, okay, it’s now three bumps instead of two. So it’s boom, boom, boom. And then the move. And there were, I remember, I’m not going to call them out, but there’s one person who just could not do it. Elan Lee: I know. I was one of those people. My brain would start melting out of my ears at that point. I don’t know why though. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. It’s weird. It’s weird. So they’re very specific. You’ll find each person will have a super strength and a super weakness, and you’ll figure it out by playing this game. And just from a game design perspective also, I’d love to hear you talk about finding the sweet spot. I mean, we could talk about Bushnell’s law of Atari fame, the game, I’m paraphrasing here, but a good game is easy to learn and difficult to master. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But how do you, in the course of play testing, working with prototypes find the sweet spot of difficulty? Because with this game, well, through making this game, I’ve just really come to appreciate how hard it is to create a game where people experience that sweet spot. Because if you were to take Coyote and make it too easy, what a simple game to make. Elan Lee: Sure. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you wanted to make it basically impossible and not fun to play, also very easy. But to find that sweet spot on the graph is incredibly challenging. Elan Lee: Yeah. So the way I think about this is when you first encounter any game, the first thought that has to go into your brain is, “I can do that.” You hear it described, and you have to think, “I can do that.” And then you have to try the game and that has to be reinforced. The game has to say, “Yep, you can do that.” And you have to feel like, “Okay, I thought I could do it. I can do it. This is great.” But that’s only going to last a few seconds. The next thought that has to go into your brain is, “I understand the path to mastery. I understand how to get better at this.” And then the next thought is, “And I can do that too.” So you have to see the moment a modifier card comes out, or the moment any complication happens in your favorite game, it has to stop you dead in your tracks. It has to be like, “Ooh, the thing I just did to start the game and was really good at, I thought I could do it. I could do it. That’s not going to work here. I have to rethink my strategy, or I have to get better at something else.” And then those two follow-up thoughts have to show up in quick succession: “I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And that’s really the art to me of that ramping up of game design. And you have to keep hitting that “I think I can do that”; “Yes, you can. Now you can’t anymore, but you know what you have to do and you can do that too.” And then that’s going to get blocked. And you think, “Okay, now what? Now I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And you have to just keep hitting those two things. And it’s rinse and repeat over and over and over again. And if you can hit that, you are just holding somebody’s hand from the beginning of the game to the end of the game. And they’re going to get great at it, they’re going to achieve that sense of mastery over time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and if you, listening or watching, have any game that you consider simple that you enjoy, rest assured there was an absurd, absurd amount of development and testing and revising that went into it. And just to give you an example, this is by all outward appearance a very simple game. And the three to eight players you could probably play with more, 10 minutes, says age is 10 plus. I’ve seen people playing with their kids who are much younger and it’s actually hilarious and super fun. There are so many levers you can pull here. You have the action cards, which are these cute little salamander cards with the different motions and gestures and so on. You’ve got just the sheer number of cards. How many variants do you have? How many total cards do you have? How many Coyote versus attack cards? When you have a fully shuffled deck, what does that actually look like? There’s so many different variables that you have to think through. Elan Lee: Yeah. And we even set up, one of my favorite things is we’re starting to see people compete now. So we set up this page of, here are table configurations. Here’s an array of cards in exactly this order with exactly these modifiers. This one’s hard, this one’s impossible. This one is going to kill you. And we’ve started to see, the game is barely available so far, but we started to see some people try to tackle those challenges. Tim Ferriss: Oh, fun. Okay. I didn’t even know that. Elan Lee: It’s incredible. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so where this came from also is in The 4-Hour Chef a million years ago, came out in 2012, which was actually a book about accelerated learning, confusingly. But putting that aside, there were a few recipes in that book. I think one was called Dragon Force Chaconne or something like that, which was named after this video game track that people found impossible to play on guitar. And then there was something, a La Ancienne, which was this just ludicrously complex French dish that involved fish. And I was like, okay, look, if you’ve done everything up to this point and you want to take a quantum leap forward and try something that is considered effectively impossible by most people, here you go. And so that’s what we created on this particular page. Elan Lee: I will just say, having tested all of the challenges on that page, I can do exactly one of them. The last two are so hard. Tim Ferriss: They really are. Elan Lee: And we’ve already seen someone, a table of six people succeed — Tim Ferriss: Oh, wow. Okay — Elan Lee: — at the middle one. They’ve already done it. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts. Elan Lee: Yeah. I’ve never seen anyone do the crazy hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But it’s coming. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So people can check it out. And there may or may not be a bunch of excitement around that. So I will just say there may be incentives later to be good at this game. I will leave it at that for now. So I tell you what, we’re going to come back to some of the blank cards and we’ll talk about those features. But let’s talk about a bit more of the process of making any game. We could talk about Coyote specifically of course, because you have a process for this. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How many games per year do you guys put out on average? Elan Lee: So it’s funny, I actually built this out as a graph. So our first year we did one, our second year we did two. Our third year we did two again. Last year we did 14. This year we’ll do 23, I think. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s a lot. But we’ve built this, it’s really fun, we’ve built this incredibly robust pipeline from design all the way through to testing and then sales and then marketing. And I feel obligated to just keep that pipeline full because it’s such a beautiful thing we built. So we do a lot of games. Tim Ferriss: All right, let’s get some info that we wouldn’t normally have any access to. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: If you do an 80/20 analysis, it’s not going to be exactly 80/20, but you get where I’m going, on your best-selling games, what’s on the leaderboard? What are the top X number of games? Five, three, four, whatever the number. Elan Lee: Well, up until last year, number one, the top-selling game in the world amongst all games was Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts, man. Elan Lee: It’s nuts. Tim Ferriss: Congratulations. Elan Lee: It makes no sense, but I’ll tell you something I’m even more proud of. It’s now number two. Number one is a game called Hurry Up Chicken Butt. Hurry Up Chicken Butt is a game I designed with my four-year-old daughter, and she did most of the design. And it is outselling Exploding Kittens. It is selling one game every four seconds. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s nuts. And it was designed by a four-year-old. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so we’ve got a Hurry Up Chicken Butt, Exploding Kittens. Elan Lee: Yeah. The next few spots in the global sales are constantly shifting. Everybody’s fighting for those, but we always have — our entries into that list, which are constantly shifting, Poetry for Neanderthals is usually number three. Throw Throw Burrito is usually either number five or six, and the rest are just totally random. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Okay, got it. So what has made Hurry Up Chicken Butt a success? Elan Lee: Yeah. So remember what I said, if you have the best design game in the world — Tim Ferriss: And by the way, when we spoke I think two years ago — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — you were just beginning to talk about this. I don’t think it had launched at that point. Elan Lee: No, it hadn’t. Yeah. Yeah. It has been an absolute rocket ship. Tim Ferriss: What are the magic ingredients? Why has it worked? Because not all games do that. Elan Lee: Yeah. No, they don’t. Tim Ferriss: And you’ve had now, with the number of games that EK, Exploding Kittens, has developed, you’ve had a chance to see a lot of different ideas come through the doors and go out the doors. Elan Lee: Yeah. Some games last a season, some games last a decade. So when I was designing games — okay, so Hurry Up Chicken Butt in particular, I wrote a list of the things I wanted that game to accomplish. And my daughter had all these ideas, “Here’s what I want to do, and you’re going to do this and you’re going to run up and jump up and down and blah.” But I had a list of things that I needed to know were in this game in order for me as a parent to buy it for my kid. And they were as follows. The game has to be as much fun for me to play as it is for my daughter. That’s a hard one. Tim Ferriss: That’s hard. Elan Lee: That killed most designs that we came up with. Number two, my daughter has to be able to beat me at this game, even though I’m not letting her win. Holy crap is that a hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: Number three, the game cannot have any losers. It can have a winner, but it cannot have any losers. Those three were my guiding lights. It was like, I need to check off these three check boxes for this game to be good. And we worked on a hundred million designs. She’s great. She’ll just be like, “Oh, you don’t like this one? Here’s another one. You don’t like that one? Here’s another one.” And she just kept firing them off. And we finally got to this game that hit all three of those. That, as I said earlier, is only half the battle. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that’s the necessary, but not sufficient — Elan Lee: Exactly. So now we have a game that I’m in love with, that we play every single night that she can beat me at regularly. And I am trying my absolute hardest to beat her. And this four-year-old is kicking my ass at this game. Love that. Love it. And I’m having a blast. Tim Ferriss: So this is my first time hearing about these criteria. Just for people listening, this is all new to me. Elan Lee: When my daughter got old enough to start playing games right around when she turned four, we went out and bought all these games and I just hated them. They were so boring and I hated playing. And so we just designed our own. We just made them better. And it was important for me to have that list. ‘Cause unless I know what success looks like, I’ll just stay in brainstorming mode forever. So I made that list, finally hit it, and then we entered into part two. And here my daughter has very little to do with it. Here’s where I sit down with the marketing and sales team and I was like, “What the hell are we going to call this thing?” And we went through a thousand different names. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know the feeling. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we did that. But once I had 10 names that I really liked, we sat down with my daughter and all her friends and I would just read them off. And there was no contest. I got to Hurry Up Chicken Butt and they’re like just laughing hysterically, jumping up and down. They didn’t even want to hear the rest of the names. I was like, okay. Sold. So that was a really nice step forward. It was like, I know I’ve got a game that’s just fire for kids. They’re just so excited about this. And the next thing was, all right, well what do we make this box look like? And I was like, I know it has to be — the game itself involves a character and a die shaker and some sound effects. It’s got all this stuff packed into this character, this chicken. And I was like, I can’t just hide that. I have to put that in a box where you can see it. And that was really hard. The difference between box design for an iPhone and a game is an iPhone will spend a hundred dollars on that box with the materials and making it beautiful. And when you open your iPhone, you take the box and you throw it away. In a game, you’ve got about 40 cents to spend on the box and it has to last forever. It sucks. The equation is totally backwards, but I needed a thing that displayed the chicken and told you it made noise and lets you shake around the die and still hold its structure as a box so that you could remove this thing, play with it, and then reinsert it into the box in a way that isn’t going to mess with the integrity of the box — its structural integrity. So that was really hard, but we finally solved that. And then — Tim Ferriss: Did you do that before or after you started testing the waters with retailers? Elan Lee: After. Tim Ferriss: After? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. I don’t want to hijack, but whenever it makes sense, I would love to know how, at what point you start testing the waters with Elan Lee: Well, we do this backwards. And when we started, you have to do it the opposite way. You have to walk into those sales pitches and you have to say, “Here’s the final product. Look how beautiful it is. You don’t have to trust us that this is going to sell. You can look at this thing and know that it’s going to sell.” For this game, luckily, because we have a really good track record, we walked in with no box. All I walked in with was a rough idea, a name scribbled on a piece of paper. And I said, “Trust me, this is going to be great. We’re going to solve everything. It’s going to be amazing.” And they said, “Okay, yeah, sold. Let’s buy it.” That comes from 10 years of pitching them hit after hit after hit. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So if it were earlier in Exploding Kittens’ existence, you go in with the finished box. Elan Lee: Yeah. They’re never taking a flyer on that. Tim Ferriss: Who creates the finished box? Do you guys create it in-house? How do you prototype something like that? Elan Lee: Yeah, we have an incredible team. We have a large scale printer. We print on actual cardboard. We have a paper folder so we can actually build the boxes. Which was an investment, that’s not off-the-shelf machinery, but it helps — okay, so look, normally whatever manufacturer you’re working with, they send you a prototype box. Because they make it and they want you to see the final product and that’s what you go into the sales meetings with. You say, “Look, here’s the box. Here’s how much it’s going to weigh. Here’s the final presentation. We’ve been working on it for a year and a half. Here it is.” I walk into those meetings like, “I got an idea, I’ve been working on it for three weeks. I want you to buy it right now. I don’t have any materials to show you.” So it’s a different kind of pitch that I’m very proud of because I’ve earned that and we haven’t ever let them down. Tim Ferriss: So in the case of Coyote, there was a lot of play testing that was done before we ended up in line review meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Wow. We skipped that whole part, didn’t we? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: So could you talk about your secret cabal of families? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Secret cabal of families. I love it. All right, so — Tim Ferriss: Another chapter for your memoir. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. That’s a good title there. So, okay, so here’s how most game companies test games. If you had partnered with a different games company, here’s what your experience would’ve been like. “All right, we got a game. We really like it. It’s really fun, lots of internal testing. Everyone’s on board. We now need external testing.” And they go to these market research groups and they pull strangers in and they sit in a room with a one-way mirror and they show the game and they play the game with people they don’t know and they order in some crappy catered lunch and they play the game and then they rate it on a scale of one to 10 and they fill out this form that’s like, “Here’s what I liked and here’s what I didn’t like and here’s what I would improve.” And then you get to watch those videos and they present you back all these forms and you get to make a determination. Okay. Nobody plays games like that. You don’t play games with strangers. When was the last time you played a board game with a stranger? Tim Ferriss: Can’t even remember. Elan Lee: It doesn’t happen. Right? The testing procedure that all these other companies go through is fundamentally flawed. They’re using a resource because it’s the only resource that exists. So I sat down, that’s what we did our first time. We went through one of those companies and they gave us all the results. And I looked at these results and I was like, oh, my God, we just burned $25,000 on this thing and it’s useless. So I realized at that moment, because nothing better exists, we’re going to have to build it ourselves. So I started reaching out to, at first our Kickstarter community and then our Discord community and then our Reddit community as we grow and grow and grow and said, “Look, I got a bunch of prototypes. I need families and friends who get together regularly to play games and I’m going to mail you a free game. You don’t even have to send it back to me, it’s yours forever. You get this amazing prototype. All I ask in return is upon receiving it within 24 hours, you play the game with your friends and family and you record the session and you send me that video. And that’s it. That’s all I want in return.” And within about 12 months, we had 400 families sign up for this thing. They are called our kiddie test pilots. And they’re this incredible group of enthusiastic game players that give us the best feedback. And we don’t have them fill out a questionnaire. All we ask them at the end of the test session, we say, “Look into the camera and answer one question. The only question we care about, do you want to play again?” And we know a game is ready when everybody looks into that lens and says, “Hell, yes!” And that’s it. That’s our testing process. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the pass/fail marks or green versus red signals that you look for? In other words, I imagine the response rate could vary, but you don’t know if that’s because people are busy or if it’s the wrong time of year or maybe they looked at the game, the box, and so on and it just didn’t sell them so they didn’t play it. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Is that something you pay attention to? Are the people, I’m sure I’m not the only person wondering this, if they’re part of this special VIP get free game group, are they disincentivized to say, “Hell no, I would not play this game again.” So do you get a false positive signal? Elan Lee: I see. Tim Ferriss: How do you think through what constitutes a thumbs up versus a thumb sideways versus a thumbs down? Elan Lee: Yeah. There are a lot of false positives for sure. And there’s no way I can solve that problem. We prompt them in advance. We’re like, “Look, we need honestly — this game will get great if you tell us that something’s broken with it. We need to know that.” And they’re motivated because we also send them the final version of the game. So they know that’s coming, they know a better version is coming if they help us make it better. So some of the problem is solved that way, but not all of it. So that’s why the video is so important. Tim Ferriss: So they say, “We had a great time,” and you’re watching and you’re like, they are not having a great time. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Look, count the number of eye rolls. Or you know a great one, they’ll take the instructions — I love this. They’ll open the instructions. And when you see that eyes go wide and they inhale. Tim Ferriss: Pull back and they’re like — Elan Lee: It’s like, “Oh, fuck.” Tim Ferriss: Instruction apnea. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. Elan Lee: Something, that’s terrible. Right? And that’s really important. And there’s no survey in the world they can fill out that’s going to tell me that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You need to watch the moment they see the instructions. Tim Ferriss: Because they may not even realize they’re doing it. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: So how are they going to report it? Elan Lee: Yeah. And that’s why the video is so important. And we have very specific instructions for the video. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, what are they? Because I’m wondering how in the hell do you review 400 videos? Elan Lee: Oh, well one, we watch them at 4X speed and two is we’ve got a whole team of people that watch them and they flag moments. They don’t even say why this moment is important. Something happened here, something happened here. I’m going to go on to the next video now. And then the next group of people will go through and look at those flags and say, “Oh, big, deep inhale. Rules confusion.” Tim Ferriss: Nerd question, what do you use software wise for flagging stuff? Elan Lee: Vimeo. Tim Ferriss: Vimeo, okay. So you have people upload their videos to Vimeo? Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Elan Lee: Yeah, so this whole process takes months and it’s really important. And the other thing is, I’ve got 400 test families, but I’m only going to send out five games at a time. The reason is I need to collect that feedback, make changes, and send out the next batch. Otherwise, I’ve got 10 results for a version and it’s useless. I know what the next five are going to be like ’cause I saw them on the first five. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So is it then, just to state my understanding, with the kiddie test pilots, you basically have — you’re not sending out the same version to 400, 600 people at once? Elan Lee: Five at a time. Tim Ferriss: Five at a time. And then you look at that cohort and see what comes back? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. It’s always the same stuff. Tim Ferriss: Then you tweak and then it goes out to the next group. Elan Lee: Yeah, the next five. Tim Ferriss: Over what period of time do you get a prototype to the max number who are going to receive it? Elan Lee: Usually I would say six to eight months. And we’re tweaking two things. One is we’re tweaking gameplay, but much more commonly we’re tweaking the instructions. Because gameplay has already survived internal testing. So we know the game is fun. If we know this game is fun and then we watch a video of people not having fun, chances are it’s the instructions, not the game. And so that’s what we start attacking at that moment. Tim Ferriss: Got it. What are some of the risks of internal testing? ‘Cause I’ve always wondered, for instance, when I have, as I’m doing right now, doing a bunch of writing and I have people proofreading or test reading my writing, I do not only do it with professional writers. I mean they’re very good and I know I’m very fortunate to know some amazing writers, but they’re also a little too close to the material. It’s like a travel writer who can’t stop looking at their travel experience through the lens of a writer. They have lost the ability to just travel and have fun. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the risks, if any, of internal testing? Elan Lee: So you and I have the same instinct here. I remember when we were testing this game internally, hadn’t gone out the door yet. Tim Ferriss: This game? Elan Lee: This game, Coyote. Yeah. I remember you would say, “Hey, can you show me test results? But can you have your accounting team test it instead of your game design team?” And I remember thinking, yeah, that’s what we do. I’m not interested in the game design team’s results. So I would show you the accounting team results and I would show you the sales people, the sales team’s results, who hadn’t even ever seen the game. Our internal testing starts out with the game design team, of course, but very quickly has to move on to the other teams, specifically the other teams who have never seen the game and don’t know the background. Because those are really the only tests that we care about. So your instinct is perfect there, and I’m very happy to say you didn’t have to teach us that, we already knew that part. Tim Ferriss: I mean, if I’m teaching you anything, I don’t know what it would be other than my obsessive focus on — I’m sorry for the volume of email and the volume of text messages and the volume of everything. Elan Lee: Every single one of those made the game better. Truly. Truly. I mean, okay, look, we’ve only done, we’ve done, I think two partnerships total. Three partnerships total. We did a game with Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller. We did a game with Jeff Probst of Survivor, and now we’ve done a game with Tim Ferriss. You probably sent more notes than the other two combined. Tim Ferriss: I sent a lot of notes. Sent a lot of notes. I really had a blast with it. And I remember this moment, and I’m wondering if this happened before or after the line review meetings. I think it might’ve been afterwards, but you could place it for me because this is my first game and I don’t put my name on anything. That was part of the very, very truthful pitch. It’s not like one of, I don’t have Tim Ferriss microwave enchiladas and Tim Ferriss sneakers. And then just as an aside, I have the Tim Ferriss game. It’s like, no, no, no, I don’t put my name on anything. So I take it very, very seriously. And I think it was, tell me if I’m getting this wrong, pretty sure it was Carly, who’s amazing. Elan Lee: Carly is the president of Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Carly is incredible. And because there’s always a fear, for me at least, where it’s like, maybe internally I think it’s great, and then it gets released into the wild and then, oh, shit there’s a real problem. Like Houston, we have a problem. Elan Lee: Yeah, and you can’t take it back. Tim Ferriss: Right. So what do you do? And I remember Carly, I want to say, sent a text to me. She was in, I want to say Germany at some type of gaming convention or meeting of distributors. I don’t remember the exact context, but she said Coyote was belle of the ball. She’s like, “You would not believe we had an entire huge room full of people playing, smashing on the tables over and over and over and over again.” And I was like, whew. Elan Lee: Yeah. Isn’t that a great feeling? Tim Ferriss: Okay, here we go, LFG. Elan Lee: She sent me a video of that. So just to set the stage there, there are 2,000 people that — sorry, there’s 2,000 people at this hotel of the 25 hotels that are part of this convention. And there’s one games room and there’s 10 tables in there. And the idea is there should be a different game at every table. And everyone’s testing out the games and sampling them. And we put Coyote on one table and almost immediately people started gathering around. And so those people said, “Can we just grab another copy and we’ll just put it on the next table just so not everyone has to gather around this one table?” ‘Cause it looked so intriguing. And so they sent it to another table. And then by the time Carly sent me a video, it was at every table in the room. It was just an entire hotel playing this one game because nobody wanted to play anything else. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Elan Lee: It was so neat. It was so neat. And how gratifying? We’ve been killing ourselves on this thing. And to see an audience receive it and say, thank you for the gift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. And also, I mean, I said it to you guys and look, it says technically it says age 10 plus. So I don’t want to contradict that, but if you’re willing to modify the rules, which is something that I encourage, and we have that in the instructions, house rules, feel free to modify the rules. But I sent you guys the video of my friend’s four-year-old after she played, which was like this — Elan Lee: So good! Tim Ferriss: It was such an amazing video. And this is the first thing I’ve ever done that can include families and kids directly/ Elan Lee: Easily. Tim Ferriss: Where it’s like, four-year-old, 10-year-old is not going to have any interest or necessarily the capacity to read one of my phone books that are like 600 pages long. It’s not going to happen. So this is also so much fun to finally now that it’s kind of released into the wild to start seeing these things bubbling up that I hoped would be there. Elan Lee: It’s the reason you make a game. You want to share an experience that then the recipients get to share with those people that they love. That’s why you make a game. That’s exactly what we’ve made here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So let’s talk about the selling process a little bit more. Because you said, there’s the game development, there’s building the game, there’s crafting the game. But there is an equally important part, which is how do you get this thing into people’s hands? And for that you need distribution. So this is going to be a callback. Remember that line review at the very beginning and then I took us on a very meandering path, but there was a point to it. How do you pitch big retailers? How does that happen? And how did you do it in the beginning of Exploding Kittens and how — I know it’s changed over time as you’ve built your track record, but nonetheless you still need to do it. And actually, here’s a data point that most people will never hear anyone talk about. What percentage of your sales are offline retail versus online? Elan Lee: Yeah. All right, we’ll start there. Yeah, we never share these numbers, but for you, Tim — Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: — here we go. 70 percent of our sales are in-person retail. Only 30 percent are online sales. Totally backwards than what you’d expect for almost any industry. But yeah, people like to walk into a store, they like to see and touch and feel the game and flip it over and read the back and compare it to the other games. And that’s where we sell our games. Which means not only do I need tremendous retail buy-in, those sales meetings are so important, those line reviews. But also the game has to sell itself on the shelf. When you’re walking down that games aisle, 70 percent of our audience does this. You need to look at all the game, hundreds of games, and you need to stop dead in your tracks on this one. And you need to say, “Ooh, what’s that?” And that starts at that line review, starts with getting them to say, not only are we going to commit to this game, but we’re going to put it in multiple locations. So you see it more than once. Very important. Also, we work with them to figure out the color scheme. And you and I, we did tons of surveys on the color scheme and the character and everything to stop people in their tracks. Tim Ferriss: So just a quick sidebar. I know I keep doing this, but some of you may remember, and for those who never heard it I’ll just tell you, from my very first book, 4-Hour Workweek, I used Google AdWords to test the top, let’s just call it 10 title and subtitle contenders. So I bid on keywords that were related to the subject matter in the book. And then the sponsored results, the ads were automatically split tested, like multivariate tested by Google. They will do this automatically. And then all of the URLs, I had different URLs for each title option. They just took people to an under construction page. Because I didn’t care about conversion, I cared about interest, sufficient interest click. And that is how I figured out the title. And then for the cover, back in the day, I went to Borders, which was on University Ave. in Palo Alto. And I had a counter, like you might see from a bouncer at the front of a club. And I put different covers onto a book of the same dimensions on the shelf. Elan Lee: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: I guess I didn’t tell you this. Under the new nonfiction. Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And I just, during the peak hours over a couple of days, I just tracked the number of times it got picked up. Elan Lee: Oh, that’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And then I used that to determine which cover to use. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. Tim Ferriss: Now there are better or certainly easier tools to use. So we ended up, there are a number of them, I’ll just mention a few. So we used PickFu, P-I-C-K-F-U.com. There’s also Intellivy, I-N-T-E-L-L-I-V-Y, and then there’s another one called Stickybeak also. But these allow you to do roughly the same thing, which is you can take, for instance, with this box design or any type of art, or you could probably do it with copy, many different things. You can survey people who fit a particular demographic. And so you could identify whatever the ages, the gender, if they are members of a particular service, whether they have Prime membership or this membership or that membership. You can fine slice it however you want, and then you can serve up variants. So for this coyote who you see on the cover, I’ll explain for the people, basically the box looks like a slightly enlarged box for a deck of cards and then the top of the box is this beautiful autumnal orange, almost a saffron, like Buddhist robe. Elan Lee: We spent so much time on this color. Tim Ferriss: We spent so much time on this, it is impossible to overstate how much time I spent on this and everybody spent on it. Then there’s this beautiful lime green. I remember taking photographs of particular leaves at particular times of the year with light coming through it to identify the hexadecimal or Pantone numbers for this particular grain. Elan Lee: Oh, I remember this well, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you remember it, you remember it. And then looking at color theory and the color wheel and, oh, my God, it went on and on. But above the coyote which is in the center of the box, there is this upper portion of a cartoon coyote’s head and very much trickster. Where it ended up is there’s a little hat on the coyote, there’s an earring, there’s a wink and the snout is where it’s cut off so you don’t see the nose. And this was originally, I remember sketching this initially on a Zoom call by pen and paper and then holding it up to the Zoom call to the camera and then later sending the scan and then we worked from there. But we had variants with no hat, we had variants with no earring, we had variants with both eyes open looking to camera, so to speak, we had both eyes open looking in one direction off to the side and we were able to very quickly get a very good statistical signal on what people preferred. Elan Lee: Yes. However — Tim Ferriss: However. Elan Lee: — to your credit, when you showed me that character, I think, initially, both the coyote’s eyes were open and we had some questions about the hat and I remember asking you all these questions. “What do you think of a wink? What do you think of an earring? What do you think of a hat? What do you think of one eye closed? With both eyes closed? What do you think? What do you think?” And to your credit, your answer was always “Let’s test it. I don’t want to have an opinion about this, I do have an opinion but I don’t even want to tell you, let’s test it.” And that is such an intelligent way to approach this. And ultimately, this beautiful character that we ended up with was so clearly the winner, it wasn’t even close. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it wasn’t even close. And so we were able to get this very strong signal from thousands of people voting and, boom, here we are. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, we were talking about the road to retail. So it’s 70 percent of your sales are in-person retail versus online. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. Tim Ferriss: And, therefore, the stakes are high for these line reviews. Elan Lee: Yeah, line reviews are a big deal. And I remember, so we really wanted to all show up in person. I remember you were trying so hard to get — our first line review was with Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas. I remember you wanted so badly to be there and there was some scheduling conflict that just wasn’t going to let it happen. And we tried to change the date but, again, they’ve got so many meetings and you’ve got to get in in exactly this time and they couldn’t change it to anything appropriate. And I remember thinking, “Oh, we’re sunk, I don’t know how to sell this game without Tim there in the room showing how much passion he has.” And you had a great solve, you just recorded a video of all that passion and you sat down in front of the camera and you just riffed on the game. You were just like, “Here’s why I love this, here’s why this is important to me, here’s why I made this game, first time I put my name on a thing,” and you recorded this beautiful and passionate video. And I remember walking into the line review and sitting down and saying, “I have a new game. First thing I’m going to do is we’re going to play this game and I’m not going to tell you anything about it, we’re just going to play this game.” And I set up the game and, within five minutes, they’re laughing and they’re having this incredible time and they’re like, “Oh, this is amazing, this is so much fun. How are you going to sell this thing?” And I said, “I’m going to play a video for you now,” and that was it. It was that one-two punch. It was we’ve nailed game design and we’ve nailed the pitch, we know exactly who to talk to and how to talk to them. And they saw those two elements and they’re full line purchase, every single store is getting this game. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild, yeah. Elan Lee: That has never happened on an initial pitch for us ever. Normally, we get into a subset of stores and then, eventually, it rolls out to all the stores. This was the first time ever they said, “Whatever it takes, we need this game everywhere.” Tim Ferriss: Which is still very surreal for me and I’m so grateful, obviously, and it’s terrifying at the same time. Not going to lie, this is mister dip the toe, then one foot, then wade up to the ankles, this is just — Elan Lee: Yeah, fire hose on. Tim Ferriss: — full Monty from second zero. What are other keys to pitching in a line review? And that could also be, I’ll just offer another option, which is what are some common mistakes that people make or that you suspect people make? Elan Lee: Okay. So, the first most common mistake — Tim Ferriss: Because this could be for games but it could be for — Elan Lee: It’s for anything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — cosmetics, it could be for anything. Elan Lee: For anything. The first question is how are you represented in that room? Remember I said they only take a certain number of meetings, it took us five years to get one of those meetings. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: And the way that you get the — Tim Ferriss: Even with the thunderous, crazy lightning-in-a-bottle success of Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: They only have so many hours. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Yeah. So what you have to do instead is you find someone who already has a meeting and you hire them as your publisher and then they represent your game in their meeting. That’s how most companies do it and that’s how we did it for years. So the first problem is you have to make sure that whoever’s representing you, assuming you can’t be in the room because 99.9 percent of the people can’t, they are representing you the right way. With enough attention, they’re pitching it the right way, they’re representing it the right way, they’re saying the right words, they’re conveying the right fun. Tim Ferriss: How do you ensure that? Elan Lee: It’s a personal relationship and you — It’s just hard, it’s really hard. And to be honest, I don’t want to name names, but we went through three different publishers and I wasn’t happy with how — Tim Ferriss: How did you, this may or may not be something you can talk about, but how did you craft the deal structure such that you could take a swing and then you’re like, “Okay, swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else. And then swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How are those deals structured? Elan Lee: We got very lucky. Because our Kickstarter campaign was so through the roof, that fed into our Amazon sales immediately. And so I could go from publisher to publisher saying, “Look how many games I sold the last week, look how many I sold the week before that. This is a prestigious title that you want to represent.” And then when they wouldn’t represent me properly, wouldn’t get the right sales, couldn’t get the right deal structure in place because we also demand quite a bit as far as where the game is placed, is it in aisle, is it out of aisle, meaning is it in the game section or somewhere else. Tim Ferriss: Ankle height versus eye height. Elan Lee: Exactly, right. Those bottom shelves are like a death sentence, nobody looks down there. Can we get games at checkout where they’re selling chewing gum, can we put games there? Can we get games in the catalog? All this stuff that I wanted for our games was just not being properly represented for us. So, eventually, after our sales got high enough, I finally was able to stop doing that silly dance with these publishers and we were able to publish our own games. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. So, if I’m hearing you correctly, the success of the direct to consumer, the DTC, Kickstarter, Amazon, I should say online, those successes allowed you to dictate certain deal terms with the publishers so you had flexibility. Elan Lee: Correct. And they allow us to say you want to represent us. Because, even then, they only have a one, maybe two-hour meeting and so there’s only so many games they can pitch so how do they fill that library. Tim Ferriss: And then you get to the point where you can go and book those meetings yourself. How important was having a critical mass of SKUs? Elan Lee: Oh, it’s everything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because I have to imagine, if I’m a major retailer, I don’t want to have a meeting with someone who only has one thing to sell. Elan Lee: Well, that’s why we couldn’t do it at first. It was only once we had, I think, 10 games was the magic number to make it worth their while. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Yeah. And that takes a long time. And it’s not just 10 games, it’s 10 bestsellers. And unless you’re there, they’re just like, “Yeah, just go through a publisher. We don’t have time for — “ Tim Ferriss: Don’t have time. Elan Lee: We take 10 meetings, we don’t have time for an 11th. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. All right, so what have you learned understanding but, to the extent possible, if we can put aside the element of Exploding Kittens having and developing this incredible track record which allows you to not cut corners in a bad way but you can go in without a finished prototype of the box, et cetera. If we put that aside for the moment, what have you learned about line reviews if you look at your first outing versus — Elan Lee: Yeah. Oh, I love this. Tim Ferriss: — the more refined line reviews? Elan Lee: Yeah, okay. Tim Ferriss: And I’m spending a lot of time on this, guys, because this applies to everything. It applies to so much. You have a movie? Okay, fine, how are people going to see the movie? Yeah, you can go direct but you might want a distribution partner. What we’re talking about will apply to that pitch meeting, a lot of it. And it’s the stuff that mainstream magic is made of is figuring out how to craft these meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Remember you said, “Like it or not, you’re in sales?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Here it is. This is where the rubber meets the road. Dust off your tap dancing shoes because, holy crap, these are tough. So you have to walk into that meeting and first you have to keep in mind you are their 10th meeting. Even if you’re not their 10th meeting, you’re their 10th meeting. They’re in this “I’m tired, I want to get out of this room, I’ve been at this for too long,” they’re in that mindset. So the first thing you’ve got to do is get them out of that funk. You need them to understand that this is going to be the best of the 10 meetings. And you do that with enthusiasm, you do that with props, you do that with a cool video. The stuff that can get them out of, “Oh, this isn’t like the other meetings.” Cool, that’s where you start. So we walk into the room with two of those suitcases, not the ones that fit in the overhead, the big crazy ones you have to check and they’re filled with games, the most beautiful games we’ve got. Even stuff that we’re not pitching that day, even stuff we know will never see the light of day because we’re going to set all of those up. And the basic premise is buy into this world. Exploding Kittens is not a product, it’s a whole world and you can have this world on your store shelves. And so that’s how we start and that’s a really nice way to start. Okay. Then what they’re expecting is, “Okay, pitch us a game one at a time. Pitch this, okay, you’re done. Okay, pitch the next one. Okay, you’re done. Pitch the next one.” What we do is very different. Instead of pitching a game and then pitching the next one, just like I said, for Coyote, we’re like, “Hey, we’re going to play a game.” And usually they say, “We don’t have time to play, can you just pitch it?” And I say, “No, we’re going to play a game.” Confrontation, I get it, but I force them to play the games, every single one of them. Now, I’m not going to play all the way through, I’m not going to spend 10 or 20 minutes. Tim Ferriss: All right. This might seem like a trivial detail but I don’t think it is. You in a tuxedo and a top hat for this? Are you dressed in your Sunday’s finest? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Oh, it’s so funny. So I learned this in my Microsoft days. If I dress up, if I wear a tuxedo, if I wear a suit, if I even wear a button-up shirt, nobody takes me seriously because I’m supposed to be the creative guy. I have to wear the creative guy uniform, I have to wear a t-shirt, I have to wear jeans, otherwise, no one looks at me. So that’s how I show up. Luckily, it’s a really comfortable uniform for me. So I force them to play and I’m there being the game’s biggest cheerleader. I don’t usually let them win, but I usually orchestrate a scenario in the game where they’re having as much fun as possible. And my goal is for them to have exactly those emotions that we talked about. When we start, I need them to think I can do that. And then, a minute in, I need them to think, “Oh, I did that. What’s next? Oh, I can do that next thing too.” And I am just crafting that. And right at the point where they’re like, “Oh, I know what the next thing is,” I pull the game away. We’re done playing, now let me tell you how we’re going to sell this game. And it’s because, at that point, they’re drooling. And I do that 10 times in a meeting and we just keep hitting that over and over. And I am very aware that the last two games I pitch are usually not going to be purchased because they’re exhausted because that roller coaster — they’ve been up and down too many times. Tim Ferriss: Right. So, you’re going to have to figure out the sequence. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Do you start with the game you hope is going to be the big purchase? How do you sequence it? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. We open with our shortest, easiest pitch and what that usually is an Exploding Kittens expansion. So, if I need to sell an expansion box or a new Exploding Kittens product and I know I don’t have to work very hard to sell it because they always sell, that’ll take the first spot. That just warms the waters, gets us all eased in. Tim Ferriss: A little yes momentum. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t hurt. Elan Lee: Yeah. The number two spot is the glory spot. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Whoever is there, that’s the game I’m actually pitching today. That’s where Coyote was, that’s the big thing we’re going to talk about. And then the next five are equal, it doesn’t matter what order they are, those are — usually we’ll sell all five of those. At a typical meeting, all five. What happens after that is very iffy. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Now you mentioned you play the game, you get them super excited, hopefully, they’re drooling over it and then you say, “All right, I’m going to take the game away, here’s how we’re going to sell it.” What is included in the “Here’s how we’re going to sell it?” Elan Lee: Oh, yeah, okay. So important. So this has changed over the last three years. It used to be I have to start with the box and we still — I shouldn’t say it used to be, it still is, we start with the box. “Look how beautiful this thing is,” and we do a mock-up, here’s how it looks on the shelf and it’s usually from a photograph we took that morning. We want to show you, “Hey, Target, here’s what your shelf looks like. Hey, Walmart, here’s what your shelf looks like. Here is our game right there in line.” Tim Ferriss: And I should mention, this probably goes without saying, but you are not just showing up and winging it, you guys — Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: — rehearse like you are going to be performing once in a lifetime at Carnegie Hall. Elan Lee: It is, if we screw up this meeting, our company is screwed. We don’t survive a bad meeting so, yeah, there is nothing that matters more than this. This is, arguably, 70 percent of our business this year. If we mess up this meeting, we will see a 70 percent drop. If they bought zero games, I don’t know that our company would survive that, so it’s a big deal. We rehearse constantly, we make changes constantly, we make all these props. We try to get the spot either right after breakfast or right after lunch because that’s when they’re in the best moods. All of it is orchestrated and so carefully. Who’s in the meeting? How many chairs are we going to fill? Tim Ferriss: How do you request those time slots? Because I imagine you’re not the only people who are thinking about this, right? It makes me think of the data, it’s a meta-analysis long ago looking at judges’ verdicts before or after meals and leniency, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, right. So, how do you get the right slots, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, how do you angle for those? Elan Lee: There’s an art to that as well. So we have agents, we have representatives, one for Target and one for Walmart, and these are people who live in those cities, and they live and breathe sales with the sales rep. So, their job is — the very cynical way to say it is they’re like lobbyists but the more — Tim Ferriss: Ambassadors. Elan Lee: Ambassadors, there we go. That’s a much more appropriate way. They have been doing the job for longer than the salespeople have, longer than the buyers have. And as a result, the relationship that they have with the buyers is actually one of education because they’ve seen all the mistakes, they know where all the landmines are, they know how to avoid them. And so part of the art of getting the best meetings, of getting yourself set up the best, is to hire the best agent. Tim Ferriss: How does someone find said agents? Elan Lee: Friends of friends of friends. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: The best ones already have too many clients. You can’t work with them. Tim Ferriss: Right, the usual situation. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. But if you have a good enough brand, if you have the right relationships, if you can talk to the right people and if you’re persistent, you can get the right agents. I actually thought we didn’t need an agent at all at first. I was like, “We can just do it, we’re going to show up the day before, we’re going to walk into these meetings,” and some very good friends of mine in the industry said, “You are an idiot, it’s just not going to work.” So we started working with agents and they’re incredible. They know the industry, they can — Tim Ferriss: Now, just to dig into that a little, why wouldn’t that work? Is it that the code of etiquette and the way everything has been set up involves those agents and, therefore, it wouldn’t work or are there other reasons why going in guns blazing without representation wouldn’t work? Elan Lee: Yeah, both. The answer is both. So the buyers are much less likely to take you seriously unless you have an agent in the room. And part of that is just because — Tim Ferriss: I guess part of it is just these fools don’t know how this is done. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Right. They’re showing up to Downton Abbey wearing a tank top. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And they don’t know how to use the silverware. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Why should I trust their ability to be a good partner and actually get things done on time if they haven’t done their homework? Elan Lee: Precisely. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: And the other half is you haven’t done your homework. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You actually don’t know, you actually don’t know how to use the silverware. When we walk into a meeting, the agent has done a year’s worth of work prepping for that meeting. They have made sure the buyers know what you’re going to pitch, how many games you’re going to pitch, what the order of the games is. They’ve made sure that the sales for the previous purchases they’ve made going into the meeting so they already have the confidence in, yes, these people are going to deliver. They’ve made sure that inventory levels are where they need to be so that a meeting doesn’t get sidetracked by them saying “This game is sold out, how did you let that happen?” So many things can go wrong that the agent is fixing before they go wrong so that the meeting stays on the rails and gets you to success. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: It’s a full-time job and, without it — Tim Ferriss: And so that agent is the person who lobbies for the appointment after breakfast for lunch? Elan Lee: Exactly, yes. But you have to know to ask for it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, right. Elan Lee: Because your agent has other clients. They’re going to sit through maybe three, sometimes four meetings in that sell cycle and they’re going to give that prime slot to the one who asks for it. So you’ve got to know to ask for it. Here I am telling you on this podcast, it’s probably going to make my job a little bit harder for the next sales round, but so be it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. People listening need to hop through a few hoops before — Elan Lee: Yeah, fair enough, all right. Tim Ferriss: — they end up being viable competition. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. There’s a few other tricks that — Tim Ferriss: And we are going to come back to, if you’re just developing a game at your kitchen table, what are some of the first steps. So, we’re going to get to that. Elan Lee: Yeah, we’ll get there. Yeah, for sure. Tim Ferriss: But in the meantime, you said a couple of tricks of the trade? Elan Lee: Yeah, there’s a few more. I should be a little careful about what I say but, look — Tim Ferriss: We can always bleep things in edit later. Elan Lee: All right. So, you want to pay attention to, believe it or not, all of the retailers have color themes year by year. So you want to make sure that, when you walk into a meeting, your boxes match that color scheme, it makes it much easier for them to say yes. Tim Ferriss: Had no idea. Elan Lee: Yeah, right, I know. Because why would you? Because why would anybody, right? There’s things like those agents are given permission to read the notes from the all-hands meeting from the company so they know what the company’s priorities are. And so you want to sit down with your agent in advance and say, “Those buyers, what are they going to get promotions and raises based on this year? Is it more throughput at the store? Is it promote online sales? Is it match the color scheme?” Whatever it is, you want to make sure — Tim Ferriss: What are the incentives? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you want to make sure that, when they look at your games, they think, “Oh, I’m really trying to promote online sales this year, whoa, this game would do great on our website. And then the next game, this game would do great on our website as well.” And by the time you get to the end of the meeting they’re like, “Oh, my God, I can get a promotion if I just buy all 10 of these games.” That’s what you want them to walk away with. Tim Ferriss: All right. So, these meetings are huge, we’ve established this. A huge deal. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned a couple of tricks to the trade. And any other tips, tricks, learnings along the way? Elan Lee: So what happens after those meetings is also very important. Okay. So there’s two things we have to talk about. One is pricing structure and the other is marketing. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: So in the meeting you talk a little bit about both. You have to now include marketing. Remember I said three years ago things were different than today? Three years ago, the marketing plan that you show for your game is largely your own website. Maybe you’ve bought some TV commercials, things like billboards, product placement here and there, things like that. Today, none of that matters. All they care about is social media because that’s the only form of marketing for games that works anymore, so. Tim Ferriss: I should say also it particularly works on, and this is my understanding, on platforms like TikTok or now that other platforms have realized to avoid TikTok consuming their market share, they need to push and reward short-form video. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Short-form video. Casual games are perfectly suited to short-form video. Elan Lee: Yeah. And the way that you build the most effective videos for those is you need to inspire, I think, two emotions. One, “I understand what those people are experiencing right now,” And two, “I would like to experience that.” And it took me forever to get to those two sentences. At first it was, “Let’s show gameplay, let’s show setup, let’s show a memorable moment. Let’s show people screaming and yelling because they’re having so much fun.” None of that matters. None of that works. “That looks like fun. I could have that much fun.” That’s it. That’s what you’re trying to show. Tim Ferriss: How does that differ from the first? Elan Lee: Um, it’s very, very focused, you want to — remember we talked about mastery early on? Tim Ferriss: Well, I also asked you guys, because we were talking about this very early on in the process, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Also, because if I’m procrastinating doing something hard, I like to talk about the marketing because it just is a lot easier for me to talk about. But I wanted to see examples of videos that had worked for any of your games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Social posts. And so they were sent over. I was like, “Okay, I think I can deduce why this works.” Often it was one person playing the other person struggling to guess what the other person was doing and one person losing it laughing. Just inconsolably, but in the best possible way, losing it, getting the giggles out of control. Elan Lee: Okay. So I’ll tell you, one of the most effective pieces of media we have ever used was for Poetry for Neanderthals. This has like at this point, I don’t know, tens of millions of views. And all it is — oh, sorry, “Here’s how you play Poetry for Neanderthals. I have to get you, I have a secret word on this card. I have to get you to say that word. And I can only speak using single syllable words. That’s the whole game. If I mess up, someone sitting next to me has a giant inflatable neanderthal club and they get to bonk me on the head.” All right. So there’s our whole game. The best video we’ve ever seen is someone who’s trying to get a person to say the word “garage.” And we know they’re trying to get the person to say the word garage because we put that right on the screen. We show you, “Here’s the secret word, it’s garage.” And they’re just saying, “Car, go here. Car, hole, car hole. This car hole, big car hole.” And everyone’s losing it. And the poor person trying to guess is like, “What the fuck is a car hole? Glove compartment? What are you trying to say?” And then they say, “Vehicle. Multiple syllable word.” And so they get bonked on the head. Okay, here’s why that video is so effective. It’s those two senses. One is, “I see the experience they’re having. I get that.” And the secondary corollary is “I could do better than that.” Tim Ferriss: Is this the video, I think I remember seeing this. This might have been a separate video, but there’s a woman who’s the poet and then there’s the guy next to her, holding the club. Elan Lee: Yeah, so menacing. Tim Ferriss: The ax is going to drop. Yeah. And everyone’s losing it, including the guy at the back. Elan Lee: Because you look at that and you say, “I understand the rules,” immediately. “I understand the experience they’re having. I would like to have that experience.” And that’s what makes for an effective social media video. Tim Ferriss: All right, so how do you pitch that? Elan Lee: Well, we show a lot of examples and we show a track record. We say, “Look, here’s how many views our last round of videos got. Here’s how many likes, here’s how many shares, here’s how many subscriptions.” All this stuff, we show them right there in the meeting. We never had to do that. This is a brand new phenomenon. And we say, “Here’s the type of video that we’re going to craft for this new game,” and we always couch it in those two sentences. “Here’s how we’re going to explain the fun people are having and here’s how we’re going to make the audience feel like they would like to have that much fun as well.” And that’s been very effective for us. So that’s now half the meeting, because every game we start by, I demo the game. Tim Ferriss: It’s social media strategy. Elan Lee: Yes. I demo the game, I pull the game back, we talk a little bit about the pricing structure and the theme and the box and all that. And then we go right into social media strategy for that game. Because I have to spend as much time on that as I did on the game design because they’re equally important now. It’s huge. Such a difference. Tim Ferriss: All right, so for somebody listening who is thinking about making a game, and I really encourage everyone to do that, and I’m just going to flash, this is as good a time as any, just to flash these blank cards that are within every Coyote box and they are color-coded. You can use these to make action cards, which are these different gestures and actions and so on. Elan Lee: Yeah. Those are the templates that we use. Tim Ferriss: These are the templates. You can use them to make Coyote cards, these modifiers. You can use them to make the attack cards which you use to sabotage other people. There are other ways to play those cards. This is intended to invite everyone to basically create their own game by modifying the rules. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Or adding new elements that are uniquely their own. You can have fun with your friends, you can have fun with your kids. I mean, this is intended to make you a part of the creative process, which you will be part of anyway, just by the way you play the game but this takes it to another level. And this was a really important element for me. So this will be a warm-up in a sense. You get to try game design, game development light, with these blank cards. But let’s say somebody then decides they want to give it a go, maybe it’s with one of their kids, like you did with your daughter. Maybe it’s by themselves. Who knows? Maybe it’s going to the game shop, local game shop, which I really recommend people do. If you’ve never been to a real proper game shop, go in on a game night when people are set up and also check out the games you might not be inclined to check out. So if you’re a casual gamer, go to a Warhammer night, see what that’s about. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Check out these different worlds. Elan Lee: Another secret weapon is go to a game shop, find the owner, or even the person behind the counter, someone who knows what they’re talking about. And just say, “I’m looking for a game. What game do you wish more people would give a try?” And you’ll find the gems that way because they know. But maybe the game doesn’t have the best box or the best name or it fell short somewhere and people just aren’t buying it, but they know it’s amazing. That’s where you find them. It’s a great experience. Tim Ferriss: So start testing the waters in that way. It’s so easy to do in a place like Austin. I mean, this is Austin. People might think of game locations and X, Y, Z, they’re all over the place. There happens to be a really vibrant scene here. And if you wanted to, if one wanted to start developing their own game, let’s say they find something that starts to stick. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ve got a tiger by the tail. This seems to be working. They’re play testing. It might take a while, like Settlers of Catan, I think Klaus Teuber had 150 versions before, that’s a complex game. But let’s say they start to develop the game and they’re like, “All right, I would like to try to sell this.” What are the options? What would you say to someone who’s like, they’re smart, they can plan, they’ve operated in the world before, so they’re not new to adulting, but they have no experience in selling games. Elan Lee: There are three paths. I’ll tell you all three paths and then I’ll tell you my favorite one. Tim Ferriss: All right. Elan Lee: Okay. Path number one, self-publishing. Self-publishing is hard, but you can print out your own decks. You can design everything yourself. You can write the rules yourself. You can do absolutely everything yourself. And then you can spend a few thousand dollars, publish a few hundred copies, and send them out to all your friends. Okay. So that’s option one. It sucks. Don’t do that one. It’s just the worst. I mean, you’re just going to make every mistake and you’re not — Tim Ferriss: And you’re going to have to pay for your mistakes. Elan Lee: And you pay for every mistake, and then once you make the mistake, now you can’t take it back and you can’t undo it. Just don’t self-publish. It’s a terrible idea. Okay, there’s number one. That’s not my favorite one. Number two is you go to an existing publisher, Hasbro, Mattel, nowadays Exploding Kittens. You can approach big publishers, pitch your game, and then strike a deal with them where they will handle all the risk, but they will also take most of the reward. You can still honestly get very rich this way, but you have to get into their portfolio, so either you need a track record or you just have to absolutely wow them or you need some other — you have to show up with some bona fides. You can’t just say, “I’m a brand new designer, here’s my brand new game, please publish me.” Tim Ferriss: How would you, maybe there are exceptions where people have wowed them, first time game designer with a game, how does one do that? Elan Lee: You go to a convention. Tim Ferriss: You go to a convention? Elan Lee: Yeah, you go to a convention, you demo your game, they will all show up. They’re like agents recruiting for a sports team. They’re going to show up to all of those places and they’re going to walk the halls and they’re going to check even the smallest booths. And they’re going to even go to the big convention halls where everyone just has their own little folding table or even a temporary folding table. They’re going to look at all of that stuff. So it is possible to do it that way, but you have to keep in mind they have very few slots open and they usually only have one or two agents, scouts looking for games. So your chances of success there are low as a first-time person, much better if you can walk in, if you can schedule a meeting and they will take that meeting and then you can say, “Here’s why you should not say no to this.” Tim Ferriss: What are the things you can do or put in a pitch that increase the likelihood of getting a meeting, outside of being an influencer with 20 million followers on Instagram? Elan Lee: Well, yeah, that helps, but the reason that helps is, what I was going to say is the ability to sell the game, whatever it is, maybe you’re an influencer — Tim Ferriss: By the way, also true of nonfiction writing. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: If you’re selling a book. Elan Lee: And for selling a screenplay and for really selling anything, you need to be able to say, “Here’s why people are going to take notice of this thing and why you would be a fool to pass on this opportunity.” That’s hard. Oftentimes the best way to do that is to have already done it, which means your first time out, you need what I’m about to talk about, which is option three. Option three, crowdfunding. This is relatively new, like 10, 15 years old. Tim Ferriss: So it is, I guess, self-publishing in a sense, but you’re getting other people to fund the development. Elan Lee: Two things, yes to that. Exactly right. Other people are funding a hundred percent of the development, which is incredible. But also you are collecting those funds on a platform that promotes the game. People are there watching your video, you’re trying to convince them. Tim Ferriss: It is a discovery platform. Elan Lee: Exactly. Perfectly phrased. It is a discovery platform that was missing 15 years ago. “Watch my self-published YouTube video and hopefully fund my game,” it just didn’t exist. So now people are looking at crowdfunding sites looking for cool new experiences and backing them. And that’s a new invention and that’s really cool. And it’s not my favorite one either. So I just said I picked my favorite and I just pitched three and I said, “None of them are my favorite.” Here’s my actual favorite. A combination of two and three. Start on crowdfunding, especially if it’s your first time out. Learn everything you can. Your first project is probably going to fail. That’s okay. You’ve got nothing at stake. You didn’t lose anything. Fix it. Relaunch it, fix it again. Relaunch it again. Take as many times as you need. There’s nothing at risk here. You’re just learning the process. Awesome. When you get a success on whatever crowdfunding platform you love, now go to those publishers and say, “Here are my bona fides. Here’s proof that this thing is going to sell. I’ve already sold this once. I’ve already gotten 10.” Tim Ferriss: Do you do that before you have shipped the game? Elan Lee: No. Very important. No. Ship the game first. If the only thing you can prove is that you are a train wreck waiting to happen, you will get nothing from them. So ship the game, show that you’re organized, even if it’s a small fulfillment like you sell a hundred copies of your game, show that you can fulfill those hundred copies and then start to show the reactions to those. If you’ve only got a hundred people who bought the game, reach out to every single one of them and beg them to record a video about how much they love your game. And now go to publishers with that. That’s really what you’re searching for. Use crowdfunding as exactly what it is, as a way to launch your new game to then take to step two. Tim Ferriss: Let me ask this. There may be people listening or watching who think to themselves, “That sounds awesome, but wasn’t the heyday of crowdfunding three, four, or five years ago?” Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: You hear less about it. Certainly for, let’s say, selling to a hundred people or maybe many, many more, I’m sure there are runaway success campaigns even today, but are there any tweaks that you would add to it? Elan Lee: It’s really tricky. Okay, so here’s what happened with crowdfunding. So we launched on Kickstarter, Exploding Kittens launched on Kickstarter, and by some amazing twist of fate, that was perfect timing. Very few people had heard of Kickstarter. They heard about this funny, silly thing. It was drawn by The Oatmeal. Matt already had this incredibly large audience and people showed up and they said, “Ooh, crowdfunding. Ooh, this thing costs 20 bucks. I’m going to back this thing.” And we had 219,000 people try that thing. Amazing. Unheard of success. Those people then over the next, let’s call it five years, stayed on Kickstarter and they backed other things, other games, other projects, whatever. And what they found was the nature of Kickstarter is such that only about 50 percent of those projects that shipped either the thing that shipped was nowhere close to the thing promised, or the thing never shipped, and they never got their money back. Whatever it is. Tim Ferriss: People got burned. Elan Lee: They got burned, and they had a terrible experience. And now when you say, “Hey, back my Kickstarter,” everyone’s got this memory implanted of, “Oh, that was a bad experience for me. Maybe I even had some great experiences, but I also had those bad ones and this is not worth it. And I’m not going back to that site or any crowdfunding site.” So that’s the problem. We’re not seeing the numbers we used to see because everyone’s walking in with this baggage and it sucks. My only advice is there is now a secondary ecosystem around Kickstarter, other websites that have gotten very good at promoting projects, that have gotten very good at advertising new offerings on Kickstarter and building trust, like if you get on this other — Tim Ferriss: So it’s like a curated site that vets projects. Elan Lee: Exactly right. And here’s the thing, those companies almost always take a percentage of what the maker gets in exchange for helping them with fulfillment, with creation, with everything. So not only are you buying into a trusted ecosystem, but you also know there’s multiple parties involved that are going to work very hard to make sure you get that product. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those companies? Elan Lee: I would have to look them up. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Yeah, no problem. All right, we’ll put maybe links to a few of them in the show notes. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s a ton of them. They all have the word backer in them somewhere, backer found and backer this and backer that. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ll put a couple of links in the show notes. Tim.blog/podcast, you can find it. And I will also just give a shout-out to a friend of mine who at some point you have to meet, maybe you’ve met him already. Craig Mod, does that name ring at all? Elan Lee: No. I don’t know Craig. Tim Ferriss: All right, so Craig is a gem of a human, amazing writer, also very technical as a software engineer, software development expert. And he, at one point, for his beautiful books that he has bound and crafted in Japan, these are works of art, they’re absolutely beautiful. And he created basically a, I don’t know if open source is the right term, but he does have the code available on GitHub for anybody who wants it, called, I think it’s called Craigstarter, which is effectively, if you want to host your own crowdfunding campaign and in his opinion, fix some of the bugs that were difficult to contend with. Elan Lee: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: Then boom, you can do that. Elan Lee: Oh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: And I think he incorporated Shopify and other add-ons, different services could be as modules. I’m sure I’m not using the right terminology, but incorporated into it. Elan Lee: Super clever. I love it. Tim Ferriss: So people can also check that out. And I have two interviews with Craig. You should check out both of them. They’re absolutely fantastic. Elan Lee: Lovely. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so folks can look at these services as basically a stamp of credibility. They will help not only with the promotion if you are so vetted, but with the fulfillment, like that third-party logistics. Elan Lee: That’s right. Now, I don’t think we’re going to see a crowdfunding campaign on the scale of Exploding Kittens these days. There are a few exceptions. You just interviewed one of them, in fact. Tim Ferriss: Brandon Sanderson? Elan Lee: Exactly, out of control success. Tim Ferriss: $45 million, or whatever it was, Kickstarter campaign for fantasy books. Unheard of. Elan Lee: Bonkers. Unheard of. But what I love is that that shows this is not even a remotely dead platform. Tim Ferriss: No. Elan Lee: There is success to be had here. You just have to be creative. I mean he started out with a great fan base. He picked an incredible title, the first word of his campaign was, “Surprise.” No one’s done that before. What does that mean? And just everything about it. Smart on top of smart on top of smart. I loved it. Loved it. So it’s very possible, but it’s also very rare and you have to be smart about it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, here’s the thing. It’s possible and who cares? It may not have the gravitational pull that it had five years ago, but if you can’t sell anything in a crowdfunding campaign, you are not going to sell any buyer at mass retail. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: It’s not going to happen. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And therefore you save yourself years of banging your head against a brick wall when you’re never going to break through. If you get, and this might not sound like good news, but if it’s going to fail, you want to fail as quickly as possible. Elan Lee: It’s great news, as long as you don’t take it personally, as long as you say “This product — “ Tim Ferriss: How many games do you guys screw around with on any level? And how many make the cut? Elan Lee: We probably work on a hundred games a year and less than 20 make the cut. Tim Ferriss: And that’s with all of your experience? Elan Lee: Yeah. That’s probably way higher than it should be. I’m probably pushing forward games that have no right to be pushed forward. But again, you don’t take it personally. You say, “This game is flawed.” And the faster you can figure that out, the faster you can move on to a game that isn’t flawed. Tim Ferriss: So if I heard you correctly then, it’s crowdfunding. You establish some numbers and so on that you can share that show traction at some type, game reactions, et cetera. Then you take all of that to book a meeting at a trade show or a conference or convention with one of these publishers who already has the annual meetings and line reviews. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And you make a pitch to do a deal with them. Elan Lee: That’s my favorite path through this. Tim Ferriss: What deal terms do you need to pay attention to? Elan Lee: Okay, so there is one very important number that you’re going to get, and it’s going to seem like a very low number, but here’s how this works. Most publishers are going to throw a number at you, like two percent. Tim Ferriss: Royalty rate? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you’re going to think, “Wait a second, I was the inventor, I get 80 percent and you’re offering me two percent?” But here’s what that number actually means. They, the publisher, are going to take on all the risk. They’re going to do all the printing, they’re going to do all the relationship management, they’re going to do that sales meeting, they’re supporting hundreds of people on their staff, they’re doing all this stuff that you are not doing. But in exchange for that, that two percent isn’t two percent of the profit, it’s two percent of the revenue. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Top line. Elan Lee: Exactly. And that is a very important distinction. That makes that two percent probably closer to 20 percent, 30 percent once you do all the math. Tim Ferriss: It’s the opposite of Hollywood accounting. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: It’s not some percentage of net income, which is defined in some Byzantine way to fuck you every which way from Sunday. Elan Lee: Precisely right. Tim Ferriss: If it’s top line — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So just to reiterate what you just said, two percent is more like 20 plus percent? Elan Lee: Yes, that’s exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Of profit? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you can ask them to break down that math for you. You can say, “Show me the spreadsheet, show me what you’re spending, what your responsibilities are, what mine are. After all of those numbers are crunched, what is the total amount you’re going to spend on this game? Show me your total projections on what’s coming in, show me how much I’m going to make of that.” And then you can start comparing those numbers yourself and see, “Oh, of the money that came in, I’m getting 20 percent of it. Even though this number only says two percent.” Once you crunch that math, this is a pretty decent deal. And you can get higher than two percent. Usually not as a first-time developer, but I’ve seen deals anywhere from two to 12 percent on the super high end. Tim Ferriss: 12, wow. Elan Lee: You’ve got to be a rockstar because at 12 percent, now you’re at 50 percent, and that’s tough to get to. You’ve got to really pull your weight to get numbers like that. So those are what the deals look like. And then after that, then the whole relationship moves into this like, “Okay, now what the hell are we actually making? What is the quality of the cards? What are the components in the box? Are you allowed to change rules?” Tim Ferriss: Quick question, is the deal structure similar to a book publishing contract in the sense that the game developer would get an advance against sales? Or is that — Elan Lee: Sometimes. Tim Ferriss: Sometimes? Elan Lee: Yeah. You can negotiate that. I’ve seen publishers do that or not do that. I will just say for Exploding Kittens, we never do advances. Tim Ferriss: It’s fundamentally different also from, say, nonfiction book publishing in the following sense. If you’re taking a, let’s call it conventional publishing approach, which is very similar to selling the game, it’s like you have an agent. You’ve got the editors, let’s just say, and the publishers who are the buyers of sorts, the editor might be the category buyer but they have to get the okay from the publisher for signing off on deals. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And you’ll have your royalty rate, which varies widely, but let’s just say somewhere depending on paperback versus hardcover, up to probably a maximum in conventional deals of 12 to 15 percent of cover, which is also, again, of cover. And then there’s the advance, but the critical difference that I was alluding to is typically when a nonfiction book is sold, you are selling a book proposal, which is a writing sample and a marketing plan. Elan Lee: Wow. Tim Ferriss: And if, and only if, a publisher decides to sign a contract and buy the book, do you get an advance to buy you the time so you can stop doing all of these other things to write the full book, whereas with the game, the game’s got to be ready. Elan Lee: It’s done. Yeah. Now let’s call it 90 percent done, to be fair. And usually when we take on games, we change them significantly just because there’s always a better version, and through testing, we discover it. But the reason we don’t do advances, partially, is exactly what you’re saying. You’re already done. We’re not trying to pull you off of other projects. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You don’t have to stop your nine to five. Elan Lee: Exactly. Exactly. But the other reason is because I want a partnership. I’m not here to say, “You sold us this game. Now we’re never going to talk again.” I want you here every day. I want skin in the game. We’re going to all make this better together, which is why we do so few partnerships. Tim Ferriss: Now, when you do partnerships, meaning you’re the publisher, you’re paying someone a royalty, how do you typically find those? So for instance, and I imagine a lot of it is you guys canvassing and basically asking the question that you recommended people ask the store owners, “Which game do you wish people played more often?” And then you find something that has the bones of a really good game but a piece of it is shitting the bed. There’s something that is broken and you’re like, “Oh, we can fix that broken thing.” Or do you take cold submissions? How does that work? Elan Lee: We have a form. We have a submission form on our website. We almost never find anything there. It’s hard. It’s time-consuming to go through all of them and honestly, it’s just not the highest quality. We also go to conventions. We look a little bit around there. Sometimes we find a diamond in the rough. Tim Ferriss: That’s a crowded fishing hole, right? Elan Lee: Very crowded. The most effective way are those agents. We talk to those two agents and we say, “Hey, people approach you all the time wanting you to be their agent and you have to turn a lot of them down. The ones that you feel terrible about because they’re such a good game and they just can’t get in the door, send them to us.” And that works really well. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Smart. That’s super smart. Aside from a crowdfunding campaign, what would actually cut through in a submission? Are there any ingredients outside of, here are a bunch of compelling data from a crowdfunding campaign? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Or, “Hey, I’ve designed a hundred hit games.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s that. Tim Ferriss: Aside from those two, what other types of lines or elements would cut through the noise? Elan Lee: So remember I said that phrase, the way we design games is we don’t make games that are entertaining, we make games that make the players entertaining. 90 percent of the game pitches I see are attempts to be entertaining games and I just immediately dismiss them. That looks like that game is working so hard to entertain the players. I don’t care. The best games, the ones that I pay very careful attention to, are when everything you do in the game creates an interaction between two players. I’m not interested in a four-player game where all four players are playing solitaire. It’s just, who cares? I’m interested in a game where the players are playing the players and I play a card — Tim Ferriss: We tweaked a lot in Coyote based on that. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So guiding principle. Elan Lee: And those are the best games. Those are the ones I love the most. Those are the ones I want to play over and over again. Tim Ferriss: And it could be as simple as you might, I’m saying you, the listener or viewer might remember holding your cards facing you versus having the cards available to the entire table. Elan Lee: That’s right. Because now we’re playing all together. And the card I choose, if I have a blind hand, if I have a deck of cards and I choose a card and then I play it, that is me presenting a game to the players. If I have all my available cards face up on the table and everyone can see what I choose, and everyone’s hoping I pick that first card, and I hover my hand over it and then I move to the second card instead and everyone starts groaning and then I play that second card anyway, now it’s me playing the players. And those are the best games in the world. Tim Ferriss: What are some common Achilles heels for games that have the potential to be great and huge successes? And I’m not going to mention names, but we’ve talked about a couple of games that you’ve considered buying or publishing, and I’m wondering what are some of the common weaknesses where you’re, this is a great game, but the reason it didn’t work is X or Y or Z. Elan Lee: All right, so there’s two basic places the games fall apart. One is right off the bat, their boxes suck, or the name sucks. The number of games out there called The Legendary Folklore of Gorgonzel. I can’t remember them, I don’t know what they are. I look at this — Tim Ferriss: Got to throw a CØCKPUNCH in there, and then it’s problem solved. Elan Lee: CØCKPUNCH aside, I would argue that those games, they have no chance of success. Yes, they’re going to sell 10 copies to the 10 people that bought The Legendary Tales of Gorgonzel volumes one through six, and they’re going to buy volume seven. Cool, great. I don’t care. Picking the wrong name, picking a non-descriptive name, putting a picture on the box that does not describe gameplay at all and does not provide a compelling narrative about what experience you are about to have, those games have zero chance of success. And I see that over and over and over again. You can fail right up front. And I’ve even seen the biggest publishers in the world mess this up, especially now that game shelves are so crowded and you don’t have five games to choose from, you have 500 games to choose from. And a game that doesn’t do a good job of saying, “Pick me, pick me, pick me,” you’re just not going to pick, so you will fail right there. Tim Ferriss: Or really complicated packaging too. I’ve seen that a bunch. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Where there’s just so much going on. There’s no one dominant element. It’s like, what am I supposed to look at here? Elan Lee: Yeah, what do you look at first? Tim Ferriss: So you can’t. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You don’t look at anything, you look at the next box. Elan Lee: It’s just noise. Just noise. We worked very hard on Coyote, on all our games, but I remember having this discussion about Coyote because this is such an important lesson. When you look at this box, we know the first thing you’re going to look at and we know the second thing you’re going to look at and we know the third thing you’re going to look at, and this is a formula, and we crafted this — Tim Ferriss: It’s a formula. Elan Lee: — very carefully. Tim Ferriss: By the way, also exactly what works in old school print advertising. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Header image, headline, subheading. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Text. Elan Lee: Yeah. And those components are all present here. Tim Ferriss: And if you fuck up the order, pardon my French, the eye doesn’t know how to track or it bounces around. Elan Lee: And if there’s other better options right next door, off you go. We hit those three things on a box meticulously, and your reaction should not be, “I’m going to buy that game.” That’s not our goal. Your reaction is, “I’m going to pick up this game and I’m going to turn it over and I’m going to read the back of the box.” And now we’ve got a very different task. Now we have more real estate we can afford. We still know the first thing you’re going to look at, but now we care a little bit less about the second thing. As long as you’ve already got enough interest, you’ve already committed to picking this thing up, now you’re willing to read a little story. As long as you can see the end of that story and you know it’s not too long, you’re going to read a little story. The goal of this is now purchase. I want you to get to the end of this experience and say, “I’ve got to have it. I want this.” Tim Ferriss: And just for people who can’t see this particular visual, and there’s all sorts of stuff on the back of the card, which we won’t get into, but some people might notice interesting things on the back of the cards. The dominant element on the back of the box is how to play. And man, we worked on this a lot too, with basically three panes, step one, step two, step three. “Put cards on the table, then take turns performing them,” that’s step one. And you’ve got a little visual with the salamander action cards. Then next part is “Play cards to help or sabotage other players,” shows two examples. Elan Lee: “Sabotage” was a very carefully chosen word, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Very carefully chosen. And then the last one is “Mess up and you’re out. The last player standing wins.” That’s for competitive mode. Now, one aspect of this that I think is very clever is not sure if you should buy this game? Give us a few seconds to convince you. And then there’s a QR code. Elan Lee: Nobody does that. This is new. Tim Ferriss: I know. What’s the impetus behind this? Elan Lee: This was an idea I had that we’re demoing on this game, first time ever. My idea was “If I went to the store with you, I could convince you to buy my favorite game because I’m going to pitch the hell out of that game.” But I’m not in the store with you, so that’s a problem. My first idea was for every retail location in the world, “Will they let us install a telephone that you can pick up and talk to somebody?” And they said, “No.” My second idea was, “Can I hire a person to stand in every store and convince you to buy the game I want you to buy?” And they said, “Sort of, but you have to pay for all of that.” And I was like, “Oh, that’s not going to work.” And so this was option three. Tim Ferriss: It’s cool, it’s a lot of people. 6,000 plus people. Elan Lee: I know, right? Can you imagine? This is just a little QR code. And the idea is I can’t stand next to you for every store, but I can tell you what I would’ve said had I been standing there. And so you scan this code and it’s just a 15-second video. In this case, it’s me, Tim, saying, “Listen, you’re holding a game in your hands. It’s the greatest thing you’ll ever see. Let me try to convince you.” And it’s just a pitch. It’s just, if I were standing next to you in the store, here’s why you should buy this game. And I don’t think a lot of people are going to scan that code, to be fair. But for those who do, they’re going to have the experience of a friend telling them, “You should trust me. This is going to be great, trust me.” Tim Ferriss: And it doesn’t take up that much real estate either. It’s an easy addition to the box. Once again, test it. Right. Let’s test it. Elan Lee: Test it. And what’s the worst that can happen? Tim Ferriss: See what happens. And I also want to revisit something you mentioned earlier, which is that royalty rate, whether it’s two percent, it’s up to 12 percent in the book world. Let me take the book world and the publishing world in the book publishing sense is changing a lot, but it’s also quite consistent over time. Different things have changed, sure, audio as a format has grown tremendously and become highly prized now versus 10 years ago when I could carve out those rights, it’s a lot harder to do now if you’re going to do the conventional route. But some folks will look at the percentages and they’ll say, “Well, wait a second, max 15 percent after an escalator, I’m starting off at 12 percent for hardcover. That’s ridiculous. I wrote the whole thing, da, da, da, da, da. I want to make the lion’s share.” There are some instances where you can make that work, but I will say just a few things. When you begin, for most people, unless you are excellent at running a meticulously managed business, it’s actually pretty tough to beat those numbers. In part because you’re going to be sacrificing distribution, so the top of the funnel number is going to be different. Secondly, when you factor in paying various agents, various distributors, and all of these little costs that for you, without any scale of having a thousand skews in a department dedicated to it, you start to very quickly approach that number. Elan Lee: Very quickly. Tim Ferriss: And by the way, you’re running a real business. This is not the easiest thing in the world to do at all. And I will probably do some experiments on that side of the equation in terms of “self-publishing,” which I would put in quotation marks because it’s going to be augmented pseudo self-publishing on a few levels. But I would only have the confidence of doing that myself currently, because I’ve gone through the conventional route multiple times and I’ve also run quite a few businesses. But if you’ve never, what Stephen Key, I mentioned earlier, one simple idea for licensing, what he might call venturing, running a business, do not underestimate the value of your time and sanity also. Elan Lee: It’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Because he’s, “Hey, look, I’ll take the licensing deal, maybe I’ll negotiate the number up a little bit.” But he’s like, “I can do 12 of those a year.” Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s exactly it. Tim Ferriss: And it adds up to a lot. And I have no employees, no supply chain issues. Elan Lee: No risk. Tim Ferriss: No, “Oops, that was printed the wrong way and now I have thousands of books —” Elan Lee: You have to recall those. Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: “— that are sitting in my garage unsold, gathering dust and mold.” Elan Lee: Let me tell you the simplest example of the difference between doing it yourself and getting help, valuing your time. Our very first game Exploding Kittens, I needed to put a barcode on the box because it has to sell in retail. I go, I’m like, I’m going to research this, this can’t be too hard. I do the research and I find this website and it’s, you’ve got to pay some little subscription, 100 bucks a year, whatever it is, and you can generate unlimited barcodes. Amazing. I generate a barcode, I put it on the box. That wasn’t so hard. Then Target’s like, “Well, this is the wrong format.” I’m like, “Okay.” I spend another 100 bucks, I get a different format bar, put it on. They’re like, “We need a different barcode based on the palette that it’s in.” And then I talk to Walmart and they’re like, “Yeah, we use a different barcode format and we need this barcode to represent whether it was picked up in China or Mexico or Poland, so you actually need three different ones. Oh, and by the way, if it’s bundled with other games, we need a fourth one. And by the way, if it ships into Arkansas, we need a fifth.” And I was just like, “Help. Oh, my God, help.” And that’s the difference. You should not get good at this. Why would you want to get good at that? Tim Ferriss: What’s funny is I was actually going to bring up the example of the UPC codes and the ISBN and all this stuff because I also went down that rabbit hole. I’m like, “How hard could it be?” Elan Lee: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: “Oh, this is easy.” And lo and behold, actually it’s a lot of brain damage. I’m not saying that no one should Venture in the sense of self-funding or self-publishing, but it is a lot harder and much more consuming than most people realize. Elan Lee: And there’s no reason, unless you want to do it for a living, there’s no reason to get good at it. There’s no upside there. Tim Ferriss: And do it for a living meaning handle those types of details. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Elan Lee: Anyway, we have a barcode person who does it for a living. She’s quite good. I’m so happy she’s on my team. Tim Ferriss: All right, so on the side of selling games, what else have we not touched on? Any other aspects? Elan Lee: Let’s see. Another thing I learned along the way is there’s two kinds of selling. One is everything we’ve been talking about today. And your expectation is, “I have sold you a game, the game is now your responsibility. And we’ve negotiated a price, you, the retailer, own this game now and you’re going to sell it.” The second kind is the kind that we actually engage in, which is you do own this game, but there are restrictions on how you can sell it. Tim Ferriss: Can you explain that again? When you say you own this game, you mean a retailer? Elan Lee: You, the retailer, have purchased this palette of games from me. Tim Ferriss: I get it. All right. Sorry, I was just clarifying because people might’ve heard that as you own the IP of the game. Elan Lee: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes. Tim Ferriss: You are buying an inventory of this game. Elan Lee: Correct. Now, what if the game doesn’t sell very well? Whose problem is that? Well, if you didn’t think that through and it’s just a straight sale, they can put it in a bargain bin or they can sell it to somebody else who’s then going to sell it. Or if you really didn’t negotiate it, they can force you to buy it back from them. The restrictions on what happens to the game, what they’re allowed to do post-sale is so meticulous and these contracts get so long. And this is another thing, you don’t want to get good at this. You just need to hire someone who has seen every imaginable mistake and knows what to argue for. And oftentimes the retailers don’t care that much about this part, especially because they have a lot of faith. This thing’s going to do well. But when it goes poorly, if it goes poorly, and we’ve had a few examples of this, what do you do next? In the case of something as simple as Amazon, Amazon has a terrible policy for returns. Namely, they will accept all returns and it is the vendor’s responsibility, my responsibility. You buy Exploding Kittens from GameKnight, you play the game, you damage all the cards because you spilled beer all over them, you put them back in the box the next day after you had a great time and you return it and now that’s my cost. And that happens hundreds of times a week. It sucks. There’s also this thing where people will buy counterfeit games and they’ll buy, then, the real version. They’ll buy a counterfeit for a dollar, they’ll buy the real version on Amazon, they’ll keep the real version, they’ll return the counterfeit and now that’s mine as well. And I just spent $20 on that stupid counterfeit version because that’s coming back to me. All of this stuff has to be thought through in advance and it’s tricky, because some retailers, the Targets and the Walmarts in the world, they are so willing to work with you on that stuff. Amazon, not so much. They’re just like, “Oh, you don’t like our policy? All right, well maybe a different platform is for you.” It’s hard. It’s really hard. Tim Ferriss: And I should say that I’ve run into, when I’ve talked about termination clauses or what do we do when everyone’s pissed off and things aren’t working? Because really that’s the only time that you’re going to go back and look at the agreement, which is why Gary Keller, famous for his real estate empire, said, “You should really call them disagreements.” The only time you’re going to look at them is when things are really going sideways. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And there are some people I’ve spoken to about the importance of these things, like, “Wow, that’s really pessimistic.” I’m like, “No, no, no.” Let’s understand the consequences of not going through this. I know so many examples of entrepreneurs who actually had a chance at a runaway success and they did not pay attention to these terms for, say, a QVC or a huge retailer. And this could happen with Kickstarter as well, of course, they get overextended because now they have orders for God knows how much inventory that is well beyond their capacity, their experience, their financial means. And in their mind, let’s take out the Kickstarter or crowdfunding, but they don’t think about the return policy and they get the hug of death. They overextend themselves financially to produce the inventory, they ship it, and then any number of things can happen. It might be net 270 payment terms. Elan Lee: Oh, God. Tim Ferriss: It could be just — Elan Lee: So brutal. Tim Ferriss: — cash flow suicide right on the front end. And on top of that you might get all of it shipped back to you — Elan Lee: All of it. Tim Ferriss: — and it’s your problem. And then that — Elan Lee: It’s so tragic. Tim Ferriss: — is the hug of death and you’re done. Elan Lee: And then you’ve seen this, you’ve seen this picture. You have this friend whose apartment is filled with products and it’s taken over their living space and they have no way to move it. Tim Ferriss: I did that myself early on. I made an audiobook product. I was going to sell millions of this thing. Oh, my God. Didn’t do any market testing, none of that stuff, just high on my own supply. And I had an entire garage full of these things that just melted in the heat ultimately. And at the time though, that was a huge financial risk. I didn’t take so much risk that it torpedoed me, but if I had had that level of self-delusion and lack of experimentation a little later on, it very easily could have been a recipe for disaster. Elan Lee: Totally. Look, there’s so many ways to mess this up. There’s so many ways to mess this up. And the only good news is there is someone out there who has messed it up in every possible way. Tim Ferriss: Or represented people who have messed it up — Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: — in every possible way. Elan Lee: And those are the people you have to work with. You have to. If you don’t, the risk you’re taking on is just massive. Luckily, I had some very good advice early on from people who said, “Don’t take this on yourself. Just don’t do this.” And it’s the best advice I ever got. Tim Ferriss: And I think maybe tell me if this is overreaching on my part, but don’t take this on yourself now in the sense that after you’ve had 10 mega successes and you actually are fluent in retailese and you have the relationships, all right, now you can take some calculated risks. Elan Lee: And now you can hire the people that you would otherwise contract, now you can pull them in-house. Because now you can afford their salaries and now you want them to only be working on your own products. Great. That’s a huge mark of success and really that is exactly the way you reinvest in your own company. Tim Ferriss: And to reiterate just a few things, if you want to develop a game, number one, you can just develop it for your family, your friends, and keep it small. And I will just say in the book world, a lot of later mega successes have started out that way. You don’t have to go for scale, which I think can be a very dangerous word out of the gate. But as you mentioned, you can also, with the blank cards in Coyote, you can get a taste of it, see if you like it, then you can use the books that you recommended. And there are certainly other resources, we’ll put things in the show notes, to play around with prototyping. Look at these initial cards. These are blank cards with Sharpie writing on them. Elan Lee: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Elan Lee: That’s literally it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it, that’s the entire thing. And you can also find kits online, you can find them anywhere you want. Amazon has gaming kits where there are blank dice and cards and so on so you can workshop it. Elan Lee: Easy. It’s so easy. Tim Ferriss: It’s like Build-A-Bear for games basically. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And what I would add to that is you don’t need to run a big business to be a successful game designer. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: In fact, I would imagine most of the legendary game designers are not running companies. Elan Lee: No, definitely not. Tim Ferriss: They’re designing games and licensing them. And man, there are some legends out there. Elan Lee: Legends. They’ve created incredible games and they’ve generated gigantic wealth for themselves because in success, that two percent deal, that five percent deal, whatever it is, that faucet doesn’t turn off, that’s in perpetuity. In summary, I don’t think the games business is going anywhere. Tim Ferriss: And also there is a lot of room to innovate. There still is room. There’s so many games, but I wouldn’t have even attempted to create a game had I not thought there was space. Elan Lee: The thing is, it’s like saying, is there still space in the book industry, in the movie industry? All a game is is an idea delivered in a new way. When are we going to run out of ideas? When are we going to run out of delivery mechanisms? The answer to both of those individually is never. Combine them both together and it’s just build games forever. You’ll always have a new way — Tim Ferriss: Option. Elan Lee: — to deliver it. Tim Ferriss: All right, so I’m trying to think of anything that we missed. I do have a tantalizing offer for listeners and viewers just for fun because why not? And we will have also mentioned that in the intro. But before I get to that, anything critical that we’ve forgotten? Is there anything that we have left out or any other resources, people to watch, maybe people to Google and Wikipedia maybe? Anything at all? Elan Lee: All right. I’ve got two. I’ve got two that are interesting. One is there is a podcast I quite like for game design, it’s called Fun Problems, it’s with Peter and AJ. And all they do is they talk about game design. Now, they do talk about more hardcore games than I am accustomed to. It’s a wide range of topics, but it’s fun stuff and it’s worth listening to if you want to know more about game design. And the second thing is, because of you. Because of you, because of this process, this journey that we’ve been on over the last few years, I realized that I don’t document any of this ever. I never talk about what goes into a game design, I never talk about where to buy blank cards, and I never talk about why anybody can do this and what the process is like. I’ve started recording it and I started for the first time, I can’t believe I’m saying this, I actually started a YouTube channel and you can actually go and watch these instructional videos. Literally if you want to make a game, the whole idea is: here is how to make a game from scratch. Nobody’s watching right now, but — Tim Ferriss: YouTube.com at Elan Lee, that’s E-L-A-N-L-E-E. You can also just search him on YouTube. The first result will be our podcast together. Elan Lee: That’s true. Tim Ferriss: Episode one. And then within the first few results, you’ll also find it. But I’m pretty sure the URL is YouTube.com/@ElanLee. And let’s finish up with a few things. The first will be the tantalizing offer that I mentioned. The tantalizing offer is this, there’s no purchase required whatsoever, so if any sweepstakes sharks are out there, take it easy, take it easy. This is going to be just a fun little, it’s not even a competition, just a fun little experiment that I want to run. *** [Interview pauses] 02:46:00 to 02:48:14 Tim Ferriss: Hi, everyone, Tim here with an update, as details have changed since that first conversation with Elan. Here’s the tantalizing offer that I wanted to share with you. You have two very easy ways to enter for a chance to win a trip to a secret Los Angeles mansion for an unforgettable day or evening with me and Elan and maybe some special guests. Here’s how. Option number one, simply visit any Target or Walmart and take a fun photo or video with a Coyote game. No purchase necessary. Option number two, if you already bought Coyote, record yourself playing the game with friends or family. That’s it. I would love to see it. Then share your photo or video on Instagram or Tik Tok or both and tag me and ExplodingKittens. You can find us easily, but I’m @TimFerris on both. That’s @ Tim F-e-r-r-i-s-s and Exploding Kittens is ExplodingKittens on Tik Tok and @GameOfKittens on Instagram. So share your photo and or video on Instagram and or Tik Tok. Put them everywhere. Why not? And tag both me and Exploding Kittens. Longtime listeners know that I have a love of deadlines. This is how things actually get done. So, the deadline to post is August 17. That means that 10:00 p.m. PDT August 17. By then, you need to have posted and done all this stuff. By August 31st, we’ll randomly select five winners from people who post. Each winner will receive roundtrip airfare within the US, one night at a hotel, and will join us at our secret LA mansion party. And I think the legal elves wanted me to mention that that’s going to be coach airfare. So, just to be super clear, important legal disclaimer. No purchase necessary. Open to US residents aged 18 or older. So no little kids, no minotaurs allowed. Void where prohibited. Winners selected at random. Odds depend on number of eligible entries. Travel dates must align with the event likely in September. We are still finalizing the time with the busiest man in show business, Elan Lee himself. For official rules, eligibility details, and final date, please visit tim.blog/rules. So, go ahead, post a creative Tik Tok or Insta real or a photo with Coyote by August 17th, 10 p.m. PDT. Tag us and you might just be celebrating with us in Hollywood this fall. Now, back to the episode. *** [Interview resumes] Tim Ferriss: What else? Anything else to add? I have a little bit. I have one more thing I want to say. Elan Lee: Oh, okay. I want to hear one more thing. Tim Ferriss: I just wanted to thank you so much for allowing me to be part of this incredible ride — Elan Lee: Oh, my goodness. Tim Ferriss: — and just collaborating on the game. It’s been so meaningful for me and so much fun and so great to get closer with you and your family, and we’ve all been traveling together since. Elan Lee: I love it. Tim Ferriss: And to work with the incredible team that you have at Exploding Kittens. I’m not going to mention them all because there are quite few — Elan Lee: So many. Tim Ferriss: — but it’s just been such a joy and a dream come true to actually have this thing in my mind that was floating around that I’ve always wanted to do. And now here it is and people can get it. Elan Lee: Tim Ferriss made a game. Look, here’s the thing — Tim Ferriss: I’m thinking — Elan Lee: — you’re so welcome and thank you. We have limited time here and you have to choose your endeavors wisely, and this was one of the wisest choices I’ve ever made. Tim Ferriss: Oh, thanks, man. All right. We’re going to go get a fantastic meal. It’s Texas, so probably a bunch of meat, barbecue. Who knows, maybe some tequila and make an appearance unbidden. You never know. Strange things happen out here in Austin, Texas. And for everybody listening, we will link to all sorts of things, many resources that will help you think about how you might create a game. You could start with the blank cards in Coyote. Those will actually teach you a lot, I think, as you begin to experiment with these different elements. Elan Lee: Because you’re going to fail, because your first few are not going to work and you’ll learn why. Tim Ferriss: And then if you run out of blank cards, look, just go get some blank cards. Just go buy a blank deck and you can use those. But this is something anyone can do. You did this with your daughter when she was how old? Elan Lee: Four. Tim Ferriss: Four. This is an incredibly fun family activity. It’s an incredibly fun friend activity and it gets you off of your screens. It’s not good for you folks. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: They are tools, but there is a point at which the tools become our masters and that is where a lot of the poison seeps in around the cracks. Elan Lee: This thing builds memories. That’s what you should be doing. That’s what your phone isn’t doing. This is building memories. Tim Ferriss: Building memories with some durability, not ephemera that get pushed out of your head as soon as you watch the next 10-second clip. This is something I’ve wanted to do for so long and I’m thrilled that it’s here. Fingers crossed. I’m still nervous as hell, obviously. But we’ve done so much play testing. Hundreds of people have play tested at this point and have made these fine-tuning tweaks along the way. I would love everybody to think about your life as a collection of games. You may not be aware of which games you’re playing just yet, but rest assured in some respects you are playing games and you get to choose more games than you realize. Most of them are optional, not all of them. Sure, we have responsibilities as adults and so on, but this is a way to open up that Pandora’s box of possibility. And we’ll include a lot of resources in the show notes, so tim.blog/podcast, just search Coyote. That’ll probably be the easiest way to find it. C-O-Y-O-T-E. And another time I’ll explain the backstory there, which is pretty wild, but for another time. And until next time, as always, be a little kinder than is necessary, not just to others, also to yourself. Play wisely. Find fun problems. And I’m going to check out that podcast. And life is short, have fun while you’re here, folks. And until next time, thanks for tuning in. Δ Δ Comment Rules: Remember what Fonzie was like? Cool. That's how we're gonna be — cool.

Title: Bitcoin Holds Strong Near All-Time High – Market Not Overheated Yet, Data Shows

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin is holding firm above the $115,000 level after several days of trading below it, signaling renewed strength in the market. The bullish tone is building as Ethereum posts massive gains and altcoins begin to show strong moves over the past few days. For some analysts, this could be the start of the long-awaited altseason; for others, it’s simply the rest of the market catching up to Bitcoin’s earlier rally. Top analyst Axel Adler noted that Bitcoin’s price is now trading close to its all-time high, with the BTC Z-Score (Price, 30/365) sitting around +1.5σ above its one-year norm. This reading is well below the +2.5σ level typically associated with overheating, suggesting that while momentum is strong, it is not yet at extreme levels. The current environment offers a favorable backdrop for potential upside, with room for the market to expand further before reaching overheated conditions. With altcoins gaining traction and Ethereum’s rally adding fuel to the market’s optimism, the coming days could determine whether this is a sustainable breakout or just another phase of consolidation before the next major move. According to Adler, Bitcoin’s current market setup is showing a positive backdrop but with some important caveats. Adler points out that the Adjusted Price Divergence (APD) remains negative near −1.5 after rebounding from local lows around −2. This metric suggests that Bitcoin’s price is still outpacing on-chain activity, although the gap between the two is narrowing. In other words, while price momentum is firm, the network’s transactional activity and usage haven’t yet fully caught up. This discrepancy creates an interesting dynamic for the market. Adler explains that the bias still favors price, meaning momentum is being driven more by investor positioning and sentiment than by on-chain fundamentals. For the rally to gain more structural support, a healthier setup would see APD move toward zero. This could happen in one of two ways: either network activity increases significantly while price moves sideways or posts modest gains, or Bitcoin’s price cools off to better align with current usage levels. Importantly, Adler warns against interpreting APD moving toward zero as a direct buy or sell signal. Instead, it represents a sign of normalization — a point where market price and underlying network fundamentals are better aligned. For now, Bitcoin’s technical and macro backdrop remains bullish, but sustained long-term growth will likely require the network to catch up with price action. Bitcoin is consolidating above the $115,724 support level after a brief dip below it earlier this month. The daily chart shows price stabilizing just above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), currently near $113,324, which has acted as a strong dynamic support throughout the recent uptrend. The short-term structure remains bullish, with BTC trading inside a range between $115,724 support and the $122,077 resistance level. Volume has tapered off slightly since the early August rebound, suggesting the market is in a wait-and-see mode before a potential breakout. A decisive close above $118,000 could invite another test of the $122,077 resistance, a key level that has capped upside attempts multiple times. If broken, this could open the door toward new all-time highs. On the downside, losing $115,724 would shift focus to the 100-day SMA at $108,983 as the next major support. Until then, the higher-lows pattern suggests buyers are defending the mid-$115K zone aggressively.

Tim Leunig US stock market outperformance reliesÂ on the âMagnificent 7â: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google, Android), Meta, Nvidia andÂ Tesla. Over the last decade, these stocks typically returned at least 500%. Without them, stock market rises would have been less than 2% aÂ year, afterÂ inflation. Pretty much everyone has an Apple or an Android phone. A new firm would struggle to break into that duopoly. Nokia, Blackberry: they came and went. Apple and Alphabet would have to really mess up to be in trouble. Walmart will do its best to cut Amazon down to size, but economies of scale in online retail and delivery are real.

But Tesla is vulnerable. Not because some people hate Musk for supporting Trump; or because others hate him for attacking Trump. But because lots of good, rival electric cars mean Tesla has no market power. In 2013, Autocar magazine described theÂ Tesla Model S as âa triumphâ, its 300-mile range about three times that of any other electric car available. Add in the supercharger network â then exclusively restricted to Tesla â and Teslas were the only EV that worked like a normal car. That gave the firm market power. Today, by contrast, while a Â£40,000 Tesla Model 3 can travel 320 miles, a 380-mile Kia EV3 costs a couple of thousands less. Teslaâs 430-mile longer-range Model 3 costs Â£45,000, but just Â£600 extra gets you a 480-mile Mercedes-Benz CLA. Tesla has a competitive offer, but it is not unique, and that hits pricing and margins. Outside of the US, Tesla produces only two, relatively similar, cars. It has no rival to this yearâs Car of the Year, the Â£23,000 electric Renault 5. As a contrast, Hyundai offers five EVs, ranging from the tiny Inster to the massive Ioniq 9. Whatever type of EV you want, Hyundai can help. Competitive pressure means Teslaâs net income was lower in 2024 than in any post-pandemic year. Related articles: Elon Muskâs $30bn Tesla stock option proves CEO pay in Silicon Valley is âbonkersâ Patricia Clarke Muskâs chatbot praises Hitler then says âsorry, my bad, I fell for a hoaxâ John Naughton The Chris Riddell cartoon: draining the swamp Chris Riddell Tesla has a second revenue stream: selling carbon credits to other car firms. The US requires car firms to lower their average CO2 emissions, while Europe requires them to sell a minimum proportion of EVs. Companies that fail can buy credits from firms, such as Tesla, that do better. Unfortunately for Tesla, President Trump has abolished this requirement in the US, destroying that revenue stream. In Europe, the EU has weakened the standard a little, reducing the value of credits. In any case, there are no credits to sell if you donât sell cars, and Teslaâs European sales have halved in the past year. Tesla is a bet on Elon Musk. That is why he can successfully demand an additional $30bn with the threat that he will otherwise walk away. That $30bn is a straightforward reduction in returns to shareholders. Shares in a company where the CEO can take so much of the upside, even in bad times, should not trade at high valuations. Capitalism can be cruel and merciless to companies that invent. All too often the second- and third-placed companies overtake the original innovator. Henry Fordâs production line cut the price of the Model T from $825 to $260 between 1908 and 1925, an 80% real-terms fall. Despite his genius, General Motors sold more cars than Ford by 1927. They copied Fordâs production line, and offered buyers a âcar for every purse and purposeâ. The parallels between then and now are uncanny: an autocratic, rather odd, genius inventor (Ford, Musk) achieved something amazing, and yet the dull-as-ditchwater corporate follower (GM, Hyundai) wins out. Perhaps Hyundai bosses have been reading business history books, and realise Tesla is as vulnerable now as Ford was then. The future for Tesla is probably muchÂ like that of Ford after the 1920s â just another erratically profitable car firm, with a share price to match.

Title: TCS layoffs mark end of one IT era, and the start of another

Time Published: 2025-08-10T02:35:08Z
Full Content:
“The future is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed,” goes the famous quote. Well, neither are job losses — or so the 12,000 laid-off employees of TCS might be ruefully thinking as they packed their personal effects, while simultaneously reading about the $100m salaries that Mark Zuckerberg was dangling to lure AI researchers to his company. There has been a spate of layoffs in tech companies, with Microsoft firing 15,000 employees, Intel 5,000, and Meta and Amazon joining the party. Much of the losses were ascribed to AI, which is driving workforce efficiencies and empowering one human to do the job of many. Till now, most of the layoffs were happening in far-off places like the US and Europe, but the TCS announcement that it was letting go 2% of the workforce brought this phenomenon closer home. Companies like TCS have traditionally been seen as a safe harbour, the closest to a ‘govt job’ in terms of stability and tenure. It had remained so through the dotcom bust, the financial crisis and others. But now, with the advent of AI, the myth seems to be busted. While TCS is the most prominent example, it is not alone. Big consulting firms are ‘streamlining’ their workforce, other big IT services firms are making disturbing noises, and job portals are teeming with tech workers’ resumes. TCS has gone to great lengths to not pin the blame on AI. But the subtext of terms like “a skill mismatch” and “future-ready” is hard to ignore. In many ways, this has been a long time coming. The IT services model of cost-arbitrage, deploying vast armies of coders and consultants at lower cost, has been in its twilight era for a while. AI just accelerated the trend, disrupting the existing linear model where more projects meant hiring more people. Now, a human analyst and a few AI agents working together can potentially do what ten analysts once did. In its place, a new kind of IT services firm is emerging — leaner, AI-native, and outcome-focused. These firms will not hire a thousand freshers to handle client reports or debug software, but deploy a small team of AI-literate experts and a suite of autonomous agents to do the job faster, cheaper, and often better. We are seeing early glimpses already, with new services startups using agents like Cursor or Devin, legal firms operating with Harvey, and research teams powered by Perplexity and NotebookLM. The societal impact of this transition in India will be immense. The whole education model of training young people in STEM skills to then place them in some IT company ensuring a stable career with a decent salary is under threat. However, this tectonic shift presents as great an opportunity as the magnitude of the threat. This is especially true for younger, entry-level employees, since “breaking first is the bottom rung of the career ladder” as Aneesh Raman, the chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, wrote. However, with every crisis, including this one, comes great opportunity. These are five things I believe young people should do in this inevitable age of AI: Leapfrog with AI: The definition of literacy now includes the ability to work fluently and naturally with AI tools and agents. If you know how to, you can take AI’s help to do jobs the seniors traditionally did and jump straight to the second or third rung of the job ladder. In a recent post, for example, a tech founder offered a programmer with 2-5 years of experience a Rs 1 crore salary — qualifications and experience were not important, just the use of AI to code. Study humanities with STEM: Prompting is about knowledge, creativity, critical thinking, literature and grammar — core humanities skills. As answers become a commodity with AI, questions or ‘prompts’ will become the differentiator. Don’t just join a company, build one: There has been no better time to create a company with AI tools, agents, and ‘vibe coding’ available to everyone. It is the age of one-person unicorns — one human and a thousand AI agents building billion-dollar startups. Build a career portfolio: Don’t do just one thing. Be a product designer who also writes; a digital marketer who teaches music; a coder who also runs a pet shop. With AI, one company, many employees will give way to one employee with many companies. Build your personal brand: Do not depend on where you work for your identity; leverage AI to build your own through the talents you have or learn. You will never be out of paying work. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella put it: “AI is not here to replace humans. It is here to remove the barriers that prevent humans from doing their best work.” This crisis gives us the opportunity to do precisely that. (Jaspreet Bindra is the founder of AI&Beyond. His latest book is ‘Winning With AI: Your Guide to AI Literacy’) Views expressed above are the author's own.
