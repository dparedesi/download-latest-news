It's the era of the megamanager, driven by cost cutting, leaner bureaucracy, and slow hiring. A new Gallup survey reveals how teams are evolving and the factors that contribute to manager burnout. Managers' average number of reports — their "span of control" — has grown over the past year, rising from 10.9 in 2024 to 12.1 in 2025. It's also a marked increase from pre-pandemic levels; in 2013, managers had an average of 8.2 people reporting to them, and by 2019, this number had increased to around 9. Are you a manager with 25 or more direct reports, or have been asked to take on more reports in the "Great Flattening?" Contact this reporter at jkaplan@businessinsider.com. That's driven primarily by an increase in teams with 25 or more people, which saw a two percentage point rise over the past year. Around 13% of managers have 25 or more direct reports. At the same time, 97% of managers are taking on individual contributor work that falls outside of their leadership purview. "I don't think increasing span of control blindly is going to work very effectively if those conditions aren't taken into account," Jim Harter, Gallup's chief scientist of workplace management and well-being, said of the balance between individual contributor tasks and leadership responsibilities.

In recent years, layoffs at firms like Intel, Amazon, and Meta have trimmed middle managers to rectify what they viewed as excessive layers of bureaucracy. "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a 2024 memo. "If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership." Flattening management layers is a concept that experts previously told Business Insider is sound, provided that remaining managers have support, training, and the right mix of responsibilities. In 2024, Yvonne Lee-Hawkins, a middle manager, told Business Insider that she had gone from managing zero to 21 direct reports and ultimately quit due to burnout. "Our meetings became transactional because we only had time to discuss the most urgent issues," Lee-Hawkins said. "We no longer had time to get to know each other, ask questions, seek advice, or work on career development." What's key in trimming layers, as the Gallup survey illustrates, is how engaged workers already feel, and how these new megamanagers spend their time. For instance, managers who spend less time on individual contributor work — tasks outside their leadership duties — typically have more engaged teams, regardless of the team's size. "When you have employees increasingly detached from their employer, and then you suddenly start increasing span of control without putting the right conditions in place, I think you run a risk because they're already increasingly feeling detached," Harter said. "We found that managers that have at least one weekly meaningful conversation with each employee do substantially better." Tanuj Deora, a Gen X vice president for deployment at clean energy firm Sparkfund, said that the trend around being more "thoughtful" about bureaucratic structure within companies has value. He's held management roles since the late 1990s, advising on structures for teams of up to 50. He said it's essential to consider a manager's level of experience. "If they're relatively new managers, you probably want to give them five or six people. You want to give them a couple of people," Deora said. Gallup's Harter said that there are often two reasons someone becomes a manager: They're a strong individual contributor, or they have a long tenure at their company. However, neither of those factors necessarily relates to how effective they'll be in a managerial role. "What happens is in organizations, people stay a while, and they feel a need to promote people continually. And the avenue for promotion tends to be, we're going to give you a managerial role because it tends to be associated with more money and status," Harter said. "I would say the most effective organizations think about how they create high-status individual contributor roles so that people don't feel like they have to become a manager to be effective."

Title: The 3 main storylines investors need to be watching as earnings season picks up steam

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earnings season kicked off with a bang on Tuesday with a report from headliner JPMorgan. The company's stock ultimately fell 4% due to a mix of two factors unique to the business: (1) a surprise drop in investment banking revenue and (2) uncertainty around President Trump's proposed credit card interest cap, to which JPMorgan is especially exposed as America's largest issuer. It was a good primer for the upcoming earnings season, which could make or break the fortunes of major US companies, especially when it comes to AI plans. The previous quarter already saw a simmering of the red-hot AI trade for companies planning to continue spending heavily on capex without immediate tangible results. Just ask Meta and Microsoft how it went when they pledged to keep pouring billions into AI (spoiler alert: not well). With that in mind, First Trade — with the help of the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs — has put together a three-part earnings primer for those looking to gain an edge up. 1. Watch for signs of AI-adoption progress So far, in the AI trade, it's been the infrastructure stocks that have dominated — the chipmakers and picks-and-shovels companies that make up the physical components of data centers. Goldman says that gains will broaden out to increasingly include companies showing productivity gains unlocked by AI. A prime example of this dynamic in action came last quarter, from freight-logistics company CH Robinson, which raised its profit-growth forecast specifically due to new AI efficiencies. The stock spiked 20% during the next trading day, and it's been at record highs pretty much ever since. The market is being clear about what it wants. Actually achieving that is the hard part. 2. Monitor how companies are planning to spend their cash Concerns over AI overspending reached a fever pitch last quarter — a trend Goldman expects to subside throughout 2026 after one last hurrah. The firm predicts that hyperscaler capex will see above-forecast growth for one more quarter, then begin a gradual deceleration, as shown in this chart: An additional element to watch is the degree to which that AI capex spending comes at the expense of share repurchases. After all, buybacks are crucial for engineering share-price increases during periods devoid of other positive catalysts. Goldman predicts that investors will reward companies generating strong free cash flow, which have the flexibility to return cash to shareholders. The firm says that group of stocks already outperformed throughout 2025. 3. Check the sustainability of earnings growth for mega-cap tech The number to watch here is 20%. That's the target Goldman has set for Magnificent 7 profit expansion in the quarter. Any downside disappointment here could mean stock declines. After all, earnings growth is the lifeblood of any bull market. Jump to

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. American investors are worried. They've been worried for a while now: that a recession is coming, that stock valuations are overheated, and that AI spending is the only thing keeping the economy (and markets) afloat. And if you're in the wealth management business, like Goldman Sachs, it's your job to listen to these concerns. To nod solemnly and empathize as your millionaire clients lay bare their greatest fears. And then it's your job to tell them that, actually, things aren't so bad, and despite all the apparent chaos out there, it would be quite unwise to cash out your chips in the US stock market. Goldman Sachs' wealth management unit did just that Monday, sending out a report to clients saying that the outlook for the US economy and stock market is bright — and that most of the concerns keeping investors awake at night are overblown. "Clients — and also some colleagues — are now asking whether it is time to reduce exposure to US equities in favor of other developed and emerging markets," the firm's Investment Strategy Group wrote in its 2026 outlook report. But it concludes that many of the perceived risks dominating conversations these days — from tariffs to government dysfunction to market concentration — are overstated, and that the most significant risk for equities, a US recession, is unlikely. The group puts the probability of a recession at 25%, down from last year's estimate of around 35%. Instead, Goldman's base-case projection calls for continued economic expansion and robust earnings growth for the S&P 500. "We wanted to emphasize that in spite of all the headlines that you read about 'Is America on the decline?' et cetera, we want to make a very strong stand and say, 'No, that is not the case,'" Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer of the Investment Strategy Group, said in a media appearance for the report's release. The US remains the preeminent destination for investors around the world, Mossavar-Rahmani said — and a "surprising" number of popular narratives miss what's actually driving growth and returns. "We want to dispel a couple of myths," Mossavar-Rahmani said. Here are some of the other takeaways from Goldman's Investment Strategy Group, and what they're telling wealthy clients to do with their money in 2026. Goldman's team argues that "US preeminence" is evident across multiple measures, including economic wealth, labor productivity, deep capital markets, and natural resources — advantages they say are difficult for other major economies to match. They also point to US leadership in key innovation areas, including semiconductors, biotechnology, and AI, as well as the scale and liquidity of US equity and bond markets. Despite political turmoil and tariff uncertainty, Goldman says the US remains a magnet for global capital. "When people say, 'Oh, money's flowing out of the US.' It actually isn't. We had one month when that was the case," Mossavar-Rahmani said. That month of outflows came last April, in the aftermath of Trump's Liberation Day tariff plan announcement. Since then, foreign investors have flooded back into the US. One argument for US economic fragility is that the boom in AI-adjacent tech spending — including data centers, chips, and power infrastructure — is propping up GDP. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has a more dour global economic outlook, estimated the US would have been in a recession in the first half of last year if not for AI investments. A report from Deutsche Bank shows they're not alone in that sentiment. But Goldman says that view is off base, and that people underestimate how much consumption contributes to GDP. The bank's investment strategy group estimates all tech-related spending accounted for 0.5% of the 2.1% GDP growth in 2025, and Goldman's chief economist says AI capital expenditures accounted for just 0.1%. The estimate, which "includes everything related to AI, including data centers," Mossavar-Rahmani said, is "probably a little bit on the high side because they're trying to include all the power generation as well, all the utility infrastructure that has benefits elsewhere other than just AI." This dovetails with the myth that the US stock market is dependent on AI and the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), according to Mossavar-Rahmani. "It's just not correct that AI has driven everything in the US, including all earnings and including S&P 500 returns," Mossavar-Rahmani said. While no one disputes the incredible performance of these tech titans, Goldman contends that the rest of the S&P 500 receives short shrift and that earnings growth and returns remain respectable even after stripping out the contributions from the Magnificent Seven. "This idea that it would be a poor economy, a weak economy, no earnings, no returns is again, just another falsehood," Mossavar-Rahmani said. The S&P 500 hit record highs last year, and investors often worry that new highs mean a painful drop is imminent. In reality, history shows that the market usually continues to post robust gains after hitting an all-time high, Goldman notes. While Goldman acknowledges valuations are elevated, it doesn't see an overheated market reminiscent of past market bubbles. It expects the S&P 500 to continue its rise in 2026, with a base-case estimate of a 7% total return and 10% earnings growth. Goldman's "good" scenario assumes a 17% return; its "bad" scenario assumes a 15% decline in a recession. (The team assigns a higher probability to upside than downside.) "We do think that there are some good fundamental reasons why valuations have increased over time that are not just because of speculative excesses," said Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation within Goldman's investment strategy group. In the run-up to the Dot Com bust at the turn of the century, for example, valuations and investor exuberance were divorced from earnings reality, which isn't the case today. Yes, the S&P 500 is highly concentrated, Goldman says, but today's tech companies have enormous profit margins justifying their stock valuations, not just hype. Goldman isn't worried about a bubble in US equities. Where its investment strategists do see cause for concern is bitcoin. "We do think bitcoin is a bubble," Mossavar-Rahmani said, noting that explosive price behavior in the cryptocurrency usually precedes a steep drawdown. "We are even more convinced than we were in 2021 that bitcoin has no real value, that it is a speculative and trading asset and that only questionable practices support its current price," the 2026 outlook report says. Another area of concern is gold, which is at unsustainable price levels unless central banks — especially the Chinese government and households — continue to buy it to prop it up, Mossavar-Rahmani said. "We do not recommend clients use gold or bitcoin as a hedge in their portfolios," the report says. There are also "pockets of euphoria" in generative AI, with some public and private companies carrying bubble-like valuations, according to Goldman's outlook, which calls out the circular financing, easy credit, and questionable economics, coupled with soaring expectations. "Some AI company founders and CEOs of the major companies involved with AI have raised expectations to an unrealistic level about what AI will deliver in the near future in terms of both revenues for the AI companies and productivity gains for enterprises leveraging AI," the report says.

Title: California's Billionaires Rage at Huge Tax Bill to Fund Illegal Migrants' Health Subsidies

California’s stock market billionaires are angrily denouncing a proposed tax to fund healthcare for the millions of illegal migrants they welcomed into their state. The tech sector “is getting what they had coming ….[after] pushing for open borders and unbridled employment visas,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, which opposes the H-1B program. He continued: A strong, middle class that can form families, pay for college educations without going into debt, and pay for health care, doesn’t need this kind of a [tax] grift … but now it’s on the tech bros to pay for the health care for all these illegal immigrants — and all the healthcare workers who have to service them. “You funded Democrats and the people who censored, locked down, and tormented us. That was your political gamble,” said a message from conservative activist Mike Cernovich. In a later tweet, he added: 90% of Tech and VC [executives] are cultural Marxists with a hatred of Americans. That’s why they want infinite [subordinate] H-1B’s. They hate [citizens]. But, he added, “There’s a split happening … We can take back the country with 10% of them.” Billionaire Rethink The political drama is forcing many billionaires to recognize that their pro-migration policies are importing resentment and poverty, so shifting national politics against their pocketbooks. The proposed tax is likely to appear on California’s ballot in November. Once passed, the measure would require roughly 200 billionaires to pay a share of the controlling value they own in companies, including companies they founded. Proponents say the ballot would raise $100 billion, mostly for healthcare programs. On January 10, the Wall Street Journal quoted an official at the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, saying, “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives…the few [billionaires] who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a supposed moderate Democrat, has supported the proposed tax. He needs the support of Democratic-aligned unions for his expected presidential campaign. Many billionaires are blasting the tax as a crude wealth-grab — and some are leaving the state. “I love California … but stupid wealth tax proposals like this make it irresponsible for me not to plan leaving the state,” said DoorDash founder Andy Fang, who gained billions by creating an industry of poorly-paid migrant delivery workers. The original founders of Google Inc., for example, have reportedly moved themselves to low-tax Florida. “That math doesn’t math,” said Chamath Palihapitiya, a Silicon Valley investor with ethnic roots in Sri Lanka, which is a small island off of southern India. “Everyone that is potentially touched by this will now leave, and all that will result is a massive hole in California’s finances that you will be forced to fill.” The Billionaires’ Bill for Migration Some of the outraged billionaires recognize that mass migration created the political base for the wealth grab. “After blindly funding the Left for years, Silicon Valley is finally realizing what time it is. Dinner time,” said David Sacks, a California investor and author who is now advising Trump’s administration and moving his legal address to Texas. Silicon Valley is “on the menu,” he added. “The blast radius, however, of healthcare for illegal aliens, will be the end of Silicon Valley” in California, said Palihapitiya. “I care about two issues: I care about immigration and re-establishing the deterrent capacity of America,” Palantir CEO Alex Karp told the New York Times in December. “We are on the side of working-class Americans.” RELATED: Sean Duffy — Gavin Newsom’s California Is Ignoring the Law on Illegal Alien Truck Drivers “This has always been inevitable and is not due to Newsom or any individual,” said Elon Musk, who is increasingly critical of mass migration. “The Democratic Party is utterly controlled by the unions and the trial lawyers and California is a one-party state.” Those concerns were echoed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on January 12: Open immigration would be something interesting if we gave people nothing [in welfare]. Because if we gave them nothing, if they weren’t smart enough, capable, entrepreneurial enough, driven enough, they would starve to death, and so they wouldn’t stay here, they would self deport. But if you give them welfare, and you’re going to give them food stamps, and you’re gonna give them housing and you give them this, everybody’s gonna come and just leech off of us, and we’re going to pay and pay and pay. Separately, a growing number of American CEOs — including some left-wingers — are increasingly alarmed at Muslim migration into the United States. They include Larry Fink, founder of the giant BlackRock investment firm, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook and Meta, and investor David Sacks. Similarly, many writers and advocates have stepped back from full-throated advocacy for migration amid the growing clout of Islamic activists, who now include the new Mayor of New York City. Buying a Fix The billionaires are spending some of their cash to win a political fix. “It’s time for Silicon Valley to actually get involved and organized in California,” said Gerry Tan, an investor in many tech companies. “I will fight,” said Fang, the DoorDash founder who has funded many prior political battles. On January 13, they won support from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is planning his own run for President in 2028. “This will be defeated — there’s no question in my mind … I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state,” he told the New York Times, which added: While Mr. Newsom helped stop past wealth tax bills in the State Capitol, the new proposal is being driven by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West through the initiative process and beyond the reach of his veto pen. … “I want to be adamant and very clear: This is a ballot measure we are putting on the ballot,” [Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for the labor union] said. “We’re going to have voters vote on it in November.” But the billionaires have yet to offer any concessions to the many millions of American voters who have lost wages and wealth amid the billionaires’ stock-market boom and far-left political advocacy. Those wealth-sharing concessions could include elite support for ending the Extraction Migration economy that damages ordinary Americans. The billionaires might even offer curbs on the H-1B visa program that is deliberately used to push millions of American college graduates out of productive and innovative careers. “They should take the same lesson that an element of the business community took in the 1920s,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. He added: They saw the political changes related to [1920s] anarchism … and immigration, and they concluded that it might be worth paying a nickel an hour more [in wages] to have American workers instead of these kinds of political consequences. Obviously, the nickel an hour doesn’t apply anymore here, but it’s the same concept: cheap [migrant] labor not only creates a lot of welfare costs and political costs. In 1924, Congress passed an immigration reform that set the stage for the United States’ dominance in the 20th Century. Migration Grows Poverty The billionaires may be able to buy a short-term victory. But they are struggling against a self-created political tide in many states where voters have been pushed on their backs by flat wages and rising home costs caused by migration. In those states, many progressives are eager to drain vast wealth and political power from the billionaire class for their left-wing priorities. States should “follow examples like what is being proposed in Rhode Island, Michigan, and other states,” said a January 12 press statement from a union-led group titled May Day Strong. “A millionaire tax [in Massachusetts] has generated at least $5.7 billion in revenue since 2023 to pay for schools, public transit, and infrastructure,” the “Tax the Rich Policy” statement said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) is slamming the pro-migration technology donors in California, including FWD.us leader Reid Hoffman, as well as Dustin Moskovitz, Marc Andreessen, and Patrick Collison: Hoffman wants Democratic candidates to stand with the billionaires for higher [water and electricity] costs. Running on small, vague ideas that may also raise costs for families—instead of on full-throated, economic populist ideas—is a terrible plan for winning elections. In November, predicted Lynn, “anyone who isn’t a billionaire is going to eventually back this [ballot measure], because that’s how democracy works.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

The Menlo Park-based company announced the layoffs Tuesday morning in an internal memo from Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth first seen by Bloomberg. Earlier reporting from the paper cites estimates that Reality Labs employs about 15,000 workers, making the cuts roughly 10% of the division's workforce. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton wrote in a statement to state press outlet SFGate. The move was a “part of that effort,” and Meta plans to “reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,” Clayton added. Meta’s cuts arrive as the first major tech layoff of 2026, after large workforce reductions tapered off late last year. In November 2022, Meta cut about 11,000 employees in one of the largest layoffs in its history, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg simultaneously reaffirmed the company’s long-term commitment to the metaverse. The move exposed early tension between Reality Labs’ mounting losses and investor pressure for efficiency, even as Meta insisted the strategy remained intact. By the end of the same year, Meta’s metaverse push appeared to struggle due to weak user adoption, unclear consumer demand, and the growing financial drag of Reality Labs. As capital tightened and interest rates rose, the scale of the bet became harder to justify, setting the stage for the company’s current shift away from its previously heavy metaverse investment. Still, the roughly 1,000 roles being eliminated in Reality Labs represent a small fraction of the roughly 154,000 technology job losses recorded across 2025, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Technology has been pivoting to both developing and implementing artificial intelligence much more quickly than any other industry. This, coupled with over-hiring over the last decade, created a wave of job loss in the industry,” the research firm wrote. The tech sector led all private industries in layoffs last year, with job cuts rising 15% from 2024. Industry data compiled by Layoffs.fyi show that tech layoffs fell sharply into late 2025, dropping from 18,510 in October to 8,932 in November and to around 300 in December, as large, headline-scale workforce reductions tapered off heading into year-end. Among its FAANG peers, Meta’s move appears modest in scale. Amazon accounted for the largest workforce reductions within the group over the past year, cutting tens of thousands of roles across retail, devices, and AWS through multiple rounds, per layoff data sourced from public reports. Google and Microsoft implemented smaller but recurring layoffs, generally in the low thousands per round, tied to cost controls and AI-driven restructuring, while continuing to hire selectively in priority areas. Apple largely avoided mass layoffs, relying instead on attrition and slower hiring, while Netflix made limited cuts, typically numbering in the hundreds, as it adjusted operations following changes to its password-sharing model. Records on the California Employment Development Department do not yet show that a worker adjustment and retraining notice (WARN) attributed to Meta has been filed as of Wednesday morning, per Decrypt's review. The EDD “has not received any WARN notices from Meta,” a spokesperson told Decrypt after confirming with their WARN unit. Decrypt has reached out to Meta and will update this story should they respond.

Title: What Did Workers Have to Say in 2025?

Michigan’s Labor Legacy sculpture (detail), Hart Plaza, Detroit. Photo: Jeffrey St. Clair. Despite experiencing the harm of corporate greed and our collapsing social safety net firsthand, workers remain underrepresented in mainstream media. Here at Inequality.org we do our best to counteract that blind spot by publishing pieces with worker voices front and center. Not only do we give workers a platform to voice their perspectives, but we also help disseminate their opinions to newspapers and other media across America through our OtherWords editorial service. Below is a selection of the worker perspectives we published in 2025. If you’re also a worker interested in sharing your thoughts, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us at inequality@ips-dc.org. Jaz Brisack’s 2025 book “Get on the Job and Organize” traces the labor organizer’s experience from Nissan plants in the South to forming part of the nucleus taking on Starbucks to fighting for a union at Tesla. Inequality.org managing editor Chris Mills Rodrigo spoke with Brisack to discuss key takeaways from those hugely important campaigns and the path forward for the labor movement. The anti-union playbook is well rehearsed at this point: sow uncertainty among workers with propaganda and promises that employers will listen, as long as a union doesn’t get in the way. But even if workers successfully win an election, companies have a trump card in their back pockets: delay a first contract as long as possible. Registered nurses Sarah Johnson and Jason Fratangelo have experienced that tactic firsthand. Since winning an election at Michigan’s Corewell Health East in 2024, the company has used every excuse in the book to delay contract negotiations. That’s why Johnson and Fratangelo wrote a piece supporting the Faster Labor Contracts Act, which would require employers to come to the bargaining table after just 20 days. Speaking of delaying contract bargaining, that’s just what Amazon has done since workers at the company’s JFK8 facility in Staten Island shocked the country by voting to unionize in 2021. Despite the company’s intransigence, the union at the warehouse — now affiliated with the Teamsters — has been giving a critical voice to workers. When the bosses refused to do anything about a sewage leak at the facility last August, Yackisha Nebot Lopez and other workers successfully organized to demand to be sent home with pay. Assaults on worker rights came from all sides in 2025. Fran Marion, a fast food worker and organizer, detailed how a plan from Missouri lawmakers to redistrict the state would suppress working-class participation in elections and facilitate the roll-back of hard-fought labor wins. “We were already living in modern-day economic slavery,” Marion wrote. “Now they’re trying to put us in political slavery too. But we won’t let them.” When Flequer Vera was thinking about starting a business, he was worried about replicating the same economic system that he’d struggled through as a migrant worker years earlier. Inspired by a trip to Spain’s Basque Country, Vera opted for a cooperative model. The company he helped found, Sustainergy, has helped retrofit thousands of homes in the Cincinnati area to be more energy efficient. But the primary success of Sustainergy for Vera has been the family-sustaining jobs that the work has supported. Janeé Roberts was first introduced to working at Amazon via her mother, who operated a forklift at the company’s MEM6 warehouse in Mississippi. When Roberts’ mom had an aneurysm on the job, Amazon did nothing to support her recovery. Now Janeé is an organizer with the union at Amazon’s DCK6 location in San Francisco fighting for every other worker who has suffered on the job with little to no support from one of the world’s richest companies. Federal workers were the canary in the coal mine for the second Trump administration’s full frontal assault on labor rights. Before DOGE eliminated her job, Sabrina Valenti was working on coastal restoration at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to protect communities from hurricanes up until the beginning of 2025. With mass layoffs at her organization and spending cuts across the board, Valenti warns that future hurricane seasons could be even more threatening. Another federal worker who shared a personal story through Inequality.org this year was Paul Osadebe, an attorney at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Osadebe pleaded with his fellow federal workers to stay on the job as long as they could because of the critical services they provide to Americans. Later in the year, Osadebe was fired after blowing the whistle on Trump political appointees at HUD who had made it nearly impossible to effectively enforce the Fair Housing Act. Even after the infamous Wells Fargo “fake accounts” scandal of 2016, Kieran Cuadras continued to observe recklessness aimed at squeezing the bank’s employees and consumers to pump up executive paychecks. In this op-ed, the former Wells Fargo internal misconduct investigator calls for taxes on excessive CEO compensation to encourage more equitable corporate practices. Our nation’s leaders, says Cuadras, need to “do something about a CEO pay system that rewards executives with obscenely large paychecks for practices that harm workers and the broader economy.” Organizing Amazon, now America’s second-largest private employer, has been a primary goal of the labor movement. Reverend Ryan Brown was a key figure in an independent campaign to organize a warehouse in North Carolina. Before their union vote, Brown wrote for Inequality.org about the massive anti-union and surveillance campaign that Amazon was waging at his workplace. Despite losing the election this time around, workers at RDU1 outside of Raleigh and across the country are not stepping down. Worker struggles are of course not limited to this country. In February, Abiramy Sivalogananthan of the Asia Floor Wage Alliance wrote for us about a new campaign from garment workers in the Global South to improve working conditions and hold the American companies pulling in billions from exploitation accountable. Over 1,000 workers have called on their allies in the U.S. to sign onto their campaign. Child care teacher Rita Bee shared one of the bright spots of the year — New Mexico’s adoption of universal, no-cost child care. Families will save an average of $12,000 per year — a true game-changer for low-income households in one of the country’s poorest states. The state is funding the program through taxes on oil and gas extraction from public lands. “Taking care of our children and setting them up for success is the best thing we can do for our families, our communities, and our nation,” Bee wrote. This first appeared on Inequality.org. Sarah Anderson directs the Global Economy Project and co-edits Inequality.org at the Institute for Policy Studies.

Title: “And the Billionaires Are Laughing Somewhere in America”

This article by veteran war correspondent and GR associate editor Felicity Arbuthnot was first published in 2015. While the world trembles under the crescendo of bombs, “billionaires are laughing somewhere in America.” —Global Research, January 14, 2026 *** “If I could shed a tear for every home that bombs destroy, I’d never stop crying “If I could hold each shattered body, each baby stilled at birth, I’d have no time for loneliness, I’d spend all my days embracing the people of this savaged earth, “And the billionaires are laughing somewhere in America.” (Song for Basra, David Rovics.) If you have ever mentally yelled at the screen, radio or hard copy when looking for truth, fact and balance in the news and wondered how much of the mainstream media is bought or biased, the answer is simple. Just two examples, the US and UK. In the US six corporations own 90% of the media – but these corporations in turn must satisfy their shareholders – each one who holds them financial hostage to the tune of million of dollars. The list of investors is long (1) but a few examples (2013 figures): Gannett owns USA Today and local newspapers & TV stations in 37 US states including the Detroit Free Press, Indianapolis Star and Cincinnati Inquirer. Just one of many mega investors is JP Morgan Asset Management who hold 21,915,328 shares at a 2013 value of $330,702,000. In the UK there are twelve major newspaper groups: “Over a quarter (27.3 per cent) of the press is owned by Lord Rothermere and 24.9 per cent by Rupert Murdoch – between them these two men have over 50 per cent of the printed press.” (2) Figures are also from 2013. Nine of these groups are supporters of David Cameron’s Tory Party which enjoined in murdering Libya’s Leader, near all his family and small grandchildren, reducing the formerly flourishing country to a ruined, failed state – with large swathes of the British public buying into the murderous carnage thanks to the war fever drummed up by the Cameron backing media. This pattern of ownership is broadly replicated throughout the West where now the same misrepresentation of Syria is in journalistic overdrive. The BBC is vying to be leader of the pack talking of “civil war” with one Middle East correspondent even dropping the last vestige of “impartiality” and declaring “Assad must go.” The entire organization long abandoned any pretense of professionalism and impartiality even ditching his status and title of “President.” In contrast to the Mainstream media, Global Research has no $multi-million donors, but as the world again reaches yet another manufactured and most dangerous crisis, truly independent analysis is the vital weapon for the non-partisan truth, knowledge and a tool for prevention from repeating the tragedies of the past. It is, as Dr Binoy Kampmark, distinguished GR contributor and lecturer at RMIT University, Melbourne has said: “a vital democratic forum.” Of course, as Global Research writers pointed out (3) there is no “civil war” in Syria, the country’s nightmare was plotted from inside the US Embassy in Damascus in 2006 with terrorists from over ninety countries committing unspeakable atrocities, then returning to their own countries with impunity, as recent events in Paris demonstrated. Click image to donate Global Research has provided extensive coverage of the US-led war against Iraq and Syria. Obama’s fake humanitarian campaign consists in protecting the “moderate terrorists” while going after the ISIS “bad guys” who happen to be supported covertly by the CIA. Now a further excuse for another illegal onslaught against Syria is being plotted after a Russian fighter jet was shot down on Tuesday, allegedly having strayed into Turkish air space which Russia emphatically denies; moreover, the two pilots who ejected both landed in Syria. Further, as Global Research published last month (4) Turkey, incredibly, unilaterally redrew it’s border declaring five miles of Syria it’s very own “buffer zone.” The “international community” and NATO might do well to remember, that even if there were a few seconds of Russia’s aircraft in Turkish air space, a US-led “coalition” has been illegally invading Syrian air space and bombing murderously and mercilessly for the last fifteen months. Russia of course has been invited but is bombing terrorists supplied and protected by the US and their allies. In the UK David Cameron is morphing in to his pal, alleged war criminal Tony Blair and is attempting to persuade Parliament that Britain must join those illegally in Syrian air space and equally illegally drop it’s own bombs with no UN mandate for such action. The Cameron backing media is beating the war drums along with America’s partisan hacks as above. By the end of yesterday, incisive commentary was already questioning the official rhetoric – but as the year ends, the funds for this ground breaking site need replenishing. As the excellent “Ants and Grasshoppers” (see 1) points out: “Just like a politician is likely to push laws onto the books that represent his/her biggest campaign donors, newspapers will push ideologies that are the most friendly and agreeable to their shareholders.” Global Research does it in unwavering passion and commitment to a saner world. * Felicity Arbuthnot is a distinguished author, veteran war correspondent and Global Research contributor Notes 1. http://ants-and-grasshoppers.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/who-owns-major-newspapers-detailed-list.html 2. http://leftfootforward.org/2013/06/everyone-should-know-who-owns-the-press-for-the-sake-of-our-democracy/ 3. http://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-and-conspiracy-theories-it-is-a-conspiracy/29596 4. http://www.globalresearch.ca/russia-violated-turkish-airspace-because-turkey-moved-its-border/5480430 Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page Become a Member of Global Research Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

Infosys reported better-than-expected third-quarter ‍revenue on Wednesday, helped by a ‌pickup in tech demand from its financial services clients. The IT major’s revenue rose 8.9% ⁠to ₹45,479 crore in the October-December period. Analysts ⁠on average had estimated revenue of ₹45,227 crore, according to ‌data compiled by LSEG. Infosys reported better-than-expected third-quarter ‍revenue on ​Wednesday, helped by a ‌pickup ​in tech demand from its financial services clients. Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty declined on Wednesday, extending their previous day’s losses, due to weakness in IT, consumption, and select banking blue-chip stocks amid escalating geopolitical tensions. Besides, persistent foreign fund outflows and fresh tariff-related uncertainties also unnerved investors, traders said. The 30-share BSE Sensex dropped 244.98 points, or 0.29 per cent, to settle at 83,382.71. During the day, it fell 442.49 points or 0.52 per cent to 83,185.20. The 50-share NSE Nifty declined 66.70 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 25,665.60. Stock markets decline for the second day as Sensex drops 245 points amid IT and banking sector weaknesses. The rupee pared initial gains and settled for the day 6 paise lower at 90.29 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, as the likely central bank intervention was negated by a strong dollar, foreign outflows from capital markets, and elevated crude oil prices.

Oswal Pumps Ltd has received an order from Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd (KREDL) under the PM-KUSUM B Scheme for the supply and installation of 3,263 off-grid DC solar photovoltaic water pumping systems with a total order value of ₹119.92 crore (inclusive of GST). The firm will supply and instal 3,263 off-grid DC solar photovoltaic water pumping systems under the PM-KUSUM B Scheme India’s fiscal policy set to stop being contractionary… The Ministry of Finance is set to unveil its budget for FY2026-27 on 1 February 2026, and this budget comes in the light of the Finance Ministry being reasonably well placed to hit its fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP, despite a low nominal GDP growth and deep tax cuts, both for personal income tax and goods & services tax. The expenditure side, too, saw a strong come back, with capex spending rising rapidly in terms of execution, and lower energy prices giving space for containing subsidies. For FY27, we see the government broadly maintaining the current deficit, modestly reducing it to 4.3% of GDP for FY27, while capex spending targets should broadly move in sync with nominal GDP growth, which bounces back to 10.1% yoy in FY27 in our view. …and move to a debt targeting framework The Ministry of Finance is on track to hit its medium-term fiscal target of below 4.5% of GDP it had set in 2021 for the fiscal deficit and is going to pivot to a debt sustainability framework from FY27, targeting 55% of central debt to GDP, down from an estimated 56.1% of debt in FY26. This would make the fiscal position less contractionary, but maintain fiscal sustainability, ensuring spending rises broadly in sync with the nominal growth cycle, and not a drag on economic activity. Revenue projections to undershoot in FY26 From a revenue perspective, the dual tax cuts from income tax and GST will add some stress (2% lower than BE in our view), but the surge in non-tax revenues, both dividends from RBI and other public sector enterprises will make up for some of the shortfall. While the GST compensation cess has been phased put as per the recent reforms, we expect savings of Rs 350bn for FY26 basis the repayment schedule of the back-to-back loans. Still, we see scope for revenue growth to rise by 10.7% yoy, aided by reasonable growth in direct taxes, mild recovery in GST and higher provisions for dividends (RBI dividend to be ~INR 2.9trn as per our est.) and divestment inflows. With this, we see the overall revenue to GDP ratio rising to 9.6%, modestly up from 9.5% in FY26. The new revenue assumptions also will have the 16th Finance Commission recommendations incorporated, which we see largely remaining unchanged in terms of devolution. Spending mix to see defence, capex prioritized Unlike FY25, FY26 has seen a major surge in capex spending in H1FY26, but trends are expected to normalise in H2FY26. We expect some overshoot of the capex spending in FY26 (additional defence spending, +2% vs BE). We see capex allocations growing to INR12.5trn (3.2% of GDP) in FY27, and with energy prices coming off, the subsidy bills are likely to move sideways in FY27, at best. Further within capex government’s focus could remain intact in a few strategic areas: Defence, Railways & Shipbuilding while roads, rails and housing could remain subdued in FY27. We do not see the government budgeting for the eight-pay commission in FY27, which we believe will come into effect in installments in FY28-FY29, which over a year will cost the government around INR 2.4-2.8trn (0.54% - 0.65% of GDP) but split between FY28 and FY29. Further the changes proposed in VB-G RAM G may also implies some savings for the Centre. “As India approaches the Education Budget 2026, Artificial Intelligence must move from the margins to the core of education policy and funding. Though access and digital adoption have increased, the next wave of reform must be AI-enabled learning outcomes, faculty upskilling, and curriculum modernisation. Strategic budgetary support is required to integrate AI across disciplines, not as a mere technical subject, but as a managerial, ethical, and decision-making tool that future leaders need to master. More significantly, investments in AI-driven research, simulation-based learning, and industry-academia collaboration will massively increase employability and innovation capacity. The other important aspect is funding in teacher training, data infrastructure, and responsible AI frameworks to ensure inclusive and ethical adoption. A forward-looking budget embedding AI into the education ecosystem will be critical in building globally competitive institutions and future-ready talent for India’s knowledge economy.” “The importance of MSMEs is growing at a fast pace in the economy. The industry is infact emerging as a key pillar supporting India’s manufacturing renaissance in the defence sector and beyond. In areas such as drone manufacturing and unmanned systems, targeted capex incentives, output-linked support, rationalised taxation and R&D enablement can help MSMEs scale indigenous technologies and accelerate adoption. From a policy standpoint, the upcoming Budget must focus on execution and scale by lowering entry barriers for high-tech MSMEs, speeding up procurement cycles and creating stable demand visibility in defence manufacturing. Strengthening access to financing, encouraging advanced manufacturing investments and deepening domestic value addition will help MSMEs move up the value chain and advance India’s self-reliance goals while positioning the country as a global hub for defence and drone technologies.” Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) and a subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) on Wednesday announced an oil discovery in Onshore Block 1, Abu Dhabi. The discovery happened on Tuesday. IOCL and BPCL announce a significant oil discovery in Abu Dhabi's Onshore Block 1, marking a major achievement in exploration. Ola Electric on Wednesday announced the expansion of its 4680 Bharat Cell platform. As part of the initiative, businesses and start-ups can now directly purchase the 4680 Bharat Cells, or the 1.5kWh 4680 Bharat Cell battery pack for application across automotive, humanoids, drones, and portable medical equipment. Ola Electric expands its 4680 Bharat Cell platform, empowering start-ups and businesses with innovative energy storage solutions for various applications. The government’s continued focus on strengthening domestic manufacturing and improving ease of doing business has created a strong foundation for sectors such as packaging. For glass manufacturers, further rationalisation of duties and calibrated safeguard mechanisms on key raw materials like soda ash can help ensure long-term supply stability and support capacity expansion. Glass and aluminium manufacturing are energy-intensive processes, and targeted incentives for energy efficiency, cleaner fuel adoption and technology upgrades will encourage faster transition while improving cost efficiency across the sector. There is also a significant opportunity to further strengthen India’s circular economy. Glass and aluminium are infinitely recyclable, and fiscal support for organised collection, segregation and recycling infrastructure will help increase recycled content, reduce resource dependence, and enhance global competitiveness. Such measures in the upcoming Union Budget will enable packaging manufacturers to invest with confidence and reinforce India’s position as a reliable hub for sustainable glass and aluminium packaging. Sustainability/ MSMEs Neha Juneja, Founding Member IndiaP2P & EquiRize We expect the Budget to advance initiatives and incentives that improve MSME credit access and accelerate green economy investments aligned with India’s SDG priorities. MSMEs account for ~30% of GDP, ~45% of exports, and over 20 Cr. jobs, yet face a credit gap exceeding ₹20 lakh crore. Addressing this through credit impetus and compliance rationalisation can materially lift employment and export competitiveness. Increased policy support for renewables, green mobility, and clean cooking sectors, which together represent $50Bn+ in annual investment potential, will strengthen medium to long term economic and climate resilience and meet our national green targets for 2030. Insurance Ankita Srivastava, General Manager – Growth & Strategy at THIP (The Healthy Indian Project) “Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, India’s health and life insurance sector stands at a pivotal moment. While GST exemptions have improved affordability and demand, long-term growth will depend on deeper structural reforms. Enhanced tax incentives, stronger micro-insurance frameworks, simplified distribution, and robust consumer protection are critical. Recent FDI liberalisation adds momentum, but the budget’s policy direction will ultimately shape penetration, innovation, and public trust.” Lending/ Finance Neha Juneja, Founding Member, IndiaP2P & EquiRize The lending sector is seeking measures that encourage the unlocking of alternative capital sources for the sector, including from retail investors. Measures such as rationalisation of TDS on listed NCDs, increased limits for RBI-regulated P2P lending, will lead to flexibility and scale in capital sourcing for NBFCs and direct lending. Health & Pharma Sudipta Sengupta, Founder & CEO, The Healthy Indian Project (THIP) As India prepares its annual budget, my key expectation is clarity and courage in supporting preventive healthcare startups. Global AI platforms like ChatGPT Health will inevitably reshape consumer health information, but without policy support, they risk overwhelming homegrown players who understand India’s realities far better. Preventive health is not just a business opportunity; it is a national necessity. I hope the government creates incentives, grants, and regulatory safeguards that empower Indian startups to innovate responsibly, compete fairly, and build trusted health ecosystems rooted in evidence, ethics, and accessibility. Vigneshkumar Dhandapani, Associate Vice President, Avalon Consulting (Pharma) “A few critical outcomes that the Indian pharma industry expects from the 2026 Union Budget: - Increase healthcare spend to 2.5% of GPD as per NHP 2017 long-standing targets, up from 1.9% of GDP in FY25. - Correction of the inverted duty structure is critical as inputs currently have higher GST rates than the finished products. Contract manufacturers and generic MSME drug manufacturers are heavily affected. ‘GST rate rationalisation’ or mandating full ITC refund holds the key. - Bulk Drugs PLI 1.0 covered 41 APIs; however, the industry awaits clarity on the scope of Rs. 15,000 Cr. Pharma PLI. Widening the net of APIs to reduce >60% dependency on China is critical and needs to be covered. - R&D is a key success enabler for the industry. Revival of 200% weighted R&D deduction would motivate the pharma firms to invest more in cutting-edge drugs/products.” Justdial, India’s No. 1 local search engine, reported a consistent performance for the third quarter of FY26 marked by steady execution across its core business while continuing to deepen its AI-led platform capabilities. During the quarter, the company posted a revenue of ₹305.7 crores, marking a YoY increase of 6.4%, while operating EBITDA stood at ₹95.2 crores, registering a YoY growth of 10.0%. Net profit stood at ₹118.0 crores, supported by disciplined cost management and stable operating performance. User and merchant engagement on the platform remained steady, with 184.5 million unique visitors recorded during the quarter and total business listings crossing 52.8 million as of 31st December 2025, underscoring Justdial’s continued relevance as India’s go-to platform for local business discovery. Mr. Shwetank Dixit, Chief Growth Officer, Just Dial, commented: “In the quarter gone by, we continued to evolve Justdial into a more intelligent, AI and automation-led platform. A key area of progress during the quarter was our move towards agentic AI, enabling the automation of critical workflows, including AI-driven analysis of user calls to businesses to identify genuine category-level intent and automatically create qualified leads, along with AI deployment across backend operations and sales functions. Looking ahead, we plan to deploy agentic AI–powered voice and chat interfaces across sales, customer support, and data verification, while embedding AI deeply into our search experience to enable more intuitive, conversational discovery. Together, these initiatives are simplifying how businesses manage their digital presence while making local discovery faster and more intuitive for our users.” Piramal Finance Limited, a leading Retail-led diversified NBFC, has raised USD 350 million in multilateral financing from two of the world’s most respected development finance institutions (DFIs) — the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) — reaffirming strong institutional confidence in the company’s strategy, governance and responsible growth trajectory. The funding package comprises: USD 200 million from IFC, and USD 150 million from ADB, under its Sustainable Finance Framework. The facilities carry a tenor of five years and will be drawn in tranches between January and March 2026, in line with regulatory guidelines. The company is also in advanced discussions to secure an additional USD 150 million from select DFIs, taking the total multilateral fundraising pipeline up to USD 500 million. This marks Piramal Finance’s inaugural DFI borrowing, further strengthening its diversified and long-term funding profile. Sees policy continuity over big-bang moves in Union Budget 2026 Mumbai, 14th January 2026: According to smallcase managers, Indian equity markets are entering 2026 on a firmer footing after a year of consolidation, with improving valuations, realistic earnings expectations and strong domestic fundamentals shaping a more constructive outlook. The three women smallcase managers Sonam Srivastava, Founder of Wright Research, Prachi Deuskar, Co-founder, Lotusdew Wealth and Investment Advisors, and Sneha Jain - Founder & CEO, WealthTrust Capital Services believes that while global events could be a source of uncertainty, India’s macro fundamentals remain strong. The smallcase managers believes that the coming year is likely to reward earnings-led investing rather than momentum-driven trades. They project a strong consumption-led growth cycle in 2026, supported by moderate inflation, tax cuts, GST reductions, and interest-rate cuts that boost disposable incomes and ease borrowing conditions. Commenting on the road ahead, Sonam Srivastava, smallcase Manager and Founder of Wright Research, said, “CY25 was a year of digestion rather than disappointment. After the strong post-COVID rally, Indian equities spent most of the year consolidating, with returns becoming narrower and more selective. As we move into CY26 which structurally is more constructive than CY25, valuations look far more reasonable today, earnings expectations are realistic rather than euphoric, and India enters the year with macro stability. We expect returns to be earnings-led in CY26 rather than multiple-led, which favours disciplined stock selection and factor-driven strategies.” She added that mid-teens earnings growth for Nifty companies, combined with improving sector breadth, makes the medium-term risk–reward more attractive despite global uncertainties. Sneha Jain, smallcase Manager, Founder & CEO, WealthTrust Capital Services said, “After the valuation reset in 2025, large caps, traditionally the premium P/B cohort, are now trading below SMIDs on a price-to-book basis — an inversion that signals subdued expectations despite superior balance-sheet strength, cash flows and governance. This provides valuation comfort and makes large caps relatively more attractive over the next 6–8 months, though allocations should remain aligned to overall asset allocation, with large caps serving as a stability anchor rather than a tactical overweight.” Budget Expectations: Women managers expects continuity over Big-Bang Announcements The managers say that Women investors and managers are not looking for headline-grabbing announcements, but for continuity. Fiscal discipline, sustained infrastructure spending, support for manufacturing and MSMEs, and clarity on long-term capital gains taxation matter more than short-term incentives. Any measures that deepen capital markets, improve retirement savings participation, or increase financial inclusion for women would be structurally positive. They expect the upcoming Union Budget to focus on continuity and structural support rather than short-term stimuli. They say that policy stability will be more critical than headline-grabbing measures. According to Prachi Deuskar, smallcase Manager and Co-founder, Lotusdew Wealth and Investment Advisors, “We anticipate the Union Budget will reinforce policy continuity around infrastructure, formalization, and fiscal prudence, alongside measures to deepen household financial participation. We also expect some support measures for the MSMEs, such as easier access to finance, credit guarantees, and incentives to boost productivity and market access. Structural incentives for manufacturing, long-term savings products, and policies that enhance ease of investing and compliance are likely to strengthen investor confidence and broaden market participation.” She noted that measures improving ease of investing, access to credit and long-term savings participation would be particularly constructive for sustained wealth creation. Sectors to watch in CY26: Quality, Capex and Selective Growth Experts believe sector leadership in 2026 will remain selective, with quality and balance-sheet strength taking precedence over broad-based rallies. They added that that valuation dispersion across market segments is creating opportunities, particularly within large caps. Sonam Srivastava highlighted that financials, capital goods and manufacturing-linked sectors remain central to the investment narrative. She highlights that well-capitalised private banks and select NBFCs continue to benefit from steady credit growth and stable asset quality. Industrials, capital goods and defence are supported by the multi-year capex cycle. Manufacturing-linked themes such as EMS, auto ancillaries and specialty chemicals are becoming more selective but attractive at corrected valuations. Technology services could offer incremental upside as global demand stabilises. Consumption recovery is likely to be gradual rather than sharp. Sneha Jain bets more on Information Technology and Precious Metals. She notes that The earnings yield of CNX IT has inched below the US 10yr Bond yield. Markets are pricing Indian IT similar to a Bond expecting low to no growth. Any growth in Indian IT sector should lead to rerating. On other hand, the gold–silver ratio, which was the primary indicator behind our silver call, has reverted to its historical median, suggesting silver now looks fairly overvalued at current prices. At the current ratio, gold offers a higher implied 1-year forward return than silver, reflecting relatively better risk-reward at this juncture. While, Prachi Deuskar believes that Capital goods, industrial and defence sectors stand to benefit from ongoing infrastructure capex and supply-chain shifts. She notes that select consumption segments and healthcare demonstrate resilient demand, while niche IT and technology service providers with differentiated offerings could outperform as digital adoption grows. While, FMCG sector is reporting signs of demand recovery and double-digit earnings growth, underpinned by improving core consumption trends. Budget Expectations – What must not be overlooked. India today does not suffer from a lack of intent or ambition in defence manufacturing. Over the years, industry has developed meaningful capabilities, created robust infrastructure, and nurtured specialised talent aligned with clearly identified defence priorities. What now requires equal attention is the sustainability of this ecosystem as it moves from promise to performance. The cost and risk borne by industry in taking a technology beyond early production are often underestimated. From practical experience, the most fragile phase of any defence programme is the transition from initial production to scale. This is the stage at which development timelines tend to stretch, costs escalate due to refinements and testing, and programme momentum can weaken. Similarly, capital investments made by industry in defence manufacturing are inherently long term in nature and expenditure is uneven across budget cycles. Hence disrupts capacity planning, quality systems, compliances, and after-sales support though the overall budget allocation appears stable. On the exports front, there is today genuine global interest in sourcing defence systems from India. However, exporting defence equipment cannot be treated as an extension of domestic procurement. To be credible in international markets, industry must invest upfront in regulatory compliance, certifications, disciplined documentation practices, and long-term maintenance and support infrastructure. A Union Budget that recognises these realities, without micromanaging execution, can strengthen national security while creating long-term economic value. “As we look ahead to Budget 2026, retail and bond investors alike are keenly focused on fiscal consolidation and credible deficit guidance. A disciplined glide path toward narrower deficits not only helps keep government bond yields steady but also creates conditions for Indian corporates to tap the debt markets with greater confidence. Increased corporate borrowing via bonds can meaningfully boost capital formation and support broader economic growth. On the tax front, I do not expect major changes in direct or indirect taxes, other than clarifications, since both regimes have undergone significant reform over the last 12 months.” “With the Union Budget 2026-27 approaching, the rail sector is entering a phase where execution and reform will matter as much as headline allocations. The Railways Minister’s ‘52 Reforms in 52 Weeks’ programme signals a clear push toward system-wide improvements in operations, safety, and service delivery. Based on recent trends, the rail outlay is expected to see a calibrated increase of around five percent, taking the overall allocation to approximately ₹2.65 lakh crore, including extra-budgetary resources. With electrification nearing completion, capital deployment is likely to be redirected toward easing congestion through new lines, gauge conversion, track doubling, and the expansion of Dedicated Freight Corridors and economic corridors linked to ports and mineral clusters. The reform agenda’s focus on faster adoption of artificial intelligence and advanced technologies for safety, predictive maintenance, and train operations is particularly encouraging, as it reflects a shift from asset creation alone to measurable performance outcomes. From an industry standpoint, continued capital support, regulatory simplification, deeper private sector involvement, and a more enabling framework for public-private partnerships will determine how effectively policy intent translates into on-ground execution. The forthcoming Budget should therefore focus on converting reform intent into projects that directly reduce congestion and lift operating efficiency across the rail network.” Rajat Bokolia, CEO, Newstone, says, “As the Union Budget 2026 approaches on February 1st, Tier II cities like Sonipat are becoming top real estate investment spots. Tier II cities offer affordable prices compared to Tier-1 cities. Sonipat leads this trend in the NCR. Better connectivity, RRTS, Metro extensions, UER-II, and the Sonipat Master Plan 2031 attract homebuyers as well as developers. Sonipat offers affordable options compared to Gurugram or Noida, along with rising job opportunities. The key expectations from the budget are that it might raise affordable housing limits, increase home loan tax deductions, and reduce GST/Stamp duties. This would drive more growth in tier-II cities like Sonipat. Investors could see post-budget price rises making Tier-II cities a smart investment choice.” Abhay Mishra, President & CEO, Jindal Realty, says , “The upcoming Union Budget 2026 should recognise that India’s housing momentum is now led by Tier-II cities rather than just metros. With better infrastructure and stable prices, these markets can grow faster if the budget boosts urban infrastructure spending, gives tax support to homebuyers, and encourages affordable housing. Sonipat, an emerging NCR hotspot, is benefiting from expressway connectivity, Namo Bharat, and industrial growth, which is driving homebuyers’ demand. If the budget channels more funds and policy attention to cities like Sonipat, it can firmly position growing economic hubs of India as the real driver of the country’s real estate growth.” - Yashank Wason, Managing Director, Royal Green Realty, says, “The upcoming fiscal budget is a crucial opportunity to strengthen real estate, especially in fast-growing Tier II and III cities, which are now effectively challenging metros across segments. These markets are offering infra-led projects, superior amenities and more spacious homes at comparatively reasonable prices, drawing both end-users and investors. Major developers are entering these cities, supported by government policy easing and recent GST relief, helping people enjoy better lifestyles in their hometowns while easing migration pressures. The industry now expects further tax incentives, clarity on GST and continued policy support to sustain safe, long-term real estate investments.” Navdeep Sardana, Founder, Whiteland Corporation says, “The upcoming 2026 union budget is the most anticipated day for Indian real estate. While 2025 saw absorptions in office and premium real estate sectors, there has been a policy push for these segments. The premium segment is looking for a fiscal maturity. With premium real estate now the current trend, industry’s focus has moved beyond tax sops. The most critical expectation for the ultra HNIs is the re-evaluation of Rs 10 crore cap on capital gains reinvestment under sections 54 and 54F. Increasing this limit is important to facilitate the movement of uber-luxury properties. Moreover, we expect the union budget to propel ESG compliant luxury developments and smart housing technology integration via specialised green financing tax credits. Industry expects the budget to introduce policies simplifying availability of finance for developers, providing better liquidity and lower barriers. For NRI investors, a further rationalisation of TDS on property sales would significantly improve foreign capital inflows into India’s growing residential market, which is expected to dominate the 2026 landscape.” Rajan Yadav, Director, Roots Developers, says, “On February 1, 2025, the union budget is expected to provide measures to improve the real estate segment. The industry seeks tax deductions on home loan interest, better subsidies for buyers, and disbursements to reduce EMIs and risks. Such steps can drive growth and urban development while restoring demand in luxury segments. In luxury real estate, sustained demand from HNIs and NRIs will ensure project placement with wellness amenities and ESG compliances, even without direct incentives. A buyer centric budget will make housing purchases more attractive while maintaining luxury real estate’s strong performance.” Mr. Rishabh Periwal, Senior Vice President, Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. says, “According to the latest Cushman & Wakefield report, Delhi-NCR recorded a strong 39% quarter-on-quarter rise in new housing launches in Q4 2025, reflecting sustained buyer confidence. Gurugram led this growth, accounting for a significant share of launches along key growth corridors such as Dwarka Expressway, Golf Course Extension Road, and New Gurugram. With enhanced connectivity to IGI Airport, Delhi, and major commercial hubs like Yashobhoomi and Cyber City, these infrastructure-led developments are reshaping the region’s residential landscape. Homebuyers and investors should focus on such emerging, well-connected micro-markets for long-term value appreciation.” One of the most welcome reforms in 2025 was the government’s decision to remove GST on life insurance. This has made life insurance about 18% more affordable, encouraging more people to secure their families’ futures. While insurers have faced increased operational costs due to the loss of Input Tax Credit (ITC), I am hopeful that increased demand driven by better affordability will help offset this impact. For the upcoming Union Budget, we have three key expectations that will not only benefit the life insurance industry but also help improve financial security for millions of Indians: 1. Better Tax Benefits for Protection and Health Insurance To accelerate insurance penetration and achieve the vision of ‘Insurance for All by 2047’, we are hopeful that the government will consider enhancing tax benefits on life and health insurance. Specifically, we recommend either increasing the current limit or introducing a separate, dedicated section for life insurance premiums. It is also crucial that these tax benefits be extended to both the old and new tax regimes, making insurance more inclusive and accessible to all. 2. Tax Relief on Annuity Plans India is facing a widening retirement savings gap, projected to reach $85 trillion by 2050 [1] .We need to do something to fill this gap. To tackle this, the budget this year can: Extend the ₹50,000 deduction to all pension and annuity products. Reduce tax on annuity payouts, making retirement income more tax-efficient and attractive for savers. Simplifying and enhancing tax benefits for these products will encourage more Indians to invest in long-term income security. 3. Increase Premium Cap for tax-free maturity for ULIPs to ₹5 lakh Today, ULIPs have a ₹2.5 lakh annual premium cap for tax-free maturity. We hope the Budget will raise the ULIP cap to ₹5 lakh, same as traditional products. A uniform cap will make tax benefits easier to understand for everyone. With continued policy support and forward-thinking reforms, the life insurance sector is ready to play a stronger role in safeguarding financial well-being and enabling long-term security for Indian families. “The GST waiver has made life insurance more affordable and accessible. We’re hopeful that this year’s Budget will continue that momentum. Better tax benefits for protection and health plans—under both tax regimes—can help more families get covered. We also hope to see stronger support for pension products and an increase in the premium cap for ULIPs to Rs. 5 Lakh, similar to traditional plans. Simple, inclusive reforms can go a long way in securing India’s financial future and accelerate progress towards ‘Insurance for All by 2047.’” With the pre-Budget approaching, we are hopeful that India is entering an important phase in its medical tourism journey. Policy reforms are recognising medical value travel as a structured, systems-led growth opportunity. Continued investments in healthcare infrastructure, expanding digital health adoption, and improving access for international patients have created a strong foundation. The next phase of growth will depend on clearer policy direction and faster, simpler medical visa processes, along with well-defined cross-border care pathways and patient facilitation standards that reduce uncertainty for families planning treatment. Medical tourism is a multi-billion-dollar global industry, and India is well positioned to strengthen its leadership with world-class clinicians, advanced hospital networks, and a compelling value proposition centred on outcomes, affordability, and patient experience. Going forward, international patients will increasingly expect transparency, continuity of care, and seamless coordination throughout treatment, travel, and recovery. Strengthening digital health integration, enabling insurance alignment, and supporting accredited patient facilitation platforms will be critical to building trust. Looking to 2026, with the right policy support, India can extend medical tourism beyond metro cities into emerging healthcare hubs, building a more inclusive and resilient ecosystem. “As India’s digital payments ecosystem continues to expand, the Union Budget plays an essential role in reinforcing infrastructure, security, and regulatory clarity. Policies that support secure digital adoption, ease compliance for MSMEs, and encourage innovation can help sustain growth across the fintech sector. For payment aggregators, stable regulatory frameworks and technology-focused incentives are key to scaling responsibly while maintaining trust. Continued focus on cybersecurity, data protection, and ease of doing business will strengthen the overall payments landscape. The direction set through the Budget will influence how fintech players contribute to financial inclusion and build a resilient digital economy in the coming years.” NITCO Limited, a leading player in the tiles, marble, and mosaic industry, has reported a strong 85% growth in sales in December 2025 as compared to January 2025, on a month-on-month basis, reflecting strong business momentum and sustained demand across its product categories. The growth was driven by focused execution, strengthening market presence, and growing customer confidence, marking a significant milestone in NITCO’s journey towards scalable and sustainable growth. Sales momentum was supported by strong customer demand, ongoing product portfolio enhancement, improved distribution reach, and sustained operational efficiencies. Commenting on the performance, Mr. Vivek Talwar, Chairman & Managing Director, NITCO Limited, said, “Achieving 85% growth in sales reflects the strength of our business strategy, the dedication of our teams, and the trust our customers have placed in us. We remain focused on sustainable growth while continuing to invest in innovation, capacity expansion, and customer experience.” Fusion CX, a global customer experience (CX) services provider, today announced the acquisition of Skycom BPO, an El Salvador–based nearshore BPO company with delivery operations across Latin America.

The non-trade prices saw a sharp correction post the GST cut (especially in the South and North), though it recovered partly in Dec-25 along with sequential demand pick up. While the industry’s realisation growth is likely to decline c2% q-q in 3Q, dealers cite optimism of potential price hikes (both trade and non-trade) ahead along with seasonal recovery. · Strong demand pick-up in Dec-25; Heading firm into a seasonally strong 4Q: The industry’s 3Q volume growth rebounded to high single digit, in our view, post a 4-5% growth witnessed in 1HFY26, as construction activities resumed from end Nov-25. Driven by a ramp-up in newly acquired capacities and organic additions, we estimate c15% y-y volume growth for our coverage, led by UTCEM (c21% y-y; c13% LFL), ACEM (c13% y-y) and JKCE (c14%), but a subdued volume growth for SRCM (c3% y-y). · Operating costs to soften q-q; but lower realisations are likely to impact profitability: In 3Q, the average US petcoke prices remained elevated at cUSD120/ton, i.e., close to the Sep-25 exit (+c4% q-q/ c21% y-y), which is likely to exert pressure on P&F costs, though partly offset by the decline in imported coal (South Africa) prices (-c2% q-q) and higher green energy mix. Overall, we expect operating cost/ton to soften c1% q-q owing to operating leverage and the reversal of elevated 2Q fixed cost but see a cINR50/ton q-q decline in EBITDA/ton on lower pricing and subsidy income. · Sector EV/EBITDA near its past 10-year average; Upgrade DALBHARA to Neutral: Prolonged demand weakness stretching to mid-3Q eroded price stability in the previous quarter. However, the recent demand pick-up has raised the probability of near-term price hikes. In our base case, we expect 3Q slippages to recover but don’t see a meaningful hike in 4Q, amidst a year-end volume push. Our preference remains UTCEM and JKCE. We upgrade DALBHARA to Neutral. Strong 2025; compounding should continue in 2026 We have been positive on Indian Telecoms for a while, and telecoms remains among our preferred sector pick in India in 2026 (See 2026 Outlook). The telecom industry’s structure has improved, which is reflected in strong revenue growth over the past years, EBITDA margin improvement and a moderating capex intensity. While valuation multiples have expanded, we expect healthy doubledigit returns led by earnings growth. We see a strong likelihood of a mobile tariff hike in 2026, and the sector is tapping new growth drivers, such as home broadband and data centres. Telcos have ramped up their consumer offering by bundling content, cloud and AI, which can eventually be monetised. We like Reliance and Bharti Airtel. We recently downgraded Indus Towers to Neutral. · 2026 should be an eventful year: Jio IPO, tariff hikes, AGR resolution, Indus dividends: We expect 2026 to be an eventful year for the Indian Telecom industry and would watch out for 1) Jio Platforms IPO, which could raise the weightage of the sector in indices; 2) We see high likelihood of a mobile tariff hike in 1H2026; 3) the DoT recently provided relief to VIL on its AGR dues. However, we do not expect this to have any meaningful impact on the Indian mobile market share trends in 2026; 4) non-mobile opportunities, such as home and data center, could see an increase in the share of capex. Increasing adoption of digital services, such as cloud and AI services, creates differentiation opportunities in the near-term (e.g. Jio bundling Google AI Pro) and a possible monetisation opportunity in the medium term. · 3QFY26 should be a relatively stable quarter; healthy growth on the back of stable tariffs: On account of stable India mobile tariffs for over a year, we expect largely stable q-q revenue trends (+2-2.5% q-q for Airtel and Jio). On a y-y basis, sales growth should remain strong and in double digits (c10-11% for Jio/Airtel). EBITDA growth should remain ahead of sales growth for both Airtel and Jio. For Indus, the AGR dues relief for VIL is a positive. However, we recently downgraded the stock to Neutral as the stock has moved by 35% over 1Y and our concerns of weak growth and high maintenance capex keeps us from raising the valuation multiples. As India prepares for the Union Budget, there is a crucial opportunity to reorient healthcare towards prevention and early intervention. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) continue to place a growing burden on individuals, families and public health systems, yet many conditions remain undetected until advanced stages. Strengthening structured screening programmes and enabling technology-led risk assessment can help identify disease earlier, improve outcomes and reduce avoidable hospitalisation. Targeted policy support for preventive health infrastructure, workforce training and data-driven screening models can optimise long-term healthcare spending while easing pressure on tertiary care facilities. Encouraging public-private collaboration and integrating preventive screening into primary care pathways will be key to building a more sustainable system. A forward-looking budget that prioritises early detection, personalised risk profiling and preventive care can help India move from a treatment-centric approach to a healthier, more resilient population. This shift will support affordability, equity, productivity, and long-term national well-being across diverse communities nationwide and sustainably. Wholesale Price Inflation (WPI), based on provisional estimates, increased marginally to 0.71% on a month-on-month (M-o-M) basis in December 2025, compared to 0.52% in November 2025, while continuing to remain below the 1% mark, said Mr. Rajeev Juneja, President, PHDCCI, in a press statement issued here today. The marginal uptick in WPI was primarily driven by higher inflation in the Fuel & Power and Manufactured Products groups on a month-on-month basis, he highlighted. Inflation in the Fuel and Power category (weight: 13.15%) rose from 0.90% in November 2025 to 1.23% in December 2025, reflecting increased prices of electricity (4.46%), coal (0.66%), and mineral oils (0.07%) during the month, Mr. Juneja noted. The Manufactured Products group (weight: 64.23%) witnessed an uptrend, moving from a deflation of (-) 0.21% in November 2025 to an inflation of 0.41% in December 2025 on a month-on-month basis. This increase was attributed to higher prices in the manufacture of basic metals, chemicals and chemical products, non-metallic mineral products, textiles, cement, lime and plaster, he added. Dr. Ranjeet Mehta, CEO & Secretary General, PHDCCI, stated that WPI inflation is expected to remain range-bound, supported by benign international crude oil prices, GST rate rationalisation, and healthy rabi crop production. India’s pro-growth pivot takes hold As we write our outlook for India’s economy into 2026, our market call sees Nifty at 30,000 by Mar-27, yielding 15% return vs. 10.1% in CY25, despite global headwinds. This is premised on earnings rebound (14-15% growth in FY27E; 3-5% in FY26E), led by acceleration in sales growth from 6.9% in FY26E to 10.9% in FY27E, and PAT growth from 10.9% in FY26E to 13.3% in FY27E. The earnings uptick will be led by a rebound in nominal GDP growth (earnings sensitivity to GDP growth is ~0.6) and built on a durable foundation of higher incremental free cash flow and improving balance sheet optionality. Expect nominal GDP to grow 10.5% YoY in FY27E from 8.5% YoY in FY26E. EM assets have higher tailwinds in CY26 than DMs: EM assets have higher tailwinds versus DMs – easy financial conditions, moderate inflation, soft DXY and valuation comfort. The asset class leadership is also shifting. The AI theme is past its easy beta phase (selective gains from uniform winners, announcement-led rally to proof of revenue and ROI) and dominance of the US market is dissipating, providing space for under-owned markets and contra-AI trade. India’s relative valuation premium to its EM peers is closer to historical inflection point (1.6x), and an uptick in nominal GDP growth should aid FPI inflows. In past 25 years, peak-to-trough (drawdown) cycles of net FPI equity inflows have been strongly correlated with nominal GDP growth. We see conditions in India being prime for return of FPI inflows. SBI Life launches ‘SBI Life- Smart Platina Advantage’, a life insurance guaranteed savings plan for long-term financial confidence – ‘SBI Life- Smart Platina Advantage’ is designed to seamlessly support financial needs across life stages with assured, long-term savings and protection India, 14th January 2025: In today’s fast-changing world—where aspirations grow alongside responsibilities—financial security is no longer just about finances, but about certainty, peace of mind, and the ability to protect loved ones through every phase of life. Recognising this need, SBI Life Insurance, one of India’s most trusted private life insurers, launched ‘SBI Life – Smart Platina Advantage’, an individual, non-linked, non-participating life insurance savings product that offers long-term guaranteed benefits along with life insurance protection throughout the policy term. Designed to help individuals plan confidently for life’s milestones—be it children’s education, retirement planning, corpus creation, building second income etc., —SBI Life – Smart Platina Advantage enables individuals to build a disciplined financial corpus with assured guaranteed additions every policy year. The product combines predictability with flexibility, ensuring one to secure defined maturity outcomes while paying premiums for a limited duration. Key features of SBI Life – Smart Platina Advantage are: · Long-term Guaranteed Benefits with life insurance cover · Pay premiums for a Limited Period while enjoying life cover for entire Policy Term · Tax benefits, as per applicable provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 · Option to receive maturity proceeds in instalments, offering post maturity liquidity and financial flexibility Indian capital markets will continue to prioritise profitability, transparency and strong corporate governance despite a surge in initial public offerings, said Ashish Kumar Chauhan, NSE Chief, during IPO Baatcheet, a special show by Startup Policy Forum (SPF). Chauhan said India’s public markets differ fundamentally from more risk-tolerant markets, with Indian investors, both institutional and retail, placing greater emphasis on sustainable businesses and investor protection. “Broadly speaking, India is about profitability, about transparency and about better corporate governance.” he said. Emphasising the importance of trust in public markets, Chauhan said strong corporate governance remains central to sustaining investor confidence, particularly as retail participation continues to deepen. “Corporate governance is the backbone of this trust. It’s like a pond out of which we all drink… it’s easy to destroy that trust, but very difficult to build,” he said. Addressing founders of listed companies, Chauhan said promoters must recognise the responsibility that comes with managing public capital and consistently prioritise shareholders. “Whenever in doubt, take the decision in favour of the other investors, not yourself. Even if it is legally allowed, don’t do that because morally it may not be correct,” he said, referring to the need to reduce asymmetries of information and power between insiders and public investors. Chauhan cautioned against viewing new-age IPOs as assured wealth creators, noting that long-term outcomes will be determined by post-listing performance over one-, two- and five-year periods. He said public markets carry inherent risks and that returns depend on business fundamentals, governance standards and market cycles. Reflecting on the evolution of India’s capital markets, Chauhan highlighted the growth of retail participation, with over 12 crore unique investors at NSE today, representing nearly 25 per cent of Indian households. He said this reflects increasing trust among households in entrepreneurs and market institutions.

On the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, coriander contracts for April delivery plunged by Rs 56, or 0.50 per cent, to Rs 11,170 per quintal in 12,810 lots.

Sharad Mathur, MD and CEO, Universal Sompo General Insurance “Achieving the goal of ‘Insurance for All by 2047’ will require a clear, time-bound roadmap supported by targeted policy and budgetary measures. The focus should be on building shared digital insurance infrastructure such as interoperable platforms and cost-efficient distribution frameworks that can be used across the industry to expand reach, particularly among first-time buyers. The Budget can also play a catalytic role by allocating sustained funding for insurance awareness and literacy initiatives, especially in rural and low-income regions where adoption remains uneven. In parallel, government insurance and welfare schemes should be structured to enable wider participation from private insurers through more consultative and business-friendly frameworks. Together, these measures will help narrow protection gaps, improve affordability and translate the vision of universal insurance into on-ground outcomes.” Alok Rungta, MD and CEO, Generali Central Life Insurance “The forthcoming Union Budget can bring about compelling reform for the life insurance sector by making long-term financial protection more accessible and relevant for today’s families. To achieve this, the limits on tax concessions for life insurance and retirement products must be revisited, as current thresholds do not reflect rising incomes or evolving life-stage needs. Expanding deductions or making incentives easier to claim will significantly boost demand for higher-value policies, especially given the high protection gap in India. Affordability and participation can be improved by simplifying taxation across life insurance products, encouraging pure protection plans and incentivizing long-term savings. Equally important will be policy continuity and regulatory clarity, enabling insurers to plan responsibly and invest for the future.” Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, writes: “The strong response to the Bharat Coking Coal IPO underscores investor confidence in the company’s monopolistic position in India’s coking coal segment and its long-term demand visibility. The anchor book was fully subscribed at 1x, with 11.88 crore shares allotted, raising ₹273.13 crore, providing early institutional validation to the issue. Exceptional oversubscription in the NII category reflects strong valuation comfort and expectations of listing gains. Robust participation from retail and shareholder segments highlights broad-based investor interest and trust in the Coal India ecosystem. While QIB demand remained relatively measured, the overall subscription trend points to favourable secondary market sentiment, supported by the scarcity value of a pure-play coking coal producer and steady demand from the steel sector.” Executive Centre India Limited has received the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) approval for its proposed initial public offering (IPO).

Rajkumar Subramanian, Head- Products and Family Offices –PL Wealth Management on Silver Outlook, writes: “Silver is emerging as one of the most compelling strategic metals in the current cycle, sitting at the intersection of investment demand and industrial transformation. In India, this dual character is even more pronounced. Beyond its traditional role as a store of value, silver is increasingly driven by structural demand from solar energy, electronics, electric mobility and advanced manufacturing. As India accelerates its renewable and infrastructure ambitions, silver’s industrial relevance strengthens its long-term price support. At the same time, rising retail participation and growing interest from HNI and family capital are positioning silver as a portfolio diversifier alongside gold. However, investors must remain mindful that silver is inherently more volatile than gold, with sharper price swings driven by global growth expectations, dollar movements and speculative flows. It is best approached with disciplined allocation and a medium- to long-term perspective.” Shadowfax's IPO opens January 22 with a price band of ₹118-124, aiming to raise ₹1,907 crore.

Market analysis by Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus.com January 14, 2025 Bitcoin steadied near the mid-$90,000 zone over January 13-14 after a choppy start to the month. BTC prices but tested the $95,000 level today and this is a constructive signal after the recent bout of consolidation. The move suggests buyers are defending higher levels even as macro uncertainty persists. On the downside, the $90,000-$92,000 band continues to act as a key support zone. Sustained acceptance above $95,000 would be required to open the door for a fresh leg higher and any failure to hold this range could invite renewed range trading. Institutional positioning showed early signs of stabilisation. After several sessions of heavy redemptions, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a strong net inflow on January 13 and helped arrest downside momentum. Derivatives markets reflected a more balanced stance as funding rates normalised and liquidation activity remained contained. This indicates a leverage reset rather than forced capitulation. On-chain data also point to a cooling of aggressive profit-taking. Realised profits have moderated sharply from late-2025 peaks. Momentum indicators have reverted toward neutral territory and this is consistent with consolidation above prior breakout levels rather than distribution. Among major altcoins, Ethereum held firm above $3,000. BNB traded largely in the $930-$960 range and found support near recent lows. Solana oscillated between roughly $135 and $150 and reflected continued interest in high-throughput layer-1s even as volatility stayed elevated. XRP hovered around the $2.05-$2.15 band and consolidated after earlier gains. Overall, altcoin performance remained mixed and showed selective strength. Rotation into altcoins continues to be tactical rather than trend-defining, with traders unwilling to commit aggressively ahead of clearer macro and Bitcoin-led direction. Macro cues continue to dominate sentiment. Markets are tracking US inflation data, Federal Reserve guidance, and energy price movements, all of which are influencing global risk appetite and crypto flows. Our advice: Bitcoin’s ability to test $95,000 is a positive structural sign, but this remains a range-bound, event-driven market. Traders should respect the $90,000 support, avoid high leverage, and add exposure only on confirmed spot-led strength. Prioritise BTC and ETH over high-beta altcoins until macro clarity improves and price acceptance above resistance is sustained.

Hurrah? Not quite yet Believe investor focus will now shift to operating profit (PPOP), & there are likely to be PPOP cuts going forward This will be driven by the culmination of multiple factors: modest loan growth, NIM pressure and slower fee income.

Margin pressure from loss of GST input tax credit was largely offset by a favourable product mix shift toward retail protection, improved product-level margins and supportive yield curve movements. Retail protection growth was strong at 40% YoY in 3QFY26, aided by GST removal. ULIP sales picked up, while management also highlighted a pick-up in non-par sales.

Large-scale retail brokers are in a transitionary phase—shifting to one-stop platforms for financial products distribution from pure-play broking-led market proxies. Angel’s aggressive customer acquisition strategy and demonstrated business agility underpin constructive stance. Niche market leadership, customer-centric approach driving high brand recall and lean business structure generating elevated operating efficiencies augur well for Groww. Cross-sell potential is high for both, aided by confluence of rapidly expanding product bouquet and a large and swiftly expanding captive customer base. While market volatility and regulatory headwinds weigh in, nascency of Indian markets and regime change in financial products’ purchase journey position the transformational plays in a sweet spot. Re-rating is contingent on effective business diversification. Our Capital Markets preference: wealth>brokers (large)>AMC>RTA.

Fii: -1678 Dii: +1323 -- Bloomberg - Morgan Stanley increased bonuses by about 20% for bankers in Asia after the firm closed in on a record $10 billion in revenue from the region last year. - Revenue jumped on outsized gains in equity trading, prime brokerage and wealth management, with fees from stock sales and mergers approaching $1 billion. - High-performing managing directors across country banking and booming sectors are expected to receive total compensation including bonuses of $2 million to $2.5 million. Morgan Stanley increased bonuses by about 20% for bankers in Asia after the firm closed in on a record $10 billion in revenue from the region last year, people familiar with the matter said. Revenue jumped on outsized gains in equity trading, prime brokerage and wealth management, the people said. The investment banking and capital markets divisions also regained momentum, with fees from stock sales and mergers approaching $1 billion, the most in years, they added, asking not to be identified because the numbers are confidential. A media representative for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong declined to comment. The Asia record has set traders and bankers up for a robust bonus season. Overall, investment bankers got a 15% to 20% bump for the past year while traders and product specialists in the institutional equity division got more, with top performers seeing increases of at least 30%, the people said. High-performing managing directors across country banking and booming sectors such as technology are expected to receive total compensation including bonuses of $2 million to $2.5 million, the people said. Average compensation of $1 million to $1.5 million represents a sharp contrast to 2024, the people said, after about a fifth of managing directors received no bonuses that year. Morgan Stanley reported $7.64 billion in revenue from Asia in 2024, accounting for about 12% of the New York bank’s global total. That topped arch-rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the third year in a row. Morgan Stanley’s Asia head Gokul Laroia told Bloomberg in a rare interview last year that he was eyeing $10 billion in revenue within five years. Trading momentum in the final quarter helped the firm near its goal much sooner than that. Morgan Stanley’s Asia revenue, which includes Japan and Australia, rose 29% to $7.27 billion for the nine months ended in September. The boon echoed a global revenue surge, with stock traders beating expectations as US President Donald Trump’s policies kept markets on edge. The bank is slated to announce its 2025 earnings on Thursday, joining several Wall Street firms releasing results this week. Despite a record year in Asia, Morgan Stanley cautioned against raising bonuses too sharply, aiming to smooth compensation. Factors such as share-price gains and a large junior workforce tempered growth in the overall bonus pool, another person said. Some 26 bankers and staff in Asia were promoted to managing directors, spanning equity, investment banking and fixed-income divisions, the people said. Dhaval Ajmera, Director – Corporate Affairs, Ajmera Group “The real estate sector has emerged as one of the major contributors to economic growth. In order to keep the momentum rolling and further pick up the pace, we expect the ministry to announce policy reforms and remedial measures in the upcoming budget that will benefit the buyers and developers alike. Most importantly, the sector expects to waive the cap currently placed on home loans and introduce tax benefits on the interest paid by buyers, irrespective of the ticket size. This will, in turn, be a mega-booster for the economy and will have a great run in the Indian real estate ecosystem. Equally significant is the need to truly accelerate India’s transition to Net Zero. In relation to this, we urge the Ministry to introduce an Interest Subvention Scheme - specifically for Green-Rated Real Estate Debt. While developers are keen to build sustainable, IGBC/LEED-certified projects, the sky-high cost of capital remains a major barrier. As a remedial measure, a government-backed subvention of 200-300 basis points on Green Bonds would directly reduce the borrowing costs, making green projects financially viable rather than just aspirational. Last but not least, we look forward to a rationalisation of GST on residential projects and redefine the terminology of affordable housing from price-oriented to measurability, as this will be the last mile help in formalizing the Housing for All dream of the honourable PM.” Ashish Munjal, Co-founder and CEO, SUNSTONE Budget 2026 is an opportunity to transform India’s demographic dividend into a genuinely future ready workforce. To be able to address the growing skills gap, we need to have a major allocation of funds for project-led programs in artificial intelligence, data science, and other emerging technologies, besides investment in multilingual digital learning platforms under Digital India. This means funding not just content, but labs, faculty development, and industry led projects that bring NEP’s vision to life inside classrooms. Affordability, however, remains the biggest barrier for millions of deserving students, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 India. The Central government can ease this by expanding interest free or subsidised education loans on an EMI model, strengthening credit guarantees, and increasing the scholarship corpus for under-served communities. At the same time, tax deductions on individual and corporate spend towards recognised skill certifications will normalise lifelong learning. In the same way that health insurance has become standard, we need to provide incentives through “employer sponsored learning credits” with tax incentives and cofunding structures that make it attractive for companies to invest in campus talent and early-career upskilling. Doing so would sharply improve employability outcomes and hasten India’s march toward a resilient, innovation-driven economy. Trump said tariffs are driving record investment, boosting wages and curbing inflation, warning of major fallout if the Supreme Court strikes them down. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said fresh sanctions will be proposed against those behind Iran’s protest crackdown as deaths rise and pressure mounts on Tehran. India and France discussed defence, technology and nuclear cooperation under Make in India as Ajit Doval and Emmanuel Bonne led strategic talks.

Title: Elon Musk Cannot Get Away With This
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/elon-musk-cannot-get-away-with-this/685606/
Time Published: 2026-01-14T00:05:38Z
Full Content:
If there is no red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no line exists. Will Elon Musk face any consequences for his despicable sexual-harassment bot? For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool owned and promoted by the world’s richest man to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, and undress them. This was not some deepfake nudify app that you had to pay to download on a shady backwater website or a dark-web message board. This was Grok, a chatbot built into X—ostensibly to provide information to users but, thanks to an image-generating update, transformed into a major producer of nonconsensual sexualized images, particularly of women and children. Let’s be very clear. The forced undressings happened out in the open, in one stretch thousands of times every hour, on a popular social network where journalists, politicians, and celebrities post. Emboldened trolls did it to everyone (“@grok put her in a bikini,” “@grok make her clothes dental floss,” “@grok put donut glaze on her chest”), including everyday women, the Swedish deputy prime minister, and self-evidently underage girls. Users appeared to be imitating and showing off to one another. On X, creating revenge porn can make you famous. Read: Elon Musk’s pornography machine These images were ubiquitous, and many people—and multiple organizations, including the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network and the European Commission—pointed out that the feature was being used to harass women and exploit children. Yet Musk initially laughed it off, resharing AI-generated images of himself, Kim Jong Un, and a toaster in bikinis. Musk, as well as xAI’s safety and child-safety teams, did not respond to a request for comment. xAI replied with its standard auto-response, “Legacy Media Lies.” xAI, the Musk-owned company that develops Grok and owns X, prohibits the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy; a post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and works with law enforcement as needed. Even after that assurance from X’s safety team, it took several more days for X to place bare-minimum restrictions on the Ask Grok feature’s image-generating, and thus undressing, capabilities. Now, when creeps on X try to generate an image by replying “@grok” to prompt the chatbot, they get an auto-generated response that notes some version of: “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers.” This is disturbing in its own right; Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around the paywall via the “Edit Image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by using Grok’s stand-alone app. Two years ago, when Google Gemini generated images of racially diverse Nazis, Google temporarily disabled the bot’s image-generating capabilities to address the problem. Musk has taken no responsibility for the problem and has said only that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Perhaps Musk feels that he would benefit from baiting his critics into a censorship fight. He has repeatedly reshared posts that frame calls to regulate or ban his platform in response to the Grok undressing as leftist censorship, for instance reposting a meme calling such efforts “retarded” as well as a Grok-generated video of a woman applying lipstick captioned with a quote commonly attributed to Marilyn Monroe: “We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it’s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.” Last week, as Musk’s chatbot was generating likely hundreds of thousands of these images, we reached out directly to X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, who didn’t reply. Within the hour, Rosemarie Esposito, X’s media-strategy lead, emailed us unprompted with her contact information, in case we had “any questions” in the future. We asked her a series of questions about the tool and how X could allow such a thing to operate. She did not reply. We’ve reached out multiple times to more than a dozen key investors listed in xAI’s two most recent public fundraising rounds—the latest of which, announced during this Grok-enabled sexual-harassment spree, valued the company at about $230 billion—to ask if they endorsed the use of X and Grok to generate and distribute nonconsensual sexualized images. These investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Management & Research Company, the Saudi firm Kingdom Holding Company, and the state-owned investment firms of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. We asked whether they would continue partnering with xAI absent the company changing its products and, if yes, why they felt justified in continuing to invest in a company that has enabled the public sexual harassment of women and exploitation of children on the internet. BlackRock, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and Baron Capital declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley initially told us that she could find no documentation that the company is a major investor in xAI. After we sent a public announcement from xAI that lists Morgan Stanley as a key investor in its Series C fundraising round, the spokesperson did not answer our questions. The other companies did not respond. We also reached out to several companies that provide the infrastructure for X and Grok—in other words, that allow these products to exist on the internet: Google and Apple, which offer both X and Grok on their app stores; Microsoft and Oracle, which run Grok on their cloud services; and Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which sell xAI the computer chips needed to train and run Grok. We asked if they endorsed the use of these products to create nonconsensual sexual images of women and children, and whether they would take steps to prevent this from continuing. None responded except for Microsoft, which told us that it does not provide cloud services, chips, or hosting services for xAI other than offering the Grok language model—without image generation—on its enterprise platform, Microsoft Foundry. The silence says everything. As all of this unfolded, xAI made several major announcements: new Grok products for businesses; upgraded video-generating capabilities; that enormous fundraising round. Yesterday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited SpaceX’s headquarters in Texas and joined Musk for a press conference in which Hegseth said, “I want to thank you, Elon, and your incredible team” for bringing Grok to the military. (Later this year, Grok will join Google Gemini on a new Pentagon platform called GenAI.mil that the Defense Department says will offer advanced AI tools to military and civilian personnel.) We asked the DOD if it endorsed xAI’s sexualized material or if it would reconsider its partnership with the company in response. In a statement, a Pentagon official told us only that the department’s policy on the use of AI “fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations” and that “any unlawful activity” by its personnel “will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.” Read: What are people still doing on X? Government bodies in the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union have said that they will investigate X, while Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok, but Musk appears to be unfazed by these efforts—and also seems to be receiving help in brushing them off. Sarah B. Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, has said that, should the U.K. ban X, America “has a full range of tools that we can use to facilitate uncensored internet access in authoritarian, closed societies.” At the moment, Musk seems to be not only getting away with this but also reveling in it. Although governments appear to be furious at Musk, they also seem impotent. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the TAKE IT DOWN Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last Wednesday that the Grok-generated images “are unacceptable and a clear violation of” the law but that he was “encouraged that X has announced that they’re taking these violations seriously.” Throughout that same day, Grok continued to comply with user requests to undress people. Yesterday, Cruz posted on X a photo of himself with his arm around Musk and the caption “Always great seeing this guy 🚀.” And it’s already beginning to feel as if the scandal—the world’s richest man enabling the widespread harassment of women and children—is waning, crowded out by a new year of relentless news cycles. But this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet. Grok’s ability to undress minors is not, as Musk might have you think, an exercise in free-speech maximalism. It is, however, a speech issue: By turning sexual harassment and revenge porn into a meme with viral distribution, the platform is allowing its worst, most vindictive users to silence and intimidate anyone they desire. The retaliation on X has been obvious—women who’ve stood up in opposition to the tool have been met with anonymous trolls asking Grok to put them in a bikini. Social platforms have long leaned on the argument that they aren’t subject to the same defamation laws as publishers and media companies. But this latest debacle, Musk’s reaction, and the silence from so many of X’s investors and peer companies were all active choices—and symptoms of a broader crisis of impunity that’s begun to seep into American culture. They were the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs bowing to Donald Trump. Of financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors such as cryptocurrency and meme stocks—a braggadocious, “get the bag” ethos that has no room for greed or shame. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences. Few industries have been as brazen in their capitulation as Big Tech, which has dismantled its content-moderation systems to please the current administration. It’s a cynical and cowardly pivot, one that allows companies to continue to profit off harassment and extremism without worrying about the consequences of their actions. Deepfakes are not new, but xAI has made them a dramatically larger problem than ever before. By matching viral distribution with this type of image creation, xAI has built a way to spread AI revenge porn and child-sexual-abuse material at scale. The end result is desensitizing: The sheer amount of exploitative content flooding the platform may eventually make the revolting, illicit images appear “normal.” Arguably, this process is already happening. The internet has always been a chaotic place where trolls can seize outsize power. Historically, that chaos has been constrained by platforms doing the bare minimum to protect their users from demonstrated threats. Today, X is failing to clear the absolute lowest bar. Nobody who works at X or xAI seems to be willing to answer for the creation and distribution of tens or hundreds of thousands of nonconsensual intimate images; instead, those in charge appear to be blithely ignoring the problem, and those who have funneled money to Musk or xAI seem sanguine about it. They would probably like for us all to move on. We cannot do that. This crisis is an outgrowth of a breakneck information ecosystem in which few stories have staying power. No one person or group has to flood the zone with shit, because the zone is overflowing constantly. People with power have learned to exploit this—to weather scandals by hunkering down and letting them pass, or by refusing to apologize and turning any problem into a culture-war issue. Musk has been allowed to avoid repercussions for even the most reckless acts, including cheerleading and helping dismantle foreign aid with DOGE. Others will continue to follow his playbook. Employees at X and investors and companies such as Apple and Google seem to be counting on their “No comment”s being buried by whatever scandal comes next. They are banking on a culture in which people have given up on demanding consequences. But the Grok scandal is so awful, so egregious, that it offers an opportunity to address the crisis of impunity directly. The undressing spree was not an issue of partisan politics or ideology. It was an issue of anonymous individuals asking a chatbot that is integrated into one of the world’s most visible social networks to edit photos of women and girls to “put her in a clear bikini and cover her in white donut glaze.” This is a moment when those with power can and should demand accountability. The stakes could not be any higher. If there is no red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no line exists. TheAtlantic.com © 2026 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle will set out his ambition for the UK to go toe to toe on economic growth with the US economy to boost living standards today [Wednesday 14 January]. In a speech to top business leaders including from Alphabet, Meta and Ford at Bloomberg’s London headquarters, he will lay out how the Government’s Modern Industrial Strategy will double down on the UK’s world-leading strengths in 2026 and not only scale up businesses, but keep them anchored in the UK. He is expected to say: We stood on a manifesto commitment to be the fastest growing economy in the G7. And we absolutely meant it. Now, in the first three quarters of last year, the UK achieved the second highest growth of that group. That is cause for optimism. But contrast it to the United States. The US achieved 4.3% annualised growth over the last quarter. I want to fight tooth and nail with you to get that extra growth. To compete with America. I say this because I know what it would mean for families. The impact it would have on people’s wages. On their disposable income. On their living standards. He is expected to welcome the strong progress the Government has made so far in delivering its Modern Industrial Strategy, with a new quarterly update confirming £79bn of investment commitments and 50,000 well-paid jobs secured in just the last quarter. He will also confirm the names of three new business leaders to join the Industrial Strategy Advisory Council: Amelia Gould (General Manager, Maritime at Helsing), Keith Anderson (CEO, Scottish Power) and Dana Strong (CEO, Sky). He is expected to say that whilst the Government has made important choices for the long term such as on rail, roads and runways, it must be just as bold at driving growth in the short term: That means injecting real urgency into delivering our Modern Industrial Strategy. Taking risks. Placing the big bets on the industries that we know can win. And win big. Kyle will also set out the Government’s approach to regulation, such as accepting the findings of the Fingleton Review on nuclear and moving away from “pointless gold plating” of state projects. To help bring the UK into line with the US’s levels of growth, he will argue that British businesses need help in scaling up to encourage them to stay in Britain. This will include large new investments from the British Business Bank and more firepower for UK Export Finance. He is expected to say: Very soon, I will be setting out how we’ll go even further to reduce that regulatory burden and ensure our most promising start-ups don’t need to leave our shores to reach their full potential. Over the coming days and weeks, we will be doing more – a lot more – to move the dial. To go for growth at every opportunity. He will highlight the Government’s work to reduce burdens for business since his appointment, including a £230 million reduction in admin costs and energy price support such as the Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, slashing businesses’ energy costs. The reception comes ahead of the Business Secretary’s attendance at Davos next week where he will engage with business leaders and set out why the UK is truly the best place in the world to invest, with a culture of entrepreneurship, world-class education and certainty for business. Other attendees at the reception will include the Director Generals of the CBI and BCC, Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy, and executives from Heathrow, Blackrock, McKinsey, BP and AstraZeneca. Keith Anderson has been CEO of ScottishPower since 2018. Prior to his appointment as Chief Executive, Keith was CEO of ScottishPower Renewables and led Iberdrola’s international offshore business. Before joining ScottishPower, Keith worked with some major financial institutions including The Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Life, as well as working as a management consultant with E&Y. Keith has an Honorary Degree from Strathclyde University and is an Honorary Fellow of the Energy Institute. Amelia Gould CEng FIET is the General Manager, Maritime for Helsing and leads the Group’s work in the maritime domain. Amelia has over 20 years of strategic and operational delivery experience in the global defence sector. She began her career as a Royal Navy Engineering Officer where she served for 11 years before moving into enterprise architecture and then joining BAE Systems, where she held senior technical and leadership roles. She became Managing Director of Helsing UK in 2023, helping build Europe’s leading defence tech company, and is now General Manager Maritime. A Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the IET, she is committed to inspiring future talent through her STEM ambassador work and as Chair of Trustees for FirstUK. She was also a Non-Exec director at Maritime UK Solent for 5 years, promoting maritime innovation across the region. Dana Strong is Group Chief Executive of Sky, one of Europe’s leading media and entertainment companies and part of Comcast Corporation, a global media and technology group. Dana has managed both cable and satellite businesses around the world and is recognised for her track record for accelerating growth. Before joining Sky, Dana led transformation and growth for many of the world’s largest media and telecommunication companies serving as President of Consumer Services for Comcast Cable, the largest broadband and PayTV operator in the United States; President and Chief Operating Officer of Virgin Media; and Chief Transformation Officer of Liberty Global.

Title: AI Could Spell Trouble for Software. These Experts Say to Avoid One Stock In Particular

Software was once the hottest industry on Wall Street. Not so in the AI era. S&P 500 software stocks lagged the broader index for the second consecutive year in 2025 as companies making the “picks and shovels” of the AI buildout—like semiconductors and memory devices—led the stock market higher. And analysts expect the challenges weighing on software stocks, especially application developers, to persist in 2026. One example: Oppenheimer on Tuesday downgraded Adobe (ADBE) stock to “Perform” from “Outperform” and withdrew its price target entirely, citing threats from AI that apply to varying degrees across the application software industry. The news pulled Adobe, shares of which have lost more than a fifth of their value over the past 12 months, down more than 5% on Tuesday. Software stocks were expected to have a strong 2025 supported by the deployment of AI agents. The rollout of those agents has moved much slower than expected, weighing on investor sentiment and raising concerns about the software industry's vulnerability to AI disruption. One of the primary issues Adobe faces, according to Oppenheimer, is the perception that AI is weakening its competitive position. Gen AI “is increasing the velocity of content creation while lowering price and subscriber growth,” wrote analysts led by Brian Schwartz. The company faces new competition from LLM providers like OpenAI and advertising platforms like Meta, which have introduced creative tools that allow people other options for doing what previously required an Adobe license and specialized knowledge. Investors also worry that generative AI could upend the seat-based pricing model on which many software-as-a-service providers like Adobe are built. Traditionally, Adobe sells a client a set number of Creative Cloud licenses for a set amount of time, which has meant reliable revenue. It and other software companies will have to adapt if the usage-based pricing—in which a customer pays each time they use a service—favored by AI developers and hyperscalers becomes the norm. Even if seat-based models remain standard, AI threatens to undercut software subscription growth by helping companies to get by with smaller teams and lowering the cost of switching vendors, according to a recent Deutsche Bank note. AI isn’t seen as a threat to all software companies. Infrastructure software stocks performed well last year as companies accelerated IT modernization and cloud migration efforts as they sought to transition to more AI usage, according to Deutsche Bank. Shares of data analytics software provider Palantir (PLTR) more than doubled in value last year as its commercial sales soared. Cloud migrations also helped support shares of companies like MongoDB (MDB) and Snowflake (SNOW). Morgan Stanley analysts expect many of the trends that fueled last year's infrastructure software rally to carry into 2026. They argue the rollout of AI copilots and agents should support demand for data management and observability tools, as should robust cloud growth. Cloud and AI spending are expected to remain top priorities for companies this year. Cloud spending growth is expected to hold steady at 10%, according to a Jefferies survey of IT executives and chief investment officers. That survey also found that, on average, nearly 12% of IT budgets will be dedicated to AI this year, up from 6.5% last year. Adobe's stock is down more than 50% since peaking in 2021. About half of the analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rate Adobe stock a “Buy,” while two are neutral and three recommend selling. The average price target near $392 represents 26% upside from Tuesday’s close.

Software was once the hottest industry on Wall Street. Not so in the AI era. S&P 500 software stocks lagged the broader index for the second consecutive year in 2025 as companies making the “picks and shovels” of the AI buildout—like semiconductors and memory devices—led the stock market higher. And analysts expect the challenges weighing on software stocks, especially application developers, to persist in 2026. One example: Oppenheimer on Tuesday downgraded Adobe (ADBE) stock to “Perform” from “Outperform” and withdrew its price target entirely, citing threats from AI that apply to varying degrees across the application software industry. The news pulled Adobe, shares of which have lost more than a fifth of their value over the past 12 months, down more than 5% on Tuesday. Software stocks were expected to have a strong 2025 supported by the deployment of AI agents. The rollout of those agents has moved much slower than expected, weighing on investor sentiment and raising concerns about the software industry's vulnerability to AI disruption. One of the primary issues Adobe faces, according to Oppenheimer, is the perception that AI is weakening its competitive position. Gen AI “is increasing the velocity of content creation while lowering price and subscriber growth,” wrote analysts led by Brian Schwartz. The company faces new competition from LLM providers like OpenAI and advertising platforms like Meta, which have introduced creative tools that allow people other options for doing what previously required an Adobe license and specialized knowledge. Investors also worry that generative AI could upend the seat-based pricing model on which many software-as-a-service providers like Adobe are built.

Title: Ethereum stuck between staking strength and derivatives risk – What’s next?

Time Published: 2026-01-13T22:00:58Z

Ethereum’s bid–ask imbalance signals “caution.” Risk assets are stuck in a tug-of-war between supply and demand. Consequently, breaking out of the ongoing market chop requires spotting a bid–ask imbalance. According to AMBCrypto, how top caps navigate this imbalance will likely determine their next directional move. For Ethereum [ETH], early signs are already showing, putting the usual “buy the fear vs. sell the strength” question back into focus. Notably, BitMine seems to have picked a side, staking another $340 million in ETH. Source: ValidatorQueue And it doesn’t stop there: BMNR now has $3.69 billion in total staked ETH. Meanwhile, about 2.16 million ETH are waiting to be staked over the following days, potentially bringing total staked Ethereum to nearly 37.8 million, an all-time high for this period, assuming the exit queue remains at zero. In short, Ethereum’s chop around $3k looks like a textbook breakout scenario, with bids dominating the action. In this context, could ETH be setting up a bear trap, catching the short side off-guard? Liquidity in derivatives is thickening as the market navigates uncertainty. CoinGlass data shows nearly $2.95 billion in short clusters at near-term risk if ETH moves another 11%. Meanwhile, Binance’s 4H perpetual contract is about 70% long, suggesting late-long positions are starting to catch up. Given Ethereum’s solid technicals and staking flows, this positioning makes sense. That said, calling it a full-blown supply squeeze might be a stretch, as around 160k ETH have moved into reserves just this past week. Source: CryptoQuant Moreover, another BlackRock deposit has hit the network. Against this backdrop, analysts note ETH’s Open Interest (OI) is rebounding to early-October levels. A rising OI generally implies more traders are opening positions, setting the stage for sharper moves in either direction. That’s where Ethereum’s bid–ask imbalance comes in. Staking is tightening supply, but sellers haven’t stepped away yet. In short, long exposure is building faster than demand, leaving the bid fragile. Hence, ETH’s chop remains exposed to a bull trap rather than a breakout. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Here’s how the US government now offers a path to a new all-time high for Bitcoin and crypto CLARITY

The CLARITY Act introduces a regulatory framework to harmonize SEC and CFTC oversight, redefining asset classification and safeguarding investor interests. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On Jan. 13, the US Senate Banking Committee released the full text of the highly anticipated Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY) ahead of its expected markup this week. The 278-page draft abandons the strategy of picking winners on a token-by-token basis. Instead, it constructs a comprehensive “lane system” that assigns jurisdiction based on the functional lifecycle of a digital asset. Speaking on the legislation, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott said: “[This legislation] gives everyday Americans the protections and certainty they deserve. Investors and innovators can’t wait forever while Washington stands still, and bad actors exploit the system. This legislation puts Main Street first, cracks down on criminals and foreign adversaries, and keeps the future of finance here in the United States.” The proposal arrives at a pivotal moment for the industry. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, described the legislation as the “Punxsutawney Phil of this crypto winter,” noting that if the bill passes and is signed into law, the market could be “heading to new all-time highs.” Notably, crypto bettors on prediction markets appear optimistic, with Polymarket users currently assigning the CLARITY Act an 80% chance of being signed into law this year. However, the clock is ticking, as Senators have a tight 48-hour window to propose amendments to the text. The core of the draft creates a legislative bridge between the two primary US market regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Joint effort by SEC and CFTC signals end of policy uncertainty, aligning with U.S. crypto innovation goals. The Clarity Act revives and codifies a policy distinction often debated in legal circles: that tokens sold with a promoter’s promise may begin their life looking like securities but can evolve into commodity-like network assets as control disperses. To operationalize this, the bill defines an “ancillary asset.” This category covers network tokens whose value relies on the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts” of an originator or a “related person.” The legislation directs the SEC to specify exactly how to apply those concepts through rulemaking, effectively giving the agency the front-end oversight of crypto projects. Once a token falls into this lane, the draft leans heavily into an SEC-led disclosure regime that mirrors public equity standards. The required disclosure list is extensive and intentionally “public-company-ish.” It mandates that issuers provide financial statements that must be reviewed or audited, depending on the size of the raise. It also requires ownership details, records of related-party transactions, token distributions, code audits, and tokenomics. Additionally, issuers must provide market data such as average prices and highs/lows. However, the bill provides a clear handoff by repeatedly anchoring the definition of a “digital commodity” to the Commodity Exchange Act. It treats the CFTC as the relevant counterpart regulator for the market plumbing, requiring the SEC to notify its sister agency of certain certifications. Put simply, the SEC regulates the “promoter” questions (disclosure, anti-fraud, and fundraising). On the other hand, the CFTC oversees trading venues and intermediaries that handle the assets once they are traded as commodities. This framework also imposes strict investor protection rules on intermediaries themselves. The draft states that Regulation Best Interest applies to broker-dealer recommendations involving digital commodities and that investment advisers’ fiduciary duty extends to advice on these assets. This ensures that even if Bitcoin and Ethereum are commodities, the brokers selling them to retail investors do not get a regulatory free pass regarding suitability and conflicts of interest. For market participants holding major assets, the most immediate impact comes from a specific carve-out tied to exchange-traded products (ETPs). The text states that a network token is not an ancillary asset if its unit has been the principal asset of an exchange-traded product listed on a registered national securities exchange as of January 1, 2026. This provision serves as a functional on-ramp to commodity status, bypassing years of litigation and SEC debate over decentralization. In practice, this “ETF gatekeeping” clause captures Bitcoin and Ethereum, given their established footprint. This means that digital assets like XRP, Solana, Litecoin, Hedera, Dogecoin, and Chainlink that have achieved this status would be treated the same as BTC and ETH. Beyond asset classification, the draft offers significant relief for the Ethereum ecosystem regarding staking. The draft addresses the lingering fear that staking rewards could be classified as securities income by defining them as “gratuitous distributions.” The bill explicitly includes multiple staking pathways in this definition, covering self-staking, self-custodial staking with a third party, and even liquid staking structures. This is particularly noteworthy, given that the SEC previously filed legal actions against firms like Kraken for their staking activity. The firm will pay a large penalty and face a permanent injunction. Crucially, the text establishes a presumption that a gratuitous distribution is not, by itself, an offer or sale of a security. The language regarding “self-custodial with a third party” is precise, noting that it applies where the third-party operator does not maintain custody or control of the staked token. This creates a tailored safe lane for non-custodial and liquid staking designs, though it leaves custodial exchange staking open to continued regulatory scrutiny. The legislation also incorporates the “stablecoin rewards fight” directly into the market-structure package. They earn $176B on Fed reserves and $187B in swipe fees, and now they’re lobbying to shut the rewards door. Section 404 of the Clarity Act appears to hand the banking sector a victory regarding yield-bearing instruments. The latest text prohibits companies from paying interest or yield solely for holding a payment stablecoin. However, legal experts note a critical distinction in how the bill constructs the yield economy. Bill Hughes, a lawyer at Consensys, noted that CLARITY deliberately allows stablecoins to be used to earn yield, but it draws a bright legal line between “the stablecoin” and “the yield product.” The bill adopts the definition of a “payment stablecoin” from the GENIUS Act, requiring such coins to be fully backed, redeemable at par, and used for settlement, without giving holders any entitlement to interest or profits from the issuer. This ensures that a token like USDC cannot pay yield just for holding it, which would classify it as an illegal security or shadow banking product. Yet, Title IV includes a section on “preserving rewards for stablecoin holders.” This allows users to earn yield by utilizing stablecoins in other systems, such as DeFi lending protocols, on-chain money markets, or custodial interest accounts. PayPal's PYUSD trading volume spikes following its integration with major Solana DeFi protocols. Under this framework, the stablecoin remains a payment instrument, while the “wrapper” or the yield-generating product becomes the regulated financial entity (whether as a security, commodity pool, or banking product). This architecture effectively prevents regulators from classifying a stablecoin as a security simply because it can be used to earn interest. Thus, it preserves the viability of the DeFi yield economy atop “boring” payment tokens. The new draft also addresses the contentious issue of decentralized finance (DeFi) interfaces. Hughes pointed out that the bill moves away from a simplistic “wallets vs. websites” debate and instead establishes a “control test” to determine regulatory obligations. According to the text, a web interface is legally treated as mere software (and thus not subject to broker-dealer registration) if it does not hold user funds, control private keys, or have the authority to block or reorder transactions. This creates a statutory safe harbor for non-custodial platforms like Uniswap, 1inch, and MetaMask’s swap UI. It classifies them as software publishers rather than financial intermediaries. Conversely, the bill strictly regulates any operator that possesses control. If a website can move funds without a user signature, batch trades, or route orders through proprietary liquidity, it is classified as a broker or exchange. This captures centralized entities like Coinbase and Binance, as well as custodial bridges and CeFi yield platforms. The proposed Senate bill seeks to impose KYC on DeFi, sparking fears of an exodus to offshore liquidity platforms. Despite the optimism from some quarters, the bill’s release has triggered a “mad scramble” among legal experts to identify critical flaws before the 48-hour amendment window closes. Jake Chervinsky, the Chief Legal Officer at Variant Fund, pointed out that lobbyists and policy experts are racing to address what he described as “many” critical issues before the markup deadline. According to him: “A lot has changed since the draft that came out in September, and the devil is in the details. Amendments are due by 5 pm ET, so it's a mad scramble today identifying critical issues to fix in markup. Sadly there are many.” Meanwhile, some critics also argue that the bill introduces existential threats to privacy and decentralization. Aaron Day, an independent Senate candidate, described the mandatory trade surveillance requirements as taking a page from the “NSA playbook.” Day highlighted provisions for “universal registration” that would require exchanges, brokers, and even “associated persons” to register, effectively burying the concept of anonymous participation. He also pointed to mandates for “government custodians,” arguing that self-custody for regulated activity effectively becomes illegal. He said: “BlackRock and Wall Street get clear on-ramps while DeFi gets strangled in the crib. The SEC and CFTC get expanded empires and fresh revenue streams. You get watched. Tracked. Controlled.” Beyond privacy concerns, reports indicate the industry faces two specific policy hurdles in the latest draft. Crypto journalist Sander Lutz reported that the language around stablecoin yield has left both banks and crypto advocates dissatisfied. While banks appear to have secured a ban on interest for holding stablecoins, loopholes regarding “activity rewards” and loyalty programs remain murky. Lutz also noted that the Senate Banking Committee's addition of an “unexpected section on DeFi caught industry lobbyists off guard. According to him, the section's new definitions could rope decentralized protocols into strict regulatory frameworks. CLARITY Act vote ahead As the Senate Banking Committee moves toward the Clarity Act markup, the political landscape remains fluid. While the bill cleared the House last year, the inclusion of banking-sector priorities, such as restrictions on self-hosted wallets or prohibitions on CBDCs, remains a point of interest for negotiators. With the Senate substitute text now effectively resetting the terms of engagement, the industry is watching to see if this bill will finally signal an early spring for US crypto regulation. However, Lutz noted that the current frictions have led to a darkening outlook among some insiders. He reported that an unnamed industry source described the bill's current chances as “NGMI” (not gonna make it). According to him, the source cited not only structural disagreements but also enduring conflicts between Senate Democrats and the White House regarding ethics and conflict-of-interest language.

Title: Gold tops $4.6K as crypto enters macro week: Coincidence or early warning?

Rates spike, liquidity shifts: Is crypto at risk? The crypto market is heading into another macro-heavy week. This time, however, the main headwind is “rate cuts.” From the recent fallout between President Trump and Fed Chair Powell to tariff-related FUD and the upcoming CPI report, all roads lead back to rate expectations. The logic is simple: as Q1 unfolds, traders are pricing in rate cuts as a bullish catalyst for crypto, and with roughly $200 billion in inflows over the past two weeks, liquidity is stacking up for a potential risk-on rotation. Source: X However, smart money clearly splits on the outlook. On one side, $1.2 trillion BlackRock is calling for a 3% Fed rate cut. On the flip side, JPMorgan, the world’s largest bank, is hawkish, projecting no rate cuts “this year,” with other big players like Barclays backing that view. In fact, even Willy Woo has flagged a bearish outlook for crypto in 2026. Naturally, with volatility ramping up, Bitcoin [BTC] faces a test of its “safe-haven” status. The big question: Have traders already priced in this setup? Traditional assets are back in the spotlight, hitting fresh highs. Gold (XAU), for instance, topped $4,630 on the 12th of January, syncing with the growing macro FUD around crypto. According to AMBCrypto, the big question is, is this just a “coincidence” or an early warning for risk assets? Looking at 2025, this rotation doesn’t feel random. Gold closed the year with a 65% ROI, while BTC lagged at -6%. The result? The Bitcoin/Gold ratio has slipped to 20, meaning it now takes 20 ounces of gold to match one Bitcoin, down from 35 ounces at the start of the year. Source: LongTermTrends In essence, crypto FUD gave gold a boost in the 2025 cycle. Notably, the same pattern is playing out now. Gold and Silver are breaking into all-time highs “together.” Looking back at 2025, this kind of rotational move always lined up with stress building under the U.S. economy. Now, that’s where rate cuts come into play. With recent macro FUD flipping the market hawkish, the odds of a cut sit at just 5%. In this climate, the upcoming macro week is primed to put crypto under pressure, with Gold’s breakout acting as an “early” warning sign.

Title: Trump set to lead largest-ever US delegation to World Economic Forum in Davos next week

GENEVA (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump will return to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting of business, political and cultural elites in Davos, Switzerland, next week, leading a record-large U.S. delegation, organizers said Tuesday. The Geneva-based think tank says Trump, whose assertive foreign policy on issues as diverse as Venezuela and Greenland in recent months has stirred concerns among U.S. friends and foes alike, will be accompanied by five Cabinet secretaries and other top officials for the event running from Monday through Jan. 23. A total of 850 CEOs and chairs of the world’s top companies will be among the 3,000 participants from 130 countries expected in the Alpine resort this year, the forum says. Forum President Borge Brende says six of the Group of Seven leaders — including Trump — will attend, as well as presidents Volodymyr Zelenskky of Ukraine, Ahmad al-Sharaa of Syria and others. A total of 64 heads of state or government are expected so far — also a record — though that number could increase before the start of the event, he said. China’s delegation will be headed by Vice Premier He Lifeng, Beijing’s top trade official, Brende said. Among the scores of other high-profile attendees expected are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as well as tech industry titans Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Brende said the U.S. delegation will include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, along with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff. The forum, which held its first annual meeting in 1971, has long been a hub of dialogue, debate and deal-making. Trump has already attended twice while president, and was beamed in by video last year just days after being inaugurated for his second term. Critics call it a venue for the world’s elites to hobnob and do business that sometimes comes at the expense of workers, the impoverished or people on the margins of society. The forum counters that its stated goal is “improving the state of the world” and insists many advocacy groups, academics and cultural leaders have an important role too. This year’s edition will be the first annual meeting not headed by forum founder Klaus Schwab, who resigned last year. He’s been succeeded by interim co-chairs Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of New York-based investment management company BlackRock, and Andre Hoffmann, the vice chairman of Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche Holdings.

Title: Meta is changing its performance review to reward output over effort, taking a page from Amazon and X

Meta Platforms Inc. just became the latest tech company to rejig its performance review process to hone in on an employee’s output, as opposed to effort. The company is rolling out a new performance review platform called Checkpoint, which will grade workers, grouping them into four categories and rewarding top performers for exceptional work, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider. “We’re evolving our performance program to simplify it and placing greater emphasis on rewarding outstanding performance,” a Meta spokesperson told Fortune. “While our employees have always been held to a high-performance, impact-based culture, this new direction allows for more frequent feedback and recognition in a more efficient way.” The memo outlined the predicted distribution of outcomes and pay multipliers for base bonuses. About 20% of employees will be labeled “Outstanding” and will be eligible for a bonus double their pay; 70% will be labeled “Excellent” with a 115% pay bonus; around 7% will fall into the “Needs Improvement” category, eligible for a bonus up to 50% of pay. Around 3% of employees may be labeled “Not Meeting Expectations” and will be ineligible for a bonus. On the other hand, the system will reward top performers with bonuses worth up to 300%. The performance review update comes as other Big Tech companies have overhauled their performance review systems to better reflect employee performance. Amazon’s new review system asks corporate workers to list three to five accomplishments that reflect their best work. And in 2022, Elon Musk asked X (formerly Twitter) employees to explain what they accomplished every week. Meta is planning a company-wide meeting Jan. 22 to further explain the changes to employees. The new changes will impact the 2026 performance cycle and will not change the current review cycle. The new system will entail two review cycles per year, using the same rating system each cycle. As part of this new review timeline, bonuses will be paid out twice annually. Tech companies have increasingly sought concrete examples of output as proof of productivity, requiring that employees demonstrate how well they perform. While outcomes have been a longstanding cornerstone of corporate performance reviews, the new push toward output-based assessments reflects a growing desire among tech leaders to incentivize employees to prove outstanding performance. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has pushed to reduce management layers and to eliminate bureaucracy since taking over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in 2022 that he was aiming to make the company more lean to promote “product excellence and productivity.” That has been the trend at Meta, where the tech company called 2023 the “year of efficiency” as the company scaled back headcount. In 2022, the company laid off about 13% of its workforce, or 11,000 employees. And last year, the company cut 5% of its workforce, or roughly 3,000 workers, targeting low performers. To be sure, an update to Meta’s performance review system is not a warning sign that additional layoffs are on their way. But Meta is set to announce layoffs this week in the company’s Reality Labs business, according to reporting by The New York Times, as the company scales back its metaverse unit. “We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said ahead of last year’s cuts. “But now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.”

Title: This Analyst Says Advanced Micro Devices Will Soar 30% in 2026. Here’s Why It’s Time to Buy.

Investing Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock surged 78% in 2025. KeyBanc upgraded AMD to Overweight with a $270 price target citing 30% upside. AMD’s server CPUs are nearly sold out for 2026. Average selling prices may increase 10% to 15% in Q1. Analyst forecasts AMD AI revenue will reach $14B to $15B in 2026 driven by MI355 and MI455 accelerator shipments. Sending You to Google News in 3 © HelloRF Zcool / Shutterstock.com Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock climbed 78% in 2025, driven by growing adoption of its artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators and expectations for next-generation products. The company’s Instinct MI300 series gained market share in data centers, competing against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). At CES 2026 earlier this month, AMD showcased advancements like the Helios AI platform and previews of future chips, signaling it was continuing to innovate and not rest on its laurels. This morning, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upgraded AMD to Overweight with a $270 per share price target, implying 30% upside from yesterday’s closing price, citing sold-out server CPUs and strong hyperscaler demand. He forecasts at least 50% growth in AMD’s server CPU business and $14 billion to $15 billion in AI revenue for 2026. With these drivers pushing it forward, AMD has significant tailwinds that may propel shares beyond a mere 30% gain. KeyBanc’s note followed an Asia supply-chain trip revealing robust demand for AMD’s AI and data-center products. The firm noted AMD’s server CPUs are nearly sold out for 2026, prompting a potential 10% to 15% increase in average selling prices in the first quarter. This tightness stems from hyperscalers ramping up AI infrastructure investments, who are projected to spend over $600 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in 2026, a 36% increase from 2025, primarily on AI infrastructure. The analyst expects AMD’s server CPU revenue to grow at least 50% year-over-year in 2026, fueled by the EPYC line’s adoption. In Q3, AMD’s fifth-generation Epyc Turin CPUs accounted for over half of all Epyc-related revenue. Similarly, AI-related revenue is forecast to hit $14 billion to $15 billion this year, boosted by shipments of the MI355 accelerator and a major ramp in the MI455-powered Helios platform. Earnings estimates were raised to $4.01 per share for 2025 and $7.93 for 2026, up from prior forecasts. AMD’s valuation justifies the $270 target price, based on 34 times the 2026 earnings estimate. AMD trades at 32 times consensus 2026 earnings, compared to peers at 27 times, reflecting its growth premium. The note also highlights tight memory supply pressuring PCs but benefiting AMD’s margins through a data center shift, aligning with the upgrade the analyst gave for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and indicating overall semiconductor strength. At CES 2026, AMD unveiled the Helios rack-scale platform, integrating 72 Instinct MI455X accelerators, EPYC Venice CPUs on 2 nanometer (nm) Zen 6 architecture, and Pensando Vulcan NICs. This setup delivers up to 3 AI exaflops per rack, targeting trillion-parameter AI model training with high bandwidth and efficiency. Helios matches Nvidia’s NVL72 in scale but emphasizes memory richness and cost-effectiveness through the open source ROCm software stack. The company also previewed the Instinct MI500 series for 2027, built on CDNA 6 architecture with 2nm process and HBM4E memory. It promises up to 1,000 times the AI performance of the MI300X through architectural enhancements, FP4 formats, faster interconnects, and improved memory. These announcements position AMD to challenge Nvidia in AI inference and enterprise deployments, appealing to buyers seeking open standards over proprietary systems. The MI500 series’ projected performance leap addresses escalating AI demands, with global compute capacity expected to reach 10 yottaflops in five years. A yottaflop is one septillion — a 1 followed by 24 zeros — floating-point operations per second. Zen 6 CPUs on 2nm enhance efficiency, supporting data-center expansions. Roadmaps show AMD launching Zen 6 this year and Medusa APUs in 2027, bolstering the PC and embedded markets. Partnerships with OpenAI, Luma AI, and others underscore its ecosystem’s growth. These developments narrow the gap with Nvidia’s 92% market share, potentially capturing more in cost-sensitive segments. AMD’s focus on scalable, efficient AI positions it for gains for years to come as infrastructure spending expands. Analysts maintain a Moderate Buy consensus on AMD, with a consensus price target of $277 per share — higher than even KeyBanc’s target and implying 33% upside. After AMD’s November earnings report, firms like Melius Research, Raymond James, Wells Fargo, and multiple others set targets at $300 or much higher. With strong product demand and next-gen developments like MI500 on the horizon, price targets below $300 will appear quaint in three to five years, meaning you should be buying AMD stock now.

Pirates, Plunderers & Predators… The US criminal terrorist organization and its banks, mega-corporations, and secret drug enforcement units are now openly stealing property and presidents and running terror-style operations while the social propagandists roll out fake videos of people who ‘own nothing but are happy’. I am Jeff Berwick and this is my 3D Game Video. In this video game, I’ve been dodging weaponized Cat 5 hurricanes and giant earthquake boulders to get the truth out there about an insane, deranged psychopath system that is trying to kill and enslave everyone on earth. For my trouble, I got a WARNING that said “You’ve offended Mossad”. As I talk about the past week’s clown show, Banana republic, cheap ass propaganda and lies, I’m battling “truth” salesmen Alex Jones, Tim Pool, Nick Fuentes who are full-on shilling for the Slave System and its government bodies and elite institutions. In this game, I’m tracking the Venezuela takeover – ruthless, bloodless and not in the least suspicious. BlackRock gets bitcoin. JP Morgan gets silver. Benjamin Mileikowsky gets to hand-pick a new anti-Iran, pro-Israhell regime. And, Trump gets Mar-A-Venezuela. Next up: Colombia and Cuba (both of which have some pretty great riviera estate for Trump Towers and golf courses). And, Greenland. Because national defense and so on, you know. Of course, if you were really going to round up the world’s worst dictators and druglords, the Clintons, the Bushes, the Obamas, the Bidens and Trumps would all be on death row, along with Anthony Fraudci, Kill Gates, Albert Bourla and the rest. In my video game, Berwick.exe (status Stateless Dog Walker) has only one curse, given by the Oracle of Early Sight: “You will see the trap before it springs, but most won’t believe your crazy tales before it’s too late.” Am I crazy? Or do I know these things because I’m not registered in the System and I can see through the Mirror projection? I swore no oath and wear no crown. I carry no sword… but a pouch full of silver coins… And a bag of ITOADASO’s.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin (BTC) and the stock market have experienced sharp price swings and declines since 2025. Because of this volatility, a crypto analyst has warned that the market correction could intensify further in 2026. In a detailed analysis, he outlines a bearish scenario for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could soon face another price crash amid persistent downward pressure in the broader stock market. Market analyst Doctor Profit has raised concerns about the direction of the crypto and traditional markets, warning that both Bitcoin and stocks are currently in a severe bear market. In a technical breakdown on X this Monday, the expert highlighted three major bearish setups forming simultaneously in Bitcoin. He highlighted a massive Bearish Divergence on the weekly and monthly charts, a clear bearish flag signaling a potential drop toward $70,000, and a possible Head and Shoulder pattern that could still play out. While he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still experience short-term price increases and briefly rise toward the $97,000-$107,000 range due to strong liquidity, he said that the ultimate target remains $70,000. Doctor Profit emphasized that Bitcoin’s potential decline to $70,000 could go two ways. It could either break out of the bearish flag to that downside target or complete the Head and Shoulders pattern before reaching $70,000. He stated that he will not add new short positions at current prices but plans to increase them aggressively from $115,000 to $125,000 if Bitcoin moves into the $97,000 to $107,000 range. The analyst painted a similarly grim picture for the stock market. He said he was “ultra-bearish” on both Bitcoin and the financial system. He also noted that the banks are stressed and that forced liquidations in precious metals like Silver are creating ripples across the broader market. Additionally, Doctor Profit noted that insider activity shows clear signs of panic among investors, with record levels of selling since August 2025. Because of this, the analyst believes that the market is heading for a 2008-style crash. Consequently, he has concluded that the current market conditions are too extreme. On the bright side, Doctor Profit said that although he maintains short positions on stocks and Bitcoin, he remains bullish on Gold and Silver. He explained that any upside to the $97,000-$107,000 range will prompt him to increase his short exposure and roll spot profits for BTC from $85,000 into these positions. Toward the end of his analysis, Doctor Profit discussed upcoming events that could influence Bitcoin and the broader financial markets this week. He stated that the US CPI inflation forecast of 2.7% will be released this Tuesday. Other than this, the rest of the week is expected to have few market-moving events. Doctor Profit has also highlighted January 15 as an important date because US lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act. He explained that if the bill passes, it will move closer to becoming law, setting clear rules and oversight for the crypto market.

Title: Trump criminal probe of Fed Chair Powell marks unprecedented escalation — and a warning to his successor

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank had been served by the Justice Department in connection with allegations related to congressional testimony on the renovation of the bank’s headquarters. (Credit: Federal Reserve) President Donald Trump's criminal probe targeting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell marks an extraordinary escalation in his battle with the central bank, sending a clear warning to the next Fed chair about the risks of defying the White House. Powell confirmed the Department of Justice investigation on Sunday evening in a video statement, calling the move "unprecedented" and another example of what he described as the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to intimidate the central bank. Powell's decision to respond so publicly, after days of private consultation with advisers, marked a sharp departure from the central banker's typically measured approach. TRUMP VS THE FEDERAL RESERVE: HOW THE CLASH REACHED UNCHARTED TERRITORY U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the Trump administration's criminal investigation in a video statement. (Al Drago/AFP/Getty Images) The probe focuses on whether Powell was truthful during congressional testimony about the project to overhaul the Fed's two main buildings on the National Mall. No charges have been filed, and Powell has denied any wrongdoing. The White House referred questions to the Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said Monday that her office proceeded with the probe after failing to receive a response from Powell, prompting prosecutors to initiate a legal process. "The United States Attorney’s Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman’s congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat," Pirro stated. "The word "indictment" has come out of Mr. Powell’s mouth, no one else’s. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach." Powell, widely viewed as one of the most crisis-tested Federal Reserve chairs in modern U.S. history, built his career as a lawyer and investment banker in New York before entering public service in the administration of President George H.W. Bush. He joined the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors in 2012 and was tapped to lead the central bank in 2017. Now, a criminal investigation may represent the biggest test of Powell’s leadership, unfolding as Trump weighs his choice for the next Fed chair with Powell’s term set to expire in May. President Donald Trump visited the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, D.C., to tour the ongoing renovation. (Official White House photo by Daniel Torok) The next Fed chair would take on one of the most powerful economic jobs in the country, helping decide how expensive it is to borrow money for things like homes, cars and credit cards. Those decisions directly affect the cost of everyday living for Americans. FROM MORTGAGES TO CAR LOANS: HOW AFFORDABILITY RISES AND FALLS WITH THE FED Trump has narrowed his shortlist to four candidates as he approaches a final decision on leadership at the Fed: Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller and Rick Rieder. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has been a loyal supporter of Trump's economic agenda. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Kevin Hassett is Trump’s top economic advisor and a loyal defender of the administration’s policies. He currently serves as director of the White House’s National Economic Council, and held two senior roles during Trump’s first term and advised the president on economic policy during the 2024 campaign. POWELL REVEALS WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO STEP DOWN FROM THE FED AS PRESSURE MOUNTS Meanwhile, Kevin Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley banker, has emerged as a vocal critic of current Fed leadership, sharpening his attacks as he positioned himself as a potential replacement for Powell. He became the youngest person to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2006. Kevin Warsh, former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve, was long considered for Treasury Secretary before Trump ultimately tapped Scott Bessent. (Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller has repeatedly called for rate cuts, a move that aligns, in part, with Trump's demands. Of the candidates, he is considered the veteran academic of the group. He has also reiterated the importance of maintaining an independent Federal Reserve. And BlackRock Global Fixed Income Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder is the last candidate to have an interview with Trump before the president makes his decision. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who did pre-interviews with all the candidates, said Trump is expected to announce his decision by the end of January. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill said they would block the confirmation of Trump's Federal Reserve nominee until the legal matter is resolved. As the investigation unfolds and a decision on the next Fed chair approaches, the episode underscores the growing political pressure surrounding a role long viewed as insulated from the White House.

Title: Meta Reportedly Laying Off More Than 10% Of Reality Labs
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reportedly-laying-off-over-10-of-reality-labs/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T16:06:21Z
Full Content:
Meta is laying off around 10% of its Reality Labs division, specifically targeting VR and Horizon Worlds, The New York Times reports. Reality Labs, if you're unaware, is the division of Meta behind its Quest headsets, Horizon software, smart glasses, and sEMG wristband, as well as researching future technologies such as Codec Avatars and true AR glasses. The New York Times estimates Reality Labs at roughly 15,000 staff, suggesting that more than 1500 could be losing their job. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has scheduled an all-hands meeting for tomorrow, both the NYT and Business Insider claim, describing it as the “most important” of the year. The report comes just over a month after Meta officially confirmed "shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables", a statement which itself followed early reports of the cuts from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Insider. "Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables given the momentum there," last month's statement read. "We aren't planning any broader changes than that." With the layoffs reportedly taking place this week, we'll bring you updates as we learn of Meta staff affected. Meta's funding shift from Horizon Worlds and VR to smart glasses is happening just over a year after a leaked memo from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staff that 2025 will determine whether their projects are "the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure". In the memo, Bosworth described 2025 as "the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs", and told staff they "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR". Note that at the time, Meta was using MR to refer to VR too, a nomenclature that it ended earlier this year. "And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance", Bosworth followed that sentence with. Since then, Reality Labs saw its highest-ever quarterly revenue in Q4 2024 with the launch of Quest 3S, which was the top-selling console on Amazon US for Christmas. But this momentum did not carry through into 2025 at all. The first two quarters of 2025 saw Quest sales decline year-over-year, revealing that while Quest 3S was a popular stocking stuffer, it simply is not a successful year-round product. While Q3 saw a rebound, Meta explained that this was due to retailers stocking up on Quest 3S for this year's holiday season. Meanwhile, Meta has continued to push its Horizon Worlds "metaverse" platform with multi-million-dollar creator competitions, especially focused on smartphone-only worlds, as the company hopes to scale the platform from a social VR space to a cross-platform Roblox and Fortnite competitor. This relative stagnation in Meta's Quest and Horizon Worlds effort is contrasted with skyrocketing sales and significant public and investor interest in its smart glasses. In multiple earnings calls last year, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica said that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses were performing "exceptionally well", with sales having more than tripled compared to 2024. Both companies have claimed to be selling many models as fast as they can make them. Meta has also claimed "unprecedented demand" for its higher-end Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, recently announcing a delay of its international expansion plans to catch up with US production. UPDATE: UploadVR can confirm that the layoffs include the closure of Twisted Pixel Games (Deadpool VR), Sanzaru Games (Asgard's Wrath), and Armature Studio (Resident Evil 4 VR). UPDATE 2: Meta announced that its VR/MR fitness service Supernatural will no longer receive any "new content or feature updates". Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

No demo or credit card required. Start a free trial immediately and get top legal AI at your fingertips. What problem does your product solve? Most solo and small-firm attorneys are relying on generic LLMs (like ChatGPT) outside of their working environment (e.g., Microsoft Word), because the most advanced legal AI is largely being built for large teams, such as Am Law 100 firms and S&P 500 legal departments. That leaves lean legal teams with a tough choice: use general-purpose AI that isn’t designed for legal workflows, or spend time piecing together tools and prompts, then rechecking everything to meet professional standards. Bradwell closes that gap by making top-tier, domain-specific legal AI accessible to solo and lean firms. Built by a team of former practicing attorneys and AI experts, Bradwell handles multi-step complex legal work and adapts to how you practice over time. Who are your competitors? Bradwell competes with four categories of tools: Where Bradwell wins is as an AI-native environment built to learn and mirror a firm’s institutional knowledge directly within Word.

We’ll invest in integrations with the tools lawyers already live in (e.g., Microsoft 365 and CRMs), and scale distribution through partnerships and product awareness. As we expand, we’ll keep a lawyer-first product roadmap, adding new workflows and practice-area modules, while building customer success that drives sustained adoption and long-term expansion. Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse.

At Bradwell, we’re building legal technology that works for any legal professional, and we take pride in the following: Through these efforts, we aim not only to make an impact within our company, but also to inspire the broader legal tech ecosystem. Anything else you’d like us to know? N/A. Company Name Candle AI Elevator Pitch Candle AI is the legal email assistant that helps small and mid-sized law firms eliminate email overload freeing up hours for higher-value work. It works right inside Outlook/Gmail and 1) instantly pulls client and case details from systems like Clio and Filevine into the inbox, 2) drafts accurate, context-aware replies in second, and 3) manages email templates so you can respond to clients faster. Lawyers and paralegals save up to 90 mins per day on email and respond to clients up to 75% faster. What makes your company unique or innovative? While most legal AI tools require lawyers to leave their inbox, navigate case systems, and learn complex prompts, Candle brings the legal workspace directly into Outlook and Gmail, where legal teams already do a lot of their work, so there’s no workflow change. Our AI leverages firm-specific data, templates, and systems, reducing risk while improving accuracy and compliance. We turn email from one of the biggest time drains in a law firm into a revenue-driver and client service advantage. This helps reduce non-billable time and enables law firms to provide alternative billable models which focus on efficiency and productivity. What problem does your product solve? Attorneys spend a large portion of their day on email (up to 66%), constantly switching between inbox, case management systems, and documents. This leads to a loss of focus, lost billable time, and slower client responses. Candle significantly reduces context switching and drafts accurate email responses instantly, helping legal teams work faster and stay focused. We are also focused on empowering small and mid-size law firms and giving them a competitive advantage through Candle AI. Who are your competitors? There are general AI email assistants such as Superhuman, Copilot and Gemini which focus on individual productivity but are not designed for law firm workflows or shared case context. There are also legal specific tools such as Vesence and August that offer Outlook and Microsoft-based integrations and helpful assistance with email composition and summarizing. Candle AI takes a different approach by treating email as the central workspace for a lot of legal work. Most client communication and case activity already happen in the inbox. By integrating directly with systems such as Clio, Filevine, CasePeer, and INSZoom, Candle AI brings fuller matter context into Outlook and Gmail and connects email to the firm’s systems of record. This allows Candle to automate client communication and support legal teams beyond drafting and summarizing. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://share.descript.com/view/cPjd6cQCzaQ When was the company founded? 2024-09-01. Where is the company located? Austin, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small and mid-sized law firms with flat or contingency fee practices. What is the price of your product or service? $49 per user per month with discounts for annual commitments. Tell us more about your traction. Candle AI is fully launched and currently in use across multiple law firms and practice areas, including immigration, personal injury, family law, real estate, and bankruptcy. Every firm that began as a design partner has continued with Candle on a paid subscription. Candle AI is listed in the Clio App Marketplace and backed by The LegalTech Fund. We recently expanded beyond organic adoption into targeted marketing to accelerate growth. We also support attorneys across the 50 states and globally. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. We are scaling distribution through legal tech marketplace listings, deeper integration with case systems, and partnerships with bar associations and legal service providers. As adoption expands, we aim to become the primary interface for accessing matter information from communication channels and overall managing client communication which strengthens our competitive moat. Our vision is for AI that can structure information in the inbox automatically and allows lawyers to trigger workflows using simple commands directly from the inbox. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our team reflects multiple ethnic backgrounds including immigrant heritage and legal experience. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? One of our co-founders is a former immigration attorney, and the other is an immigrant, which shaped our initial focus on supporting immigration law firms that serve individual immigrants. That lived and professional experience informs how we design Candle AI to reduce administrative burden and improve communication for legal teams working with high email volume and helping clients who are in high stress situations. We support firms by making technology accessible without requiring major workflow changes. We also actively involve attorneys from diverse backgrounds in product feedback to ensure the platform works well for firms of different sizes and practice areas. Anything else you’d like us to know?

We applied in 2024-25 as CaseCrafter but there was already a company by that name. We have since changed our name to CaseCreate, refined our branding, and cleaned up our web functionality so we are ready for this year. Company Name ChronoTracer Elevator Pitch ChronoTracer helps litigators and investigators easily master the facts of their case. It automatically creates a complete, defensible chronology from evidence, transforming emails, texts, social media, call logs, media files, and other formats into structured events. With deterministic extraction and instant, intuitive filtering, teams surface what matters immediately and stop wasting weeks building chronologies by hand. What makes your company unique or innovative? ChronoTracer is the only platform that begins with a full chronology rather than an empty container. It automatically assembles comprehensive, source-linked events across every major evidence type with no hallucinations or guesswork. Automatic, deterministic extraction lets ChronoTracer reach tens of millions of events – something manual, drag-and-drop tools simply can’t do. It requires no integrations, is easy to adopt, and offers fast onboarding, minimal training, and SOC 2–aligned controls. What problem does your product solve? Even with modern e-discovery systems, building a factual chronology remains a slow, manual task. Teams spend countless hours stitching together communications, phone logs, and documents just to understand what happened and when. This slows strategy, obscures patterns, and forces costly, repetitive review cycles. ChronoTracer eliminates that bottleneck by generating a full, structured chronology automatically—and then making it effortless to filter and search for exactly the events, custodians, channels, time periods, or themes teams need. Instead of hunting through evidence, users get clarity on day one instead of week six. Who are your competitors? ChronoTracer competes with spreadsheets and other manual chronology-building approaches, e-discovery and fact-management platforms that require drag-and-drop timelines, digital forensic consultants who produce reports with specialized tools, and various start-ups focused on fact organization. These alternatives rely heavily on human effort, limiting accuracy, slowing insight, and capping the volume they can handle.

Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Large and medium-sized law firms and boutique litigation firms that handle cases with high evidence volumes; investigation teams; corporate legal departments; and government. What is the price of your product or service? Ranges from $5k-$20k per month depending on evidence complexity and volume. Tell us more about your traction. We have supported several large high-profile cases, including an FCPA case, a federal public corruption case and a state RICO case. We are also supporting complex civil cases, internal investigations and international arbitrations. Customers have told us that they could not have handled some of these cases without ChronoTracer. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, ChronoTracer will grow through a mix of direct sales and strategic partnerships. We are currently focused on selling directly to law firms handling complex litigation and investigations. In the coming year, we will expand distribution by partnering with e-discovery service providers and selling directly to corporate legal departments for internal investigations and compliance matters. As the platform matures, we will also work with government contractors to introduce ChronoTracer to investigative agencies, attorneys general, regulators, auditors, and prosecution teams. This multi-channel strategy positions ChronoTracer to become the standard chronology solution across the legal and investigative ecosystem. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our five-person core team is meaningfully diverse. We include individuals from different religious traditions, ethnic backgrounds, genders, national origins, and sexual orientations. These varied perspectives shape how we build ChronoTracer and how we support our customers. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? As a young company, our broader community impact is still developing, but we aim to contribute meaningfully over time. As we grow, we plan to support pro bono litigation and the legal teams pursuing cases that align with our values. Anything else you’d like us to know? I attended last year’s event and the startup showcase, and it was clear how valuable the forum is for new legal technology providers. We would welcome the opportunity to introduce ChronoTracer to this year’s audience. Company Name CollBox. Elevator Pitch CollBox helps law firms get paid 40% faster without turning lawyers into bill collectors. We automate and manage accounts receivable using smart reminders, integrated workflows, and a human-first approach that reduces write-offs, shortens payment cycles, and improves cash flow—while preserving client relationships. $100M+ recovered for small to mid-sized firms. Awarded Best Business of Law App in the 2025 Clio Integration Awards. What makes your company unique or innovative? CollBox is unique because we don’t treat accounts receivable as a software-only problem. Most legal tools stop at sending reminders. CollBox combines intelligent automation with trained, U.S.-based A/R specialists who step in when automation alone isn’t enough. Our platform is purpose-built for law firms, integrating directly into their billing workflows and applying proven collections strategies that preserve client relationships. This hybrid model, AI-assisted automation plus human follow-up, helps firms get paid faster without asking attorneys or staff to become bill collectors. We’ve modernized a critical but neglected function in legal operations by making collections proactive, measurable, and client-friendly. What problem does your product solve? Law firms struggle to get paid on time for work they’ve already completed. Invoices go unpaid, follow-ups are inconsistent, and collections often fall to attorneys or overextended staff – none of whom are trained or incentivized to manage accounts receivable effectively. This results in delayed cash flow, write-offs, administrative strain, and uncomfortable client interactions. Most legal software stops at sending automated reminders and offers no real strategy for collecting overdue balances. CollBox solves this by turning accounts receivable into a structured, proactive process—helping law firms reduce payment delays, recover more revenue, and eliminate the burden of collections from their legal teams. Who are your competitors? CollBox operates in a category that overlaps with, but is distinct from, several existing solutions. Our closest alternatives are law firm billing and practice management platforms (such as Clio, MyCase and Smokeball) that offer basic invoice reminders but stop short of managing accounts receivable or collections strategy. Some firms also rely on in-house staff or traditional collection agencies, which are either inefficient, costly, or harmful to client relationships – especially for work in progress or recently completed matters. Unlike these options, CollBox is purpose-built to manage the full accounts receivable lifecycle for law firms, combining automation with human follow-up in a client-friendly way. We don’t replace billing software or act as a collection agency; we fill the critical gap between invoicing and getting paid. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYKZcWJlYA When was the company founded? 2015-12-21. Where is the company located? Austin, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to mid-sized law firms (~3-30 attorneys). What is the price of your product or service? Starting at $599/month. ARPU is $775/month. Largest client pays $2,280/month. Pricing is based on the volume of clients a law firm bills in a typical month. They are then paced on a flat monthly subscription fee where they keep 100% of dollars recovered. Clean-up is available for older invoices for an additional one-time project fee (avg. of $10,000). Tell us more about your traction. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. CollBox is launching a new funding round in January 2026. The goal of this raise is to encode years of accounts receivable mastery from what is already the leading A/R solution for SMB law firms into an AI-driven operating system that gets law firms paid for their hard work and minimizes attorney & legal staff involvement – quickly, reliably, automatically. There is no clear leader in the market for solving the cash flow crisis that is rampant in SMB law firms and practice management systems’ features aren’t getting the job done. CollBox intends to define the accounts-receivable category in legal and cross $1B recovered for law firms by the end of 2030. Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. CollBox is intentionally building a diverse, multi-lingual, and inclusive team across professional background, geography, and lived experience. Our leadership combines expertise from financial operations, technology, and customer service, including professionals who have worked alongside law firms. We employ team members from a range of geographic locations and career paths, prioritizing skills, empathy, and communication over traditional credentials alone. This diversity of perspective is critical to our human-first approach to accounts receivable, where prioritizing the dignity of law firm clients and maintaining respectful relationships matters even more than the technology we create. As we grow, we are committed to inclusive hiring practices and building a team that reflects the diversity of the legal professionals and clients we serve. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? CollBox contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering barriers to access for law firms that historically lack the resources of larger organizations. By making professional-grade accounts receivable support affordable and scalable, we help small and midsize firms—many of which are minority-owned, women-owned, or first-generation practices—run healthier, more sustainable businesses. We also prioritize respectful, client-friendly communication in our collections approach, reinforcing ethical, inclusive practices that protect both firms and the clients they serve. Internally and externally, we value collaboration, transparency, and empathy, and we actively participate in legal industry events, education, and knowledge-sharing to help firms of all backgrounds succeed. Anything else you’d like us to know? While founded technically in 2015, we created CollBox for law firms just 2.5 years ago when we launched our product into the Clio ecosystem, which earned us recognition as one of the best three new apps in the 2023 Clio Integration Awards. Company Name CounselPro Elevator Pitch CounselPro is the AI financial intelligence engine for legal professionals. We instantly structure years of raw PDF financial history (bank statements, check images, and credit card records) into audit-ready data. Whether tracing commingled assets or auditing bankruptcy filings, we replace weeks of manual entry with instant precision. Our platform delivers a source-linked audit trail, turning chaotic discovery into defensible legal strategy in minutes. What makes your company unique or innovative? While the legal AI boom has focused almost entirely on text (drafting, research, and contracts), CounselPro solves the massive, ignored bottleneck of financial data. We are the first platform to successfully automate the “forensic loop” for legal professionals. Our innovation lies in three key differentiators: What problem does your product solve? We solve the “Financial Discovery Bottleneck.” In high-stakes litigation like divorce, bankruptcy, and fraud, the “smoking gun” is often hidden within thousands of pages of PDF bank statements. Extracting this evidence is currently a broken, manual nightmare. Legal teams are forced to burn billable hours or paralegal budgets on “stare and compare” data entry in Excel. This is low-value grunt work that kills morale and destroys margins. Beyond the cost, this manual process introduces significant risk. Human review suffers from fatigue, leading to high error rates where critical fraudulent transfers or hidden accounts are easily missed. Existing tools fail to bridge this gap. OCR software merely provides raw text, while accounting platforms require pristine data to function. CounselPro solves the disconnect between “raw PDF” and “legal strategy,” eliminating the manual friction that makes financial cases so expensive, slow, and prone to error. Who are your competitors? Valid8, Docuclipper, Lido. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.counselpro.ai/watch. When was the company founded? 2024-07-01. Where is the company located? New York, N.Y. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to midsized law firms specializing in bankruptcy, family law, estate planning, accounting, and PI. What is the price of your product or service? Tiered based on usage, from $100/mo – $5,000+/mo. Tell us more about your traction. In the first six months of active selling, CounselPro onboarded 50 law firms entirely through inbound demand, with zero outbound sales. All acquisition to date has come from referrals, SEO, and GEO-driven discovery, indicating strong product market fit. Customers include solo family law practitioners, U.S. bankruptcy trustees, accounting consultancies, and teams working on complex federal civil rights matters. Adoption is fully self-service. Users discover the product independently, onboard without assistance, and see immediate value on their first set of documents. Revenue is driven by subscription and usage-based expansion as customers apply CounselPro to additional matters. The product is used on live cases, and multiple customers have described it as a “game changer” for financial discovery. Volume: we have already processed over $10B+ in financial transactions, proving our architecture scales to enterprise demands immediately. Retention: we are seeing rapid expansion within firms; once a single partner uses CounselPro for one case, it typically becomes the standard operating procedure for the entire firm’s financial discovery. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our growth strategy is grounded in doubling down on the channels and behaviors that have already driven organic adoption, while expanding the surface area of the product within the legal ecosystem. We will continue to lead with a product-led, self-service motion supported by educational content that addresses real financial discovery problems. This includes practice-area-specific guides, examples, and workflows that help practitioners understand not just how to use the product, but how to apply financial intelligence more effectively in litigation. In parallel, we plan to deepen our presence at industry events where hands-on demonstrations matter, including ABA TECHSHOW and other practitioner-focused conferences. Live exposure to real documents consistently accelerates understanding and adoption. We will also pursue partnerships and integrations with widely adopted practice management and case management platforms that lawyers already use every day. Potential partners include Stretto, Clio, and Smokeball. These integrations allow CounselPro to fit naturally into existing workflows and reduce friction in how financial documents move from intake to analysis. Finally, we plan to expand the product’s analytical capabilities and supported use cases across bankruptcy, family law, fraud, and complex civil litigation while maintaining disciplined growth. Our goal is to become the default financial intelligence layer for legal professionals by making the product indispensable, rather than sales driven. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. As a bootstrapped company, our leadership and workforce reflect a diversity of incentives and perspectives that are often absent in venture-backed legal tech. Because we are not constrained by VC growth mandates, predefined pricing models, or top-down product roadmaps, we stay directly aligned with the day-to-day realities of legal professionals doing complex financial work. This structure allows us to build alongside our users, not above them. Product decisions are driven by real practitioner feedback across firm sizes, practice areas, and geographies rather than by investor expectations. In practice, this results in more accessible pricing, faster iteration on real problems, and tooling that serves solo and small firms just as effectively as larger ones. We believe this proximity to the problem creates a more inclusive product and a more representative legal-tech ecosystem by ensuring that advanced financial analysis tools are not limited to firms with large budgets or enterprise buying power. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We contribute to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering the barrier to advanced financial analysis for firms that have historically been priced out of it. Today, meaningful financial discovery often requires expensive forensic accountants, large internal teams, or enterprise-only software. That reality disproportionately favors well-resourced firms and limits access for solo practitioners, small firms, legal aid organizations, and professionals working in underserved jurisdictions. CounselPro changes that dynamic. By delivering court-defensible financial intelligence through self-service software and usage-based pricing, we make sophisticated forensic capabilities available to a much broader range of legal professionals. This enables more equitable representation for end clients and allows smaller firms to compete on analytical depth, not headcount or budget. We believe inclusivity in legal tech is not just about who builds the software, but who is empowered to use it… and who ultimately benefits from it. Anything else you’d like us to know? The legal industry is at an inflection point where AI adoption is moving beyond drafting and research into operational, evidence-driven workflows. Financial discovery is one of the major categories still dominated by manual processes and spreadsheets. CounselPro exists because this shift cannot be solved with general-purpose AI. It requires defensibility, traceability, and domain-specific logic. We believe this category will define the next wave of legal technology, and we are building the foundational platform for it. Company Name DraftyAI Elevator Pitch DraftyAI is an AI-powered drafting and case-prep tool built specifically for immigration attorneys. It helps lawyers generate high-quality USCIS briefs, motions, and support letters in minutes using their own templates, evidence, and jurisdiction-specific requirements. By automating the most time-consuming part of immigration practice, DraftyAI saves attorneys up to 60% of drafting time while maintaining attorney control, accuracy, and data security. What makes your company unique or innovative? Most legal AI tools are generic, prompt-based, or optimized for research – not real legal work. DraftyAI is immigration-first, built by practicing immigration attorneys, and designed around how cases are actually prepared. We combine guided workflows, template-based drafting, evidence uploads, and jurisdiction-aware formatting to produce filing-ready drafts. What problem does your product solve? Immigration attorneys spend 40–60% of their time drafting repetitive, high-stakes documents, often nights and weekends, because outsourcing is expensive and generic AI is risky. This bottleneck limits case volume, increases burnout, and delays filings for clients. DraftyAI removes drafting as the choke point in immigration practice by turning hours of manual writing into minutes, without sacrificing quality, accuracy, or attorney oversight. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include immigration-specific AI tools such as CaseBlink, Visalaw.ai, Parley, Imagility, and Visas.ai, as well as general legal drafting tools embedded in platforms like Clio or Filevine. Unlike research-focused or form-centric tools, DraftyAI is purpose-built for immigration case preparation and drafting, with an emphasis on real attorney workflows, template control, and filing-ready output. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.draftyai.com. When was the company founded? 2023-04-13. Where is the company located? Coral Gables, Fla. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? DraftyAI primarily serves solo, small, and mid-sized U.S. immigration law firms (1–25 attorneys), including employment-based, family-based, asylum, and removal defense practices. Our customers are firms handling moderate to high case volume that need to scale drafting and case preparation without increasing headcount or risking quality, compliance, or burnout. What is the price of your product or service? Various monthly plans starting at $250 per person. Tell us more about your traction. DraftyAI is a live, revenue-generating SaaS platform used by immigration attorneys across the U.S. We have dozens of active paying law firms and a growing pipeline driven primarily by founder-led education, referrals, and conference exposure. Customers report saving up to 60% of drafting time on complex immigration filings. DraftyAI has been featured in Bloomberg Law and the ABA Journal, selected for AILA’s Innovators Spotlight, and is actively used by firms handling high-volume, high-stakes matters. We are seeing steady month-over-month growth in users and engagement, with strong retention among firms that incorporate DraftyAI into their daily workflows. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, DraftyAI will expand from an immigration-specific drafting solution into a broader case preparation and workflow platform for immigration law firms. Near-term growth focuses on deepening value for existing customers through enhanced drafting workflows, collaboration features, and integrations with popular immigration tech stacks. Mid-term, we will scale distribution through strategic partnerships, CLE-driven education, and bar association engagement. Long-term, our goal is to become the default infrastructure layer for immigration case preparation, supporting firms as they scale volume, improve quality, and reduce burnout, while maintaining strict attorney oversight and compliance. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. DraftyAI is led by a woman immigration attorney and immigrant founder, and was built alongside two co-founders who are also immigrants. We come from different professional backgrounds (law, engineering, and operations) and built this company through years of trust, collaboration, and shared values rather than a traditional startup pipeline. As immigrants and children of immigrants, our lived experiences directly inform the way we approach immigration law, legal technology, and the responsibility that comes with building tools lawyers rely on for high-stakes work. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? DraftyAI contributes to a more inclusive legal tech community by making advanced AI tools accessible to immigration lawyers who are often left out of traditional legal tech, especially solo and small immigration firms, many of which are led by women, immigrants, and first-generation professionals. We focus on affordability, ease of use, and education. That means transparent pricing, free trials, and free resources that help lawyers understand and use AI responsibly without needing a technical background or enterprise budget. Our goal is to make modern legal technology feel usable and safe for everyday practitioners, not just large firms. Anything else you’d like us to know? DraftyAI was built by immigration lawyers who have lived the realities of high-stakes casework, client anxiety, and burnout. Our approach to AI is intentionally conservative, attorney-centered, and compliance-first. We believe the future of legal tech isn’t about replacing lawyers; it’s about protecting their judgment, time, and well-being, especially in practice areas where the human impact is profound. Company Name EstateMin Elevator Pitch EstateMin modernizes trusts and estates departments. We replace pen-and-paper and fragmented processes with a structured, digital intake workflow that captures accurate client information upfront, reduces administrative burden, and improves the client experience from first contact. What makes your company unique or innovative? EstateMin was built to replace the pen-and-paper workflows still common in trusts and estates. Co-founded by a former Clio Product Manager, probate paralegal and a technical co-founder, we use AI to rapidly ship updates and new features based on real law firm needs. Since launching in September, EstateMin has been adopted by over 20 paying firms. What problem does your product solve? Collecting intake information for every asset, debt and beneficiary in an estate takes hours when done manually. EstateMin replaces this fragmented, pen-and-paper process with a structured digital intake, saving significant staff time, reducing errors, and allowing firms to start matters with complete and usable client information from day one. Who are your competitors? Our primary competitors are pen-and-paper intake processes and legacy workflows. In the software market, alternatives include Trustate and Decision Vault, with many of our customers having already converted from these solutions. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/34b38e1f115440fb972a945ff85a370c. When was the company founded? 2025-09-08. Where is the company located? Boston, Mass. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to mid-sized firms with a trust and estates department. What is the price of your product or service? $99-$250 per month. Tell us more about your traction. EstateMin began in Ireland, where we secured early customers and validated the core intake workflow. To support scale, we prioritized deep integrations and partnered with Clio before expanding into the U.S. market. In August, we onboarded three U.S. pilot firms—100% of which converted to paying customers. Since launch, EstateMin is live with firms in over 10 U.S. states, supporting multiple users and active matters. To date, more than 70 estates are live on the platform, with law firms and their clients actively using the product. We have also had four one-call closes, where firms signed up and paid within a single 40-minute demo and are now active users. One Florida firm said, “I had high expectations and they have been exceeded.” Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, EstateMin will scale from client intake into a full estate lifecycle platform. Our near-term focus is growth within trusts and estates practices, with a target of 300 law firms by the end of 2026, representing approximately $950K in ARR. From there, we will expand into a digital estate vault, extending access to accountants and wealth managers. Using AI, the platform will continuously track and update clients’ entire estates during their lifetime, creating a shared, accurate source of truth across professional advisors. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. EstateMin is led and co-founded by a female CEO. Diversity and inclusion are core to our leadership perspective and inform how we build, partner with law firms, and support the legal community. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? EstateMin actively contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community through both formal policies and everyday culture. We are led by a female founder, prioritize inclusive hiring and collaboration practices, and intentionally partner with and support underrepresented voices in the legal profession. Inclusion is embedded in how we build our product, engage with law firms, and foster an open, respectful team culture. Anything else you’d like us to know? In just three months, EstateMin has onboarded multiple paying customers, built a strong pipeline, and secured partnerships that position us for significant growth in 2026. Our momentum is driven by a highly complementary founding team combining deep legal domain knowledge, senior product leadership from Clio, and a technical co-founder with strong execution capability. We have also recently closed a small funding round to accelerate delivery and scale. Company Name EstateScribe Elevator Pitch EstateScribe is an AI-powered drafting platform built specifically for estate-planning attorneys. We turn a client intake data, interviews, and client documents into fully formatted, jurisdiction-specific estate plans in minutes, using context-aware automation designed, built, and tested within an estate planning law firm. From intake, to drafting, and client funding on the backend, EstateScribe automates the entire process, so attorneys can focus on what really matters, advising their clients. What makes your company unique or innovative? EstateScribe is the first AI-native drafting engine built exclusively for estate planners. Unlike tools that bolt AI onto legacy templates or offer a simple chatbot, we designed our system from the ground up to mirror the attorney workflow—starting with intake, continuing through interview mapping and logic validation, and ending with a fully-formatted, attorney-level plan. Our platform uses a hybrid approach combining deterministic legal logic, a proprietary knowledge map, and a context-aware generative model trained on structure rather than client data. Every edit, decision, and dependency across the matter is connected. When the attorney updates a key fact or changes a distribution scheme, the entire drafting system updates downstream provisions automatically and transparently. This makes EstateScribe the first tool that can actually think like an estate-planning attorney, rather than merely assemble documents. Streamlining intake, voice transcribing client interviews, drafting in seconds vs. hours, and always keeping the attorney in the loop is the core of the EstateScribe platform. While legal tech broadly is crowded, estate planning is uniquely underserved. Most innovation has focused on litigation, CLM, or large-firm workflows. Trusts and estates — especially for solo and small firms — remain dominated by legacy template tools and manual processes. What problem does your product solve? Estate-planning attorneys spend an enormous amount of time on repetitive drafting: combing through intake forms, reconciling notes, updating provisions, formatting long trust documents, and making sure every related clause stays consistent. Traditional automation tools require rigid templates, complex interviews, or manual exports into Word – slowing attorneys down instead of speeding them up. We built this while running an Estate Planning firm, so we know these problems because we’ve lived them firsthand. We found that almost 90% of our time was spent on intake and drafting, rather than the actual fun and useful part of running a law firm, which is spending time with more clients to ensure their plans are as effective as possible. EstateScribe solves this by eliminating the manual drudgery of intake, drafting, and client communication. Attorneys upload their intake worksheet or fill out our interactive digital interview, and EstateScribe generates a jurisdiction-specific, cleanly formatted estate plan that reflects attorney preferences, standard clauses, and state law nuances. The system flags and explains every AI-generated section, ensures consistency across all documents, and preserves attorney control. The result: faster drafting, dramatically fewer errors, and the ability for attorneys to scale their practice without burning out or hiring additional staff. Estate planning is one of the few areas of the law that consistently bills at a fixed fee rate, so the more efficient attorneys can be, the higher their margins or the ability to adjust pricing to have as competitive advantage in the market. My co-founder and I didn’t start this journey hoping to be legal tech founders, we started hoping to build a main-street law firm that could offer top tier estate planning for clients in our town. With all the amazing things happening in the legal tech ecosystem, we were ready to sign up for the latest and greatest AI product for estate planners, yet nothing came. After scheduling every demo out there and trying to wrap our heads around why no one was changing this industry like they were PI, Litigation, and Corporate Law, we decided it was time to do something about it. Who are your competitors? Our primary competitors are WealthCounsel, InteractiveLegal, HotDocs and other legacy drafting platforms. We have competition from the direct-to-consumer side from companies like Trust&Will.com, Vanilla, Wealth.com, Legal Zoom, and Estate Guru. We firmly believe in the importance of the estate planning attorney in the process. The estate-planning market broadly breaks into three distinct verticals, each serving a different customer with different incentives, economics, and risk profiles. 1. Direct-to-Consumer Estate Planning. Examples: LegalZoom, Trust & Will. These platforms sell estate-planning documents directly to consumers, typically at low price points. Strengths: Limitations: These tools serve basic needs, but they are not substitutes for attorney-led planning, especially as estates grow more complex. 2. B2B Through Wealth Managers/RIAs. Examples: RIA-embedded estate planning tools, advisor-led document platforms (wealth.com, vanilla, Estate guru). These solutions position estate planning as a value-add for financial advisors, often using attorneys behind the scenes. Strengths: Limitations: These platforms work well for select advisor-driven use cases, but they don’t meaningfully modernize how estate-planning attorneys actually practice law. 3. EstateScribe’s Vertical: B2B for Attorneys. EstateScribe is built specifically for estate-planning attorneys – not consumers and not intermediaries. We believe this is the most defensible and scalable segment because: Our approach preserves attorney oversight while unlocking efficiency, consistency, and scale. The majority of estate plans in the U.S. are drafted by solo and small-firm attorneys, yet this group has been historically underserved by both consumer platforms (too simplistic), and enterprise legal tech (too expensive and rigid). By focusing on B2B for attorneys, EstateScribe: This creates a structurally defensible position that consumer-facing or advisor-centric platforms cannot easily replicate. EstateScribe does not compete by replacing attorneys or bypassing them. We compete by making attorneys dramatically more effective, enabling them to serve more clients –including underserved middle-class families – while maintaining quality, compliance, and trust. A core principle of EstateScribe’s strategy is that attorneys must see us as partners, not threats. While the other verticals bypass the attorney entirely or reduce their role a post-hoc rubber stamp, we are intentionally designed to be the opposite. Demo Video URL (if you have one) N/A. When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Jackson, Wyo. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small and solo estate-planning firms, boutique trusts and estates practices, and any attorney looking to scale without increasing staff overhead. Our platform is built for the 1–10 attorney firm where time savings, workflow efficiency, and document quality have an immediate and direct economic impact. However, we also see opportunity to address estate planning departments within larger firms to help increase the volume and capabilities in that specific niche. What is the price of your product or service? $350/month/seat (1 free paralegal, additional paralegal +100). Custom enterprise pricing for large firms. Tell us more about your traction. EstateScribe has secured pilot commitments from estate-planning firms in Wyoming and Texas – our initial rollout states – and has expanded into early interest from firms in Maryland and Kentucky. We recently secured a co-marketing agreement with 8am, providing us access to a broad distribution channel. We presented on the Solutions Showcase stage at Legal Tech Connect NYC, have been invited to meet with the Wyoming State Bar Estate Planning Counsel, and attended The Legal Tech Fund Summit 2025. Multiple firms are in our onboarding pipeline as we prepare for a public launch. Our MVP has already demonstrated the ability to produce attorney-level estate plans in minutes, dramatically accelerating drafting and intake workflows, and is in use at our law firm. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. In five years, EstateScribe will be the default drafting and workflow platform for estate-planning attorneys nationwide – trusted, embedded, and indispensable – while enabling firms to scale profitably and better serve the underserved middle-class market. We believe technology should amplify attorney judgment, not replace it. EstateScribe is built on the premise that senior legal expertise remains essential, even as drafting, intake, and workflow become increasingly automated. Our growth strategy follows a deliberate, credibility-first path: 1. Establish category leadership in standard to mid-complexity estate planning. We will initially dominate the $250,000–$15 million net-worth segment, where the majority of estate-planning demand exists and where inefficiencies most directly constrain firm growth. This segment offers the strongest combination of volume, repeatability, and immediate ROI for attorneys. 2. Expand upward without alienating the profession. Rather than positioning EstateScribe as “AI replacing lawyers,” we position it as infrastructure for modern estate-planning firms. As adoption grows, we will increasingly support higher-complexity practices by accelerating drafting, enforcing consistency, and reducing operational drag—without compromising attorney oversight. 3. Product expansion driven by real practitioner demand. Our V2 roadmap includes asset protection planning, complex irrevocable trusts, business formation services, probate automation, and related workflows. These expansions will be released incrementally, informed by real-world usage data and direct feedback from practicing attorneys—not speculative feature development. 4. State-by-state credibility, then national scale. We are launching in beachhead states (Wyoming and Texas), where our Chief Legal Officer is licensed and actively practices, ensuring product validity and practitioner trust. While the platform is architected for all 50 states, we will continue expanding through pilot firms in each jurisdiction to validate document quality and state-specific compliance. Our goal is nationwide availability by the end of 2026. 5. Relationship-led growth. Our core growth engine is user trust. EstateScribe was built directly out of an estate-planning practice, and we believe sustained adoption depends on deep practitioner alignment. As a result, our early scaling investments prioritize customer success and support. This approach ensures high retention, strong word-of-mouth growth, and a product that evolves alongside its users. We have unique insights from running an active estate planning practice and can sell to our customers better than anyone else. Our hope is for founder-led sales to get us established and growing exponentially until we can justify/it makes sense from a growth perspective to hire an outbound sales team. By combining disciplined market entry, practitioner-driven product expansion, and a clear respect for the attorney’s role, EstateScribe is positioned to become the long-term infrastructure layer for estate-planning firms nationwide. Have you received outside funding? $250k in friends-and-family round in addition to reinvesting our law firm revenue into the company. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. We are a first-generation founding team operating out of rural markets in Wyoming and Idaho – areas traditionally underrepresented in legal tech innovation. Our leadership backgrounds span law, trust administration, engineering, and entrepreneurship. We work with distributed engineering talent, including individuals from underrepresented groups in software development and law. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? By equipping small and solo firms with advanced drafting tools, EstateScribe expands access to high-quality estate planning for middle-class families, rural communities, and underserved regions that often lack affordable estate planning services. Our software enables attorneys who serve diverse demographics to increase capacity and reduce costs. We’re working on engagement with bar associations and are working with community-based practitioners to ensure that modern drafting tools are not limited to large or urban firms. Our goal is to democratize technology that historically required high overhead, expensive training, or large staff. Anything else you’d like us to know? EstateScribe was built because we lived the problem. As small business owners who learned to run and operate a law firm, we know how difficult, expensive, and time-consuming drafting and other manual workflows can be, and how deeply it affects access to estate planning nationwide. Our approach is not theoretical; it’s based on thousands of real client interactions. We believe estate planning is one of the most impactful areas of law, yet one of the most underserved by modern technology. EstateScribe is bringing true innovation to this critical practice area at a time when demand is rising, and attorney capacity is shrinking. Company Name Immediator Inc. Elevator Pitch Gut instinct, tradition, and billable hours currently drive the process in determining when to begin settlement negotiations in personal injury litigation. Immediator saves both sides time and money by applying data analytics to signal when settlement negotiations are likely to succeed. Developed by experts in law, data science, and insurance, Immediator is an AI-driven decision support tool that uses data, not speculation, to provide an objective method for evaluating optimal settlement timing. What makes your company unique or innovative? Litigation consumes time and money because decisions about when to negotiate settlement rely on instinct instead of statistical insight. Lawyers and insurers spend months debating when a case is ready to resolve, during which costs rise, reserves stay idle, and relationships strain under uncertainty. Immediator brings the discipline of data to the art of negotiation. Our neutral, AI-powered platform is the first of its kind because it provides an objective evidence-based measure of settlement readiness, a percentage we call PRISM (Probability of Imminent Settlement), helping both sides know when it’s a fruitful time to begin negotiation. Built by litigators, claims professionals, and data scientists, Immediator applies secure, legally engineered analysis that protects privilege, safeguards data, and delivers clarity professionals can act on confidently. The result is faster settlements, lower costs, and smarter decisions. Unlike systems that manage files or scrape data to create documents, and unlike human mediators who rely on intuition, Immediator defines a new category— settlement intelligence. Immediator does the job of a human mediator. Unlike a human mediator who parachutes in after the close of discovery and the expenditure of massive amounts of litigation costs, Immediator goes to work even before the lawsuit is filed, comparing the parties’ alignment on key issues to signal when to begin settlement negotiations, even if the optimal time is before discovery closes. What problem does your product solve? There is no system that tells plaintiff lawyers and insurance companies the right moment to settle, so insurance defense lawyers end up controlling the timeline. Plaintiffs (and their lawyers) and insurance companies are aligned in their interest in keeping costs down and resolving cases sooner. Defense lawyers are paid by the hour. This misalignment of interests often leads to unnecessary delays, unnecessary litigation expenses, and 55% of claim dollars lost to transaction costs. Immediator is the solution. Immediator uses data to detect the right moment for settlement and triggers direct negotiation between plaintiffs and insurers, preventing months of avoidable billable hours and other potentially unnecessary litigation expenses. Who are your competitors? Immediator has no direct competitors other than traditional human mediators. Most emerging legal tech platforms focus on facilitating communication or expediting document preparation, not determining settlement readiness. Immediator’s differentiation lies in using data science to model alignment and readiness objectively, while safeguarding confidentiality and neutrality. Immediator’s closest B2B SaaS competitors are Bot Mediation, EvenUp, Riskonnect, and Discover Docket. None of these tools offers neutral, data-driven predictive analysis of optimal settlement timing. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zngh4I7VEbs. When was the company founded? 2025-06-27. Where is the company located? Savannah, Ga. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our target customers are liability insurers (and their adjusters) and personal injury (plaintiff) lawyers. The goal is to become the go-to platform for personal injury litigants by demonstrating time and cost savings for both sides. What is the price of your product or service? Immediator plans to charge an annual subscription fee per user and a separate charge per case/claim handled on the platform. The specific rates will be negotiated with the customers and subject to a specific user agreement. The prices will begin small, in order to build our customer base, and increase over time as our platform’s value to customers grows. Customers will be offered bundles to reduce cost. We anticipate that our product will become sticky, which will provide us with opportunities to expand our pricing to match its value. Tell us more about your traction. Every plaintiff lawyer we have spoken with is interested in the tool and many have become angel investors. We have reached out to one major liability insurance company so far (a company everyone would recognize by name and immediately know their slogan), and that company has expressed great interest. We are working on a pilot project with them for beta testing, data partnership, and ultimately as a future customer. The product is not yet ready for customers, so we have not pursued sales opportunities. We are focusing our energy on finishing the product and working with our interested partners. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Immediator plans a land and expand strategy. Initially, we will work to grow our customer base by selling the benefits of the platform to liability insurers, because Immediator ultimately has the potential to save insurance companies as much as 40% on their litigation costs, including hourly attorney fees and expenses. Plaintiff attorneys will be invited to the platform by the insurance companies. We plan to reach out to plaintiff lawyers independently to demonstrate the benefits and neutrality of Immediator. We will provide white glove service and inexpensive pricing to our initial customers so as to show them the value the product can add to their bottom line. We plan to offer software integration with the litigation tools already utilized by our customers so that adoption can be seamless. We will allow direct, encrypted communication and transmission of evidence and documents between the parties, with firewall protection preserving confidentiality and attorney-client privilege. The end goal is to make the platform so universally used and sticky that litigants and insurers cannot afford not to use it. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Two of Immediator’s four founders are women, and one is a U.S. military veteran. Maury Argento, a former captain in the U.S. Army, will be our CEO, and she has also served as our head of product development. Dr. Jill Ferdinands, our chief data scientist, created the algorithm we call PRISM (Probability of Imminent Settlement), and she will lead the company as it refines its AI-driven model as more and more data are obtained and analyzed. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? The heart of Immediator is its neutrality. Rather than utilizing the good old boys’ network or defaulting to gut instinct, Immediator will be the first platform to bring hard science and numbers as the driving force behind the decision when to begin settlement negotiations. The vast majority of human mediators are men. Immediator was created by women to replace the old way of doing business with rationality, as opposed to emotion. Anything else you’d like us to know? Immediator was conceived by our co-founder, Jason Crawford. He represents catastrophically injured victims, and he has practiced for over 32 years. Over that time, he has watched his clients’ recoveries be consistently diminished because litigation is so expensive. His goal has always been to put more money in his clients’ pockets by being a good steward of their case expenses, and a dollar saved to a client is even better than a dollar added to the settlement because a percentage of the latter is shared with the plaintiff lawyer. Reduced litigation spending makes a real difference in personal injury victims’ lives, but it also adds to the bottom line of the insurance companies. Understanding this fundamental alignment of interests ultimately led to the creation of Immediator. It also helped that Jason was married to a Ph.D. who specializes in data science. Company Name Lawdify Elevator Pitch AI-native evidence analysis and claims preparation for construction disputes, akin to a contractor-side equivalent of what EvenUp does for PI plaintiffs. A contractor drops project materials (contracts, emails, daily logs). Lawdify OCRs, parses and organises everything by parties, dates and issues (delays, variations) and generates a claim (or defence) pack with a fact-checked timeline, a structured claim/response, and flags for weaknesses in evidence. What makes your company unique or innovative? We are building the first AI-native collaboration platform purpose-built for construction and infrastructure disputes, designed to create a true network effect across the entire ecosystem: downstream users like law firms and expert witness firms, midstream claims consultants, and upstream in-house contractor teams. What makes us different is that we have engineered Lawdify from day one to work for global projects. Founded in Singapore and now expanded into Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, the U.K., and Dubai (with the US next), we have continuously tuned the platform to handle two realities that break most legal tech at scale: the idiosyncrasies of evidence across jurisdictions and the complexity of working across languages. At the core of the product is a dispute intelligence layer that turns project documentation into a living “Case Brain” of the contract: rights, obligations, and how they connect to change requests, time extension requests, and variations over the life of a project. Using graph and vector databases, we map and trace large volumes of evidence to claims, and track how the case narrative evolves over long time horizons. This gives teams a clearer, continuously updated view of what the contract says, what the evidence supports, and how the dispute is developing (across borders, languages, and stakeholders). We are the only AI tool with an Excel add-on that connects directly to the “Case Brain” behind the matter allowing for fact-checking massive spreadsheets (such as project schedules, progress logs, cost trackers, and payment applications) against thousands underlying emails, reports, meeting minutes, and other project records. What problem does your product solve? Lawdify solves the problem of inefficient, adversarial construction dispute resolution. Contractors often lose time, money, and margin due to poorly organised evidence, unclear claims, and late-stage legal intervention. Disputes cost the industry over $80 billion annually and take 13-18 months to resolve on average, driven largely by incomplete records, unsubstantiated claims, and poor contract compliance. By replacing fragmented workflows and costly legal prep with an AI-native, claims-ready workspace, Lawdify cuts down dispute resolution time, reduces legal fees, and gives contractors a faster, fairer path to resolving or avoiding disputes entirely. Who are your competitors? (Somewhat) Direct competitors: Indirect competitors in eDiscovery (Relativity, Everlaw, Reveal, Luminance) but they usually stop at review and only relevant when a construction claim has become a full-blown dispute rather than focus on dispute prevention and pre-dispute management. General copilots like MS Co-pilot, GPT Enterprise, Gemini Enterprise etc while they can draft claims given sufficient context, they are not really built to ingest and structure years of messy evidence. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/4lsf-J_K4lc. When was the company founded? 2023-09-09. Where is the company located? Singapore. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Law firms with construction disputes practice, claims consultants, and contractors. What is the price of your product or service? From $10K/year to $100K/year depending on size of the team, volume of documents, and complexity of the workflows. Tell us more about your traction. Working with some of the largest law firms in Asia specialized in complex and high value construction disputes, claims consultants, expert witness firms, and construction contractors. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Year 1 (2025). We are growing Lawdify by tapping into disputes teams in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Japan that focus on high stakes disputes including construction. Year 2 (2026). We expand across APAC with law firm’s construction disputes and expand by pulling in the rest of the ecosystem on each matter (claims consultants, expert witnesses, and law firms) as collaborators on the same structured record, creating a network effect and repeatable referrals. We start US expansion focusing on mid-tier contractors. Year 3 (2027). We replicate this playbook to create the go-to platform for construction disputes with contractors based in the US that have global presence including in APAC. Year 4-5. We become the default disputes infrastructure for construction matters by standardizing these workflows across firms and experts, and extending from claims preparation into full-stack dispute handling (from intake through tribunal-ready filings) Have you received outside funding? $1M – $5M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Eliza Jiang (CEO & co-founder): Chinese descent (Guangzhou native, native Cantonese and Mandarin speaker), culturally Latina since I grew up in Panama (Panamanian national, fluent/native Spanish speaker). First generation Chinese immigrant to Panama, first one to attend university in the family with international student financial aid. First lawyer/professional in the family and paid law school with scholarships and student loans. Lived and worked in Toronto, Ottawa, New York, China, Hong Kong, Singapore. Hong Kong permanent resident. Max Godoy (CTO & co-founder): Chilean national, grew up in the island of Chiloe in south of Chile, self taught coder and have been coding since 14. Trained as engineer and recruited by Singaporean aerospace engineering company. Lived in Asia, 2x startup founder of AI and blockchain analytics company. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Lawdify contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by expanding what “legal tech” serves and who it is built for. We are building from APAC outward for a global user base, not the other way around. That means supporting cross-border matters, multilingual evidence, and region-specific dispute processes so teams in markets that are often underserved by US-centric tools can still benefit from high-quality AI workflows. We also focus on a part of the legal ecosystem that is frequently left out of innovation: construction and infrastructure disputes, where outcomes affect livelihoods, public works, and small-to-mid-sized contractors. By making evidence organization, fact-checking, and claims preparation faster and more accessible, we help smaller teams (including boutiques and lean in-house groups) operate with capabilities that previously required large headcount and expensive systems. Finally, our collaboration approach brings together the full set of stakeholders on a matter (law firms, expert witnesses, claims consultants, and contractors) on a shared, structured record. That reduces information asymmetry and makes dispute work more transparent, consistent, and accessible across different teams, geographies, and working styles. Anything else you’d like us to know? We started a more general AI legal tech tool for disputes case preparation and have found a wedge and great use case in construction disputes, which is why we are doubling down on this industry. Company Name LawFi, Inc. Elevator Pitch LawFi offers flexible and customized legal fee financing options, allowing clients to access legal services while paying the costs over time. LawFi’s legal fee financing platform combines financial technology, a proprietary loan origination system, and utilizes AI to assess market and court data to determine the optimal term and loan amount for each matter. LawFi can approve a legal fee loan in minutes, not days or weeks. Now, lawyers can offer clients a better way to pay for legal services. What makes your company unique or innovative? LawFi is not a litigation funding provider investing in high-stakes contingency legal cases. LawFi is the first installment loan product specifically designed to finance legal service fees. Our proprietary AI-driven decision engine uses alternative data (employment, income, cash flow) to approve more clients, not just those with prime credit. We enable law firms to embed financing directly into their workflows, depositing funds directly into client trust accounts, transforming legal payments, and providing access to justice. What problem does your product solve? LawFi helps address the access-to-justice gap by enabling the 166 million Americans living paycheck to paycheck to afford legal representation. We remove financial barriers for clients who are either unable to pay upfront fees or prefer to finance their legal services, while ensuring that lawyers receive payment upfront. This approach increases the number of clients served and reduces receivables. Who are your competitors? Competitors include credit card companies, Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) providers, and general personal loan platforms. However, these traditional loan options are not tailored or customized for legal services. They do not underwrite the legal matter being financed, and often have higher costs, lower approval rates, and less flexible terms for legal matters. We differentiate ourselves from BNPL solutions targeting the legal market because (i) LawFi is the lender and underwriter; we are not simply a lead pass-through to a thrid-party BNPL underwriter or lender; (ii) Our technology enables us to approve a significantly higher percentage of applicants than BNPL solutions, by using open banking technology and cash flow underwriting allowing us to evaluate the ability to repay based on a broader range of factors; (iii) Our proprietary algorithms underwrite the legal matter being financed to establish what a matter should cost and the proper repayment terms based on the type of dispute, jurisdiction, market and court data; (iv) We provide law firms with an advanced platform and embedded finance tools and resources to quickly and easily add financing to their payment options; (v) LawFi has developed the first fully functional and bar complaint legal fee financing platform, not just a link found in a payment processor platform payout page; and (vi) Unlike a BNPL solution, LawFi has developed the first fully compliant refund policies that do not claw back fees or loan proceeds from law firms. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://bit.ly/lawfi_demo, Password: LegalFintech. When was the company founded? 2021-11-08. Where is the company located? LawFi is a remotely operated company with headquarters located in Jacksonville, Fla. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? LawFi customers include lawyers, law firms, and their clients (borrowers). LawFi can target the full spectrum of lawyers and law firms, from sole practitioners to large law firms. Our initial focus is on small to mid-sized law firms, solo practitioners, and their clients. We are targeting firms focused on serving the needs of individual consumers and small business owners, making loans for services in practice areas such as family law, trusts & estates, civil litigation, and other consumer-facing areas, as well as business law, transactions, and commercial litigation. What is the price of your product or service? LawFi legal merchant accounts are free to lawyers and law firms. We do not charge any set-up, implementation, or other subscription fees. Like other credit card networks, lenders, or BNPL financing options, LawFi only charges its law firm clients a Merchant Discount Rate (“MDR” or “financing fee”) on the total loan amount for the matters we finance after the firm has approved and accepted the financing and confirmed receipt of the funds in their account. Our fees range from 7.5% to 15% of the loan amount. Borrowers pay a fixed interest rate (significantly lower than other financing options) and a 2% loan origination fee, which is added to the loan amount and paid over the term of the loan. Tell us more about your traction. LawFi launched its platform in June 2025 at the 75th Annual Florida Bar Convention. We have developed a growing waitlist and have partnered with Cordell & Cordell, the nation’s largest family law firm, and others to offer our legal fee loans in a limited Florida rollout. We plan to expand the rollout across the entire state of Florida to complete our pilot program and then expand across the country. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. LawFi plans to scale nationwide by partnering with bank sponsors, credit unions, law firms, bar associations, legal payment processors, and other legal technology providers to expand its digital lending platform and AI-driven underwriting capabilities. We will continuously enhance our technology, broaden our network, and develop new products to support access to justice for millions of Americans. Have you received outside funding? Yes, LawFi has been capitalized to date by founders, friends, and family (angels), raising $3M in cash and significant non-cash contributions from team members. We are currently negotiating three term sheets for our first seed credit facility of $25 million, with an accordion feature to $150 million, to support our Florida pilot program. Additionally, we are preparing to launch our first institutional equity offering for between $5M and $10M. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. LawFi’s leadership team comprises professionals from diverse backgrounds in legal, finance, technology, compliance, and operations, with experience spanning major fintech firms, law firms, and financial institutions. We emphasize building strong, inclusive, and equitable teams. Our current team includes minorities and women. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LawFi’s mission is to make legal services financially accessible to all, especially middle-class Americans and those who are underserved. By bridging the Access to Justice Gap, we empower diverse communities to obtain legal representation. Anything else you’d like us to know? LawFi is the inventor of the Legal Fee Loan and the only company offering a proprietary legal fee lending platform purpose-built for the legal industry. Our technology is designed to transform the way legal services are paid for and accessed, ensuring that everyone can obtain legal services regardless of their financial situation. Company Name LawQi Elevator Pitch The AI transformation is underway. It is undeniable, and its impact will be enormous. The firms, bar associations and legal workplaces that develop the legal professionals who drive the transformation will thrive. The ones that hesitate will be stuck wondering how it all changed so fast. LawQi delivers what most AI training can’t: true literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change. Affordably scalable for any organization, it equips the people who power competitive advantage. What makes your company unique or innovative? LawQi is where lawyers use AI to learn AI. Legal professionals build real competency through real work, not passive lectures or demonstrations. LawQi builds real AI competency. The first innovative differentiator is the learning method itself. The platform serves as both personal AI tutor and experimental workspace, where users master prompting techniques, test capabilities, and analyze documents in real-time through interactive discovery. This builds transferable skill and valuable AI understanding and intuition that works across any AI platform. Comprehensive modules cover AI fundamentals, advanced techniques, the tools landscape, and critical professional topics including liability and insurance coverage. Users navigate content at their own pace, and each lesson incorporates hands-on experimentation with immediate feedback to lock in and extend the learning. Core course material is supplemented by 100+ topic explainers in LawQi’s memory, drawn on to support answers and presented as clickable citation links when relevant to a learner’s conversation with the AI tutor. Our approach sidesteps the biggest pitfalls in AI training: LawQi delivers true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change. The second innovative differentiator is the delivery model. A fully-managed, turn-key solution for bar associations, law firms and other organizations. Whether supporting larger initiatives or serving as the complete program for organizations lacking training infrastructure, LawQi scales to create true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change organization-wide. For lawyers in small firms, bar associations are the institutions legal professionals trust above even their firms to prepare them for an AI-powered future. However, smaller bar associations lack the time and funding to prepare their members for the AI transformation, and larger bar associations lack the capacity for dynamic delivery, timely content creation and agile platform integration of emerging models. Among firms, smaller and many mid-size firms lack dedicated training staff. Meanwhile larger firms implementing specialized tools are too stretched to provide foundational training for their broader workforce. Whether supplementing larger initiatives within a firm or serving as the complete program for organizations lacking training infrastructure, LawQi scales to create true AI literacy, foundational competency, and actual behavior change organization-wide. The third innovative differentiator is the price. We price as low as $1 per member per year for bar associations and as low as $1 per FTE per month for law firms for organizations engaging our global platform (some conditions apply). Private instances, including the ability to incorporate the bar or firm’s learning materials and capable of customization to their priorities, are also available. The final innovative differentiator is our foundation. We built LawQi as the evolution of our experience developing and supporting the “AI Academy” programs of the Ontario Bar Association and Canadian Bar Association. Our technology partnership with Praxis AI means we deliver our programming on award-winning platforms that are battle-tested across major universities and enterprises – a leading-edge stack that combines pedagogical excellence with enterprise-grade security and scalability, from an organization profiled by Anthropic and described by them as “leading the AI revolution in education.” Our foundation speaks to our ability to immediately accommodate ALL associations and firms recognizing the AI transformation now underway and the urgency of equipping the people who power their capacity to meet the moment. What problem does your product solve? Poor AI literacy and competency among lawyers is now an industry-scale problem, and it calls for an industry-scale response. LawQi is the only provider immediately capable of delivering baseline AI training at an industry scale. No amount of webinars, pilots or even firm-wide rollouts of legal AI products changes the fact that the rate of AI advancement means that all facets of legal knowledge work and practice will be impacted in unknown and unknowable ways throughout 2026 and beyond. While some lawyers, firms and legal organizations are at the vanguard, most are at the starting line, unaware that a race has even begun. We have an urgent, mass-education need and a dawning realization that our traditional thinking and approaches to technology training takes us in the wrong direction when it comes to AI. I’d go so far as to say that lawyers in particular have at most 12 months left to develop a holistic understanding of generative AI in the context of what it means for the practice of law and administration of justice before the window closes for good. That’s how fast AI is evolving. If we don’t act, we risk the majority of our AI learning opportunities being reduced to those focused on operating systems we didn’t design, managing processes we don’t understand, in a transformation we never guided. It doesn’t have to be that way. The ultimate trajectory will be of our own making, but our collective ability to guide the transformation means we need a critical mass with baseline understanding of how AI works now. We don’t have that baseline yet because legal AI advancement, innovation and adoption has been sparse, diffuse, and either seen as optional or for the foolhardy. Our institutions (firms, bar associations, courts and legal departments of all sorts) haven’t embraced meaningful full-firm, full-bar or full-org AI training to build that baseline. Indeed, before LawQi, it wasn’t even an option. It is now. Who are your competitors? All CLE providers, whether private, bar affiliated, non-profit or commercial, and whether targeting individuals, firms or bar associations. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/6uDpwAgxBqE. When was the company founded? 2025-05-06. Where is the company located? Ottawa, Ontario. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Bar associations (or similar) of any size (from small county to the largest state bars), firms and legal organizations of 50 FTE (all roles) or larger. Our offering is scalable to organizations of any size. What is the price of your product or service? We price as low as $1 per member per year for bar associations and as low as $1 per FTE per month for law firms for organizations engaging our global platform (some conditions apply). Private instances, including the ability to incorporate the bar or firm’s learning materials and capable of customization to their priorities, are also available at higher price points. Tell us more about your traction. The first iteration developed for the benefit of the 16,000 member Ontario Bar Association (OBA) came in November 2024. Launched in beta as the “AI Academy,” it was conceived by Colin Lachance, then holding an appointment as the OBA Innovator-in-Residence, with a dual purpose of fulfilling his mandate to AI education for the OBA and for evaluating the potential of this particular learning approach. Following a content update and learning path refresh, its popularity among Ontario lawyers grew, as did demand from other Canadian jurisdictions for access. In July 2025, the 40,000 member Canadian Bar Association contracted with LawQi (the newly incorporated business that assumed management of the OBA AI Academy and now provides the distinct LawQi Global platform) to roll out the CBA AI Academy nationally (including assuming OBA’s financial responsibility for Ontario beyond the term of the prior arrangement). Throug the CBA, the AI Academy has been accredited for 2.75 hours of Ethics/Professionalism and 0.25 of substantive law. The commercial version of LawQi outside the ambit of the CBA relationship took shape over the early fall, with successful beta testing across multiple customer groups, and the go-to-market content and platform experience were finalized in early November 2025. Clients in pilots or anticipated to onboard in January/February 2025 include: placements at two national and three large regional law firms with a combined FTE of 4,000), state-wide availability to over 1500 team members across 50+ legal aid offices, roll-outs to teams of 50-100 of three different pro bono organizations in three different jurisdictions. Several other active client conversations likely to result in pilots or launches by the end of February include three state bars, two county bars, three trial lawyers associations and one legal insurance company (for the benefit of its insured attorneys). In addition, LawQi will be placed at no-charge in at least 3 law school classes. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our goal for 2026 is to serve as many lawyers as we can. In a recent “Lawyers who Learn” Lawline podcast, we talked about upskilling 100,000 attorneys by 2030, but we are confident that we can (and must) go well beyond that in just 2026 to build the baseline competency we believe the profession needs. That is our sole priority for 2026 and we will keep our offering and price points in line with that focus. Beyond 2026, consistent and vocal user feedback from among our AI Academy and LawQi base highlights the high demand for experiential training in other aspects of attorney work. Our relationship with Praxis AI also reveals a number of promising avenues for ultra-personalized learning, professional development and even practice activities. We will closely monitor user feedback as it relates to demand for those services and plan for product expansion beyond AI training in 2027. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. N/A. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LawQi advances inclusion by partnering with bar associations – the institutions serving the entire legal profession, not just elite firms. Similarly, we also prioritize support of legal aid, pro bono and not-profit organizations through pricing our offerings to them at bar associations rather than law firm levels. Our bar association pricing – as low as $1 per member per year – makes professional-grade training accessible regardless of practice setting or resources. Solo practitioners, small firm lawyers, legal aid attorneys, and underserved communities access the same quality training as large corporate firms through their bar membership. This prevents a divide where only well-resourced organizations develop AI competencies while others fall behind. Bar associations serve diverse memberships across practice areas, geographic locations, and career stages. By empowering these trusted institutions to lead their members through the AI transformation, LawQi reaches the full spectrum of legal practice—from rural solo practitioners to urban specialists, from new lawyers to experienced practitioners transitioning to new technologies. The platform’s self-directed design accommodates diverse learning styles, experience levels, and schedules. Professionals navigate modules on fundamentals, advanced techniques, tools landscape, and critical professional topics at their own pace, removing one-size-fits-all constraints disadvantaging learners with different backgrounds or time availability. The embedded AI assistant provides personalized support, meeting users where they are rather than assuming baseline technical literacy. Legal professionals from non-technical backgrounds, different generations, or varied educational experiences all develop essential competencies—from prompting techniques to understanding liability implications—ensuring the entire legal community can participate in shaping the AI transformation of law.

Company Name LegalBridge Elevator Pitch LegalBridge is AI-powered case management built exclusively for immigration law firms. We automate the entire visa workflow: document categorization, cover letter drafting, recommendation letters, exhibit generation, form filling, client portals, case tracking, invoicing, and final export. Attorneys cut case prep time by 60% while doubling client capacity. Serving 70+ U.S. law firms, from solo practitioners to 20-attorney practices. What makes your company unique or innovative? LegalBridge is the only immigration case management platform with native AI across every workflow stage. Five core innovations set us apart: Unlike legacy platforms that digitize paper workflows, LegalBridge reimagines them. We built for AI-first, not AI-added. What problem does your product solve? Immigration attorneys face a crushing operational burden. Preparing a single O-1A or EB-1A case requires organizing hundreds of documents, drafting 20-page cover letters, generating dozens of exhibit labels, filling government forms, and coordinating with clients, employers, and recommenders across time zones. Most firms rely on outdated software designed before modern AI existed. The result: paralegals spend 15+ hours per case on manual document organization. Attorneys write the same cover letter sections repeatedly. Client communications scatter across email, text, and phone calls. Form errors cause RFEs that delay approvals by months. LegalBridge solves this by consolidating every immigration workflow into one AI-powered platform. Document uploads auto-categorize. Drafts generate from templates trained on successful filings. Client portals centralize communication and document collection. Questionnaires pre-populate government forms. Exhibit lists generate and reorder with drag-and-drop. The outcome: attorneys handle 2x the caseload without adding headcount, case preparation time drops by 60%, and RFE rates decrease through AI-driven consistency checks. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include INS Zoom, Docketwise, Cerenade and E-Immigration. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/RG2UySU8K5k?si=l8nL4qzz9I276XBT. When was the company founded? 2023-11-03.

LegalBridge is founded and led by immigrants. Our leadership team represents India’s technology and startup ecosystem, bringing firsthand understanding of the immigration challenges we solve. The company includes team members from multiple backgrounds, gender identities, and regions across India and the U.S. Diversity is embedded into our lived experience and our product vision immigration is our founders’ personal story, not just a market opportunity. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? LegalBridge actively supports the immigrant founder and legal tech communities from diverse background through several initiatives: We host events for our community of 20,000+ immigrant founders and professionals, creating networking opportunities and sharing immigration knowledge freely. These events connect entrepreneurs navigating their own visa journeys with attorneys who can help. Our pricing structure democratizes access to advanced technology. Solo practitioners and small firms pay $5,000/year, receiving the same AI capabilities that larger firms access. This ensures immigration attorneys serving underrepresented communities can compete with well-resourced practices. We partner with immigration attorneys who serve asylum seekers, DACA recipients, and other vulnerable populations, offering discounted access to ensure technology reaches those handling the most critical cases. As immigrant founders building for immigration law, we are committed to ensuring this practice area, which directly shapes who gets to participate in American society, has access to the best possible technology. Anything else you’d like us to know? LegalBridge exists because three immigrants decided the system that shaped their lives deserved better technology. We built every feature immigration attorneys actually need: AI document categorization, document chat, client collaboration portals, AI-drafted cover letters and recommendation letters, drag-and-drop exhibit lists, email questionnaires, automated form filling, final export, case status tracking, one-click invoicing, and one-click retainer generation. One platform. No juggling systems. We bootstrapped without outside funding because we wanted to build for customers, not investors.

New entrants bolt AI onto old architectures. LegalBridge is AI-native from day one. We are profitable, growing, and obsessed with making immigration attorneys more effective. TECHSHOW recognition would accelerate our mission and introduce LegalBridge to firms still struggling with fragmented, outdated tools. We would be honored to demonstrate how AI transforms immigration law practice. Company Name Litmas Inc. Elevator Pitch Litmas is an AI powered tool designed specifically for litigation attorneys that digitizes the workflows litigators use to move a case through the litigation process, in one unified platform. Litmas AI enables attorneys to responsibly draft motions, pleadings, discovery documents, organize evidence and conduct in-context verifiable case law research. This combination of AI enhanced workflows results in substantial time savings and greater accuracy and visibility. What makes your company unique or innovative? Litmas AI is built for litigation, not general legal work. It connects facts, evidence, and case law into one drafting workflow instead of producing free form AI text. Every result is thoroughly traceable to source documents and cited authority, so attorneys can verify accuracy instantly. This makes Litmas usable in real litigations, where mistakes and hallucinated citations are unacceptable. What problem does your product solve? Litigation work is slow and manual. Attorneys repeatedly draft similar motions, pull facts from scattered documents, and double check research under deadline pressure. Generic AI tools make this worse by hallucinating case law and forcing lawyers to verify every single output. Litmas solves this by connecting facts, evidence, and precedent into a single workflow, reducing drafting time while maintaining professional reliability. Who are your competitors? Our competitors include traditional legal research platforms such as Westlaw and Lexis, AI assisted drafting tools, and newer AI legal assistants such as Spellbook or Clearbrief. These products either focus primarily on research, provide general AI chat experiences, or address isolated drafting tasks. Litmas differs by combining motion drafting, evidence organization, and case law application into a single litigation focused workflow. with fully sourced outputs designed for use in active cases.

Litmas was built based on practicing litigators input and logic every step of the way and is used daily on real life litigation cases throughout the country, today. Company Name PowerPatent Inc. Elevator Pitch PowerPatent is an AI co‑pilot for patent lawyers that turns invention disclosures and drawings into near‑ready patent applications in minutes. It automates first drafts, checks consistency between claims, spec, and figures, and flags patentability risks so firms can file stronger patents faster, increase flat‑fee margins, and free attorneys to focus on strategy, not slog work. What makes your company unique or innovative? PowerPatent is unique because it combines a highly automated, “full‑spec in minutes” drafting engine with built‑in diagnostics that continuously check quality, consistency, and patentability while you work.​ End‑to‑end AI drafting co‑pilot. Unlike tools that only help with snippets or templates, PowerPatent can generate background, summary, detailed description, and even claims from disclosures, figures, and part lists in a single, guided flow.​ The system is designed so attorneys start from an almost complete draft, then refine and strategize, instead of building the application from scratch.​ Embedded quality and risk checks. PowerPatent layers in AI‑powered consistency checks, functional‑claim analysis, and automated cross‑referencing between claims, spec, and drawings to catch gaps and ambiguities that weaken enforceability.​ It also uses prior‑art and Section 103 conflict prediction signals to highlight potential patentability issues early, making the drafting process more strategic, not just faster.​ Workflow and ecosystem integration. The platform integrates drafting, review, docketing, and USPTO Private PAIR connectivity, so firms do not have to juggle separate tools for composition, checking, and prosecution.​ Cloud collaboration features let inventors and attorneys co‑develop drafts, with AI suggesting additional embodiments and variations to broaden protection and reduce design‑around risk.​ What problem does your product solve? PowerPatent solves the problem that patent drafting and prosecution work in law firms is slow, labor-intensive, and margin‑compressed, by automating first‑draft generation and routine prosecution tasks so attorneys can spend more time on strategy and client counseling.​ Core problems for law firms Traditional patent drafting requires many hours of manual background, claim, and detailed description drafting per case, limiting throughput and making flat or capped fee work less profitable.​ Attorneys and staff lose time to repetitive tasks such as reusing boilerplate, aligning specs and drawings, and ensuring formality compliance across multiple jurisdictions, which increases turnaround time and risk of error.​ How PowerPatent addresses them For drafting, PowerPatent’s AI co‑pilot turns an attorney’s input (claims, invention summary, drawings/part lists) into a comprehensive first draft in minutes, including background and detailed description sections aligned with the figures.​ For prosecution, PowerPatent supports the full patent lifecycle by first turning raw invention disclosures into high‑quality, consistent applications that are easier to prosecute efficiently and strategically. During prosecution, it tracks office actions, automates responses, and surfaces metrics so teams can control cost and maximize term and portfolio strength. Once assets are granted, the platform helps map patents to products and markets, inform valuation and monetization strategies, and then periodically flag low‑value or non‑core assets for pruning using portfolio views and AI‑driven keep‑vs‑drop analysis.​ The system analyzes large patent datasets to propose accurate, guideline‑compliant language and structure, reducing drafting errors and downstream prosecution rework while allowing lawyers to focus on tailoring claims and legal strategy.​ Impact on law‑firm economics By compressing drafting time and automating low‑value steps, firms can increase associate productivity, handle more matters per attorney, and make fixed‑fee patent work more scalable and profitable.​ Cloud collaboration and workflow features let distributed teams and outside counsel iterate on drafts faster, improving responsiveness to clients and shortening time to filing without adding headcount.​ Who are your competitors? PowerPatent competes in the AI patent‑drafting/prosecution‑support space with a large and fast‑growing field of tools.​ Direct AI drafting competitors: DeepIP (formerly Davinci)​, Rowan Patents​, Dolcera IP Author​, ClaimMaster (AI‑assisted drafting and proofreading)​, Qatent​​, IP Author/IP Author.ai, Patently Create​, ipagent.ai​, PatentGPT​, XLSCOUT Drafting LLM​, Paximal​, Added Matter​.

Law‑firm and investor traction: PatentPC uses PowerPatent to streamline drafting and prosecution on active client matters, validating that the workflows support sophisticated U.S. practice and flat‑fee economics.​ Tran.vc applies PowerPatent across a growing portfolio of AI, robotics, and deep‑tech startups, demonstrating scalability from single cases to multi‑asset portfolios.​ Inventiv channels early‑stage founders into the platform, showing that it can compress time from disclosure to filing and support monetization‑driven IP decisions.​ In‑house corporate traction. Cisbay, Micronoc, Monolithic 3D, and IntraAction use PowerPatent in‑house to draft, refine, and manage patent filings more efficiently than with outside counsel alone, using automation to cut cost while maintaining attorney‑level quality.​ These internal deployments show that the platform works not only for law firms but also for lean corporate IP teams that need repeatable workflows for drafting, prosecution metrics, and portfolio pruning. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. PowerPatent plans to grow over the next five years by deepening product capabilities across the patent lifecycle, expanding into more practice settings (firms, in‑house, and government), and building a partner ecosystem that drives distribution and data advantages.​ Product expansion. PowerPatent will evolve from “AI drafting co‑pilot” into a full lifecycle platform covering invention capture, drafting, prosecution analytics, portfolio valuation, monetization, and pruning. The roadmap emphasizes more domain‑specialized AI models, richer automation for office‑action responses, and tools that tie patents directly to products, revenue, and risk so legal teams can make board‑level decisions from within the product.​ Go‑to‑market and customer segments. Growth will focus on three core segments: patent boutiques and mid‑size firms doing flat‑fee work; in‑house teams at IP‑intensive startups and growth companies; and eventually larger enterprises and public‑sector organizations that need scalable IP workflows. Channels will include direct sales to firms, partnerships with VC funds and incubators (leveraging Tran.vc and similar relationships), and integrations with existing IP management and docketing systems to reduce switching friction.​ Data, ecosystem, and defensibility. Over five years, PowerPatent aims to compound its data advantage by learning from anonymized drafting and prosecution outcomes to continuously improve drafting quality, claim strategy suggestions, and keep‑vs‑drop recommendations. The company will also pursue alliances with search, analytics, and IP valuation providers, positioning PowerPatent as the drafting and decision‑making layer that sits on top of the broader patent data ecosystem.​ Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. PowerPatent is led and staffed mainly by minorities, with a founding and core team that is Asian and African Americans, bringing perspectives that are historically underrepresented in both legal tech and the patent profession. This diversity shows up not only in ethnicity, but also in career background, combining patent attorneys, engineers, and entrepreneurs who have navigated immigration, first‑generation professional, and cross‑border innovation ecosystems. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? PowerPatent contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by putting minority founders, inventors, and patent attorneys at the center of its product and ecosystem. The company is led and staffed entirely by minorities (Asian and African), and it actively mentors and trains underrepresented founders, students, and junior practitioners on how to use AI to access high‑quality patent protection without needing a large‑firm budget. PowerPatent also collaborates with minority‑owned firms, diverse startup ecosystems, and global technical communities, ensuring that voices from outside the traditional AmLaw and BigTech corridors help shape how AI is applied to patents and IP strategy. Anything else you’d like us to know? PowerPatent is built by practicing patent attorneys and engineers who live the daily realities of drafting, prosecution, and portfolio strategy, so the product is grounded in real‑world workflow and ethics rather than hype. The team is already embedded in the legal community through teaching, mentoring founders, and speaking on AI and patents, and views ABA TECHSHOW as a long‑term partnership opportunity to help solo, small, and mid‑size firms safely adopt generative AI. PowerPatent is committed to transparent, human‑in‑the‑loop use of AI, clear data‑handling practices, and continuous feedback from practitioners so that automation strengthens, rather than erodes, professional judgment and access to high‑quality patent representation.

Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Well it’s really just me right now so I guess that inherently means zero diversity. 🙂 Kidding aside, I would say my background as a non-attorney with a product background from customer facing retail is generally diverse vs the traditional players in this market. Outside, customer-centered focus -> innovation. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We are based in the heart of Atlanta which is extremely diverse and my office is a tech co-working space that is surrounded by diversity. I will likely hire from within this talent pool as we grow. Anything else you’d like us to know? I’m a father of two awesome kids that recently stepped away from a 20-year corporate career with The Home Depot with the last 15 years focusing on leading product management teams. I’ve had a long passion for wanting to solve customer problems and having gone through my own recent divorce I spotted an opportunity to make an impactful change. SayWell is taking a fundamentally different approach to improving coparent communication (and the fallout that lawyers ultimately deal with). The legacy providers try to stop parental fighting by documentation and eventual hand slapping. SayWell is an in-conversation moderator positioned to make a real impact on co-parents lives. Company Name SecureSplit. Elevator Pitch SecureSplit is an AI powered divorce financial platform for family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs. We replace spreadsheets and email with a single workflow for client intake, organizing income, expenses, assets, and debts, running state specific support and property division calculations, and producing clean, court ready financial reports that save time and reduce costly errors. What makes your company unique or innovative? Most tools in family law focus on documents, not the numbers. SecureSplit is built for the financial side of divorce, from intake to court ready reports, in one browser-based workflow. Both spouses enter data once, the system standardizes it, runs state specific support and division calculations, and flags gaps or inconsistencies with AI assisted checks. It is collaborative, multi state, and API ready, so firms can plug a modern divorce financial engine into the rest of their legal tech stack. What problem does your product solve? Divorce lawyers, mediators, and CDFAs are stuck juggling spreadsheets, PDFs, email, and outdated calculators to make financials court ready. This manual, fragmented workflow is slow, error prone, and hard to delegate, which drives up costs and stress for clients. SecureSplit solves this by turning messy inputs from both spouses into a single structured dataset so professionals can run support and division calculations and generate clean reports in a few clicks. Who are your competitors? Our main competitors are legacy divorce financial tools like Family Law Software, DissoMaster, and other state specific support calculators, plus the “DIY stack” of Excel, PDFs, and email that firms still rely on. We compete by offering a single, modern workflow that covers intake, calculations, and reports in one place. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://securesplit.com/investor-page When was the company founded? 2025-01-01. Where is the company located? Newark, Del., HQ; San Diego, Calif. and Greensboro, N.C. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our primary target is solo and small to mid-sized family law firms, mediators, and divorce focused financial professionals (CDFAs and RIAs). Over time, we will expand to larger firms and law departments, but our initial focus is on the teams that live in the day-to-day financial details of divorce and need a faster, more standardized workflow. What is the price of your product or service? We use a tiered subscription model. Professional plans for firms, mediators, and CDFAs start around $100 dollars per professional per month, with premium and enterprise pricing based on seats, features, and overall size of the firm. The consumer version is offered as a separate low-cost monthly subscription on essentials.securesplit.com. Tell us more about your traction. We are currently pre revenue with approximately 50 professional customers using SecureSplit on live divorce matters, including family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs. Usage is growing through referrals and a waitlist of additional firms, and we are seeing strong engagement and feedback through regular product sessions and Fireside Chats as we prepare for full launch. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, we will grow SecureSplit by first converting our current professional users into paying subscribers and deepening adoption within their firms. In the near term, we are focused on launching in a small set of key states, refining our core workflows through design partnerships with family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs, and adding integrations to the legal tech tools they already use. As we prove retention and unit economics, we will expand to additional states, introduce premium and enterprise tiers, and develop advanced AI assisted modeling and reporting. Longer term, we will scale through channel partnerships, education and certification programs for divorce professionals, and a complementary consumer product that feeds organized cases directly into our professional network. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our leadership team is gender diverse and comes from different professional and cultural backgrounds, spanning financial planning, divorce practice, AI, and customer experience. One founder brings 20 years in regulated financial services and divorce work, while the other has led product and CX teams in software. We also work with advisors across geographies, ages, and practice types, which helps us design SecureSplit for a wide range of families and firms. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? We design SecureSplit to lower the financial and technical barriers that keep many families from getting quality help. By standardizing the numbers work, we make it easier for smaller, community focused firms and solo mediators to serve clients who have been historically underrepresented or priced out of traditional advice. We are also building a diverse network of testers and advisors, including women led and minority led practices, and we intentionally use plain language, accessible UX, and remote friendly onboarding so a wide range of professionals can participate in and benefit from the legal tech ecosystem. Anything else you’d like us to know? SecureSplit is at a pivotal stage, with a functional beta in use by about 50 professional users and a broader launch ahead. We are actively seeking design partners among family law firms, mediators, and CDFAs who want to modernize the numbers side of divorce. If selected, we will demo live case workflows, share lessons from 20 years in divorce focused financial planning, and show a clear path from spreadsheets to a modern standard for financial disclosures. Company Name Simone. Elevator Pitch Simone Reception is an AI-powered virtual receptionist built exclusively for law offices. It answers every call instantly with a calm, professional, human-like voice, gathers intake and conflict-check information, and routes calls intelligently. Clients call when life happens. Simone will be there to answer. What makes your company unique or innovative? Simone is unique because it is built exclusively for law firms and designed around legal realities, not generic AI use cases. Unlike traditional virtual reception or generic AI voice tools, Simone is purpose-built for legal intake. It understands the structure of law firms, the importance of conflict checks, confidentiality, ethical boundaries, and the difference between a new lead, an existing client, a court, or an opposing party. Simone is not just answering calls. It is executing legal-specific workflows. It gathers structured intake data, captures names for conflict searches, routes urgency intelligently, and integrates directly into tools like Clio and HubSpot so information is immediately usable, not buried in voicemail or transcripts. What makes Simone truly innovative is balance. It delivers 24/7 responsiveness for clients while protecting lawyer focus and wellbeing. Clients get a calm, professional first voice when life happens. Lawyers and their staff get fewer interruptions, better data, and control over when and how humans step in. Finally, Simone improves over time. As a firm evolves, Simone adapts to its language, services, and priorities, becoming a smarter front door rather than a static receptionist. In short, Simone brings enterprise-grade AI capability to small and mid-sized law firms in a way that is ethical, controlled, and deeply practical. What problem does your product solve? Simone solves the problem of missed calls, interrupted work, and poor first impressions in law firms. Legal problems do not arise on a schedule. Clients often call when they are stressed, anxious, or in crisis, and many of those calls happen outside office hours or when staff are unavailable. When calls go to voicemail, firms lose potential clients, create frustration, and miss critical information. At the same time, answering every call pulls lawyers and staff away from higher-value work and contributes to burnout. Research on workplace interruptions shows that when professionals are pulled away from focused work, it takes an average of over 20 minutes to fully regain concentration. In legal practice, where work is complex and high-stakes, frequent call interruptions quietly erode productivity, accuracy, and wellbeing. Simone reduces that hidden cost by answering calls without breaking lawyer focus. Simone solves this by ensuring every call is answered instantly, professionally, and consistently, 24/7. It captures structured intake and conflict-check information, routes urgency appropriately, and integrates directly into firm systems so nothing is lost or delayed. Simone recognizes that every call is not a 1-minute interruption but a 20-minute productivity hit. The result is a better client experience, fewer interruptions for legal teams, improved lead capture, and a calmer, more sustainable way for law firms to stay responsive without being always on. Who are your competitors? AI Reception services (i.e. CasefloodAI), Live Virtual Reception services (i.e. SmithAI, Ruby, LexReception), Generic AI Voice or Call-Handling platforms (i.e. Google Voice, Twilio), and In-House Reception or Voicemail Demo Video URL (if you have one) N/A. When was the company founded? 2025-10-01. Where is the company located? Toronto, Ontario, Canada Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small, medium and large law firms. Legal Aid and pro bono services. What is the price of your product or service? Starting at $250 per month. Tell us more about your traction Our traction is early, but it is real and practitioner-led. Simone Reception is currently being actively used and tested inside a live law office environment (Evolve Family Law). We are not building this in isolation. It is operating in real conditions, handling real client calls, and being refined based on day-to-day legal workflows. We have validated three key things already: Our immediate traction focus is deliberate. We are prioritizing product quality, ethical guardrails, and legal-specific workflows before scaling sales. The next phase is converting this validated internal use into a structured beta with a small group of law firms, followed by broader commercial rollout. In short, Simone is already proving value inside a real law office, replacing existing paid solutions, and generating strong early demand. We are building on a foundation of real usage, not assumptions. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Our five-year growth plan is deliberate, phased, and grounded in how law firms actually adopt technology. Year 0–1: Product excellence and focused market entry Our priority is to become the best AI receptionist in the legal market, not the fastest-growing generic tool. We will focus on small and mid-sized law firms in Canada and the US, refining Simone Reception through real-world use, structured pilots, and early paying customers. During this phase, we will deepen legal-specific workflows, expand integrations with core legal platforms, and build a reputation for reliability, professionalism, and ethical design. Growth will be steady and intentional, driven by referrals, conferences, and partnerships rather than aggressive sales tactics. Years 1–3: Geographic expansion and platform maturity. Once Simone Reception is proven and stable at scale, we will expand more aggressively across North America, Europe and Australia. This includes deeper US market penetration, multilingual support, and stronger relationships with legal software providers. At this stage, Simone becomes not just a receptionist, but a trusted front door for law firms, handling intake, triage, scheduling, and payments in a way that feels seamless and human. Years 3–4: Product expansion within the Simone ecosystem. With a strong customer base and mature core product, we will expand beyond reception into adjacent AI agents designed specifically for law firms. These may include intake specialists, internal assistants, and client communication agents, all built on the same ethical and legal-first foundation. Existing customers become the primary growth engine, adopting additional Simone products rather than churning to competitors. Years 4–5: Enterprise adoption and global reach. By year five, Simone will be positioned as a category-defining legal AI platform. We will pursue enterprise partnerships with larger firms, legal networks, and professional service providers, while expanding into additional jurisdictions where legal workflows are similar. At this stage, Simone will be deeply embedded into law firm operations, with strong recurring revenue, high retention, and a brand associated with trust, calm, and professionalism. Throughout all five years, our guiding principle remains constant: We grow by solving real problems, protecting lawyer wellbeing, and improving the client experience, not by chasing hype or replacing humans for its own sake. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our leadership team is diverse in professional background, geography, and perspective, which directly strengthens how we build and grow Simone Reception.

These differences mean Simone is shaped by varied and multidisciplinary viewpoints, not a single discipline or worldview, and the product is informed by real users (lawyers and clients) and real technical constraints (secure, compliant systems). Each founder contributes a unique lens on problem solving, and that blend produces a more thoughtful, usable, and ethically grounded AI reception product. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Simone contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community by lowering barriers to access, reducing bias at the first point of contact, and supporting healthier ways of practicing law. First, Simone expands access to legal services by ensuring that every call is answered professionally, regardless of when it comes in. Many people reach out to law firms during moments of stress, crisis, or vulnerability, often outside traditional office hours. By being available 24/7, Simone helps ensure that people who cannot call during business hours are still heard and treated with respect. Second, Simone is designed to reduce bias at the front door of the legal system. Human reception, while valuable, can be influenced by fatigue, assumptions, or unconscious bias. Simone delivers a consistent, calm, and professional experience to every caller, regardless of accent, background, or emotional state. Built-in multilingual and accent support further improves accessibility for clients who may otherwise struggle to communicate clearly or feel understood. Third, Simone supports inclusion within the profession itself. Smaller firms, rural practices, and solo lawyers often lack the resources to provide round-the-clock reception or advanced intake systems. Simone gives these firms access to enterprise-level capabilities without requiring large teams or overhead, helping level the playing field between small and large firms. Finally, Simone contributes to a more sustainable and humane legal tech ecosystem by protecting lawyer and staff wellbeing. By reducing constant interruptions and after-hours pressure, Simone helps create healthier work environments. A more sustainable profession is one that can retain diverse talent over time, rather than burning people out. In short, Simone promotes inclusion by improving access for clients, consistency and fairness at intake, and sustainability for legal professionals, all while being built intentionally for the realities of legal practice. Anything else you’d like us to know? Yes. Simone was built by practitioners, not observers. This product emerged from real frustration inside a working law office and has been shaped through live use, not hypothetical workflows. We are intentionally building slowly and responsibly, with a focus on trust, ethics, and real-world impact rather than hype or speed alone. We believe AI in law should reduce stress, improve access, and support healthier professional lives. Simone is our contribution to that vision, and we are committed to building it thoughtfully, transparently, and in partnership with the legal community. Company Name AutoDox Co., Ltd. Elevator Pitch While everyone builds chatbots, Sonar solves the real pain: formatting. Every lawyer knows the frustration: you inherit a document from a colleague, and spend the next hours fighting with the ruler, restarting numbering for the tenth time, or succumbing to the format painter’s dark arts. Sonar eliminates the pain with one click. Your house styles, applied instantly, perfectly, inside Microsoft Word. What makes your company unique or innovative? (1) Formatting-First Philosophy: Legal Tech goes AI-first. Sonar goes formatting-first. We’re the only legal tech solution that fully automates document formatting end-to-end—the bottleneck everyone feels but nobody addresses. (2) Built Under Constraint, Built to Last: We launched in Thailand with zero legal tech infrastructure, no VC funding, and legal teams operating on razor-thin margins who demanded results from day one – not vague promises of efficiency gains. These constraints forced us to build leaner and smarter than well-funded competitors. What started as a limitation became our edge: enterprise-grade capabilities at a fraction of the cost, designed for real lawyers with real budgets doing real work. What problem does your product solve? (1) The Formatting Bottleneck: Legal work demands perfect formatting, but achieving it manually is brutally time-consuming. Nobody wants to deliver a poorly formatted document to the client, so lawyers spend hours fighting with the numbering ribbon, the ruler, and the format painter, trying to push a paragraph exactly 0.1 inches to the left, or fix that paragraph number that won’t fix itself despite clicking “Restart at 1” fifty times. Unlike knowledge gaps that disproportionately affect juniors, formatting is the great equalizer: it wastes everyone’s time, period. A senior partner at 2 AM before a client deadline faces the same broken numbering as a first-year associate, and there’s no way to delegate it to a secretary or junior. (2) The Broader Workflow Crisis Beyond formatting, legal workflows break down in predictable ways. Junior lawyers doing first-pass redlines without access to the firm’s best precedents. Teams rely on manual error checks that inevitably miss critical issues. Expertise remains trapped in senior lawyers’ experience rather than codified in playbooks anyone can follow. Each inefficiency compounds, turning substantive legal work into administrative chaos. Sonar tackles both problems head-on. First, formatting: we instantly reformat entire documents to match any house style. Second, workflow: our complete suite handles definition tracking, redlines, error checks, playbooks, automations inside Microsoft Word, and an Outlook integration that enables seniors to teach juniors to write professional emails. All of this lives where you work – natively in Word and Outlook. Just open Word, launch Sonar, work smarter. Who are your competitors? Document Formatting: No direct competitors. We’re the only solution that fully automates legal document formatting end-to-end. However, given our broad suite (Word, Outook, Web), we operate in competitive spaces with several established platforms, including: Definitions/Error Checks: Contract Companion (Litera), Definely, LawVu Draft (formerly ClauseBase). AI Drafting/Redlining: Luminance, Litera One, Spellbook, DraftWise, GC AI, and a new one launching every Tuesday. AI Legal Assistant (Legal Research, Workflows, Tabular Reviews): Harvey, Legora, Midpage, DeepJudge. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/HmeX8E8XKSI. When was the company founded? 2023-04-09. Where is the company located? Bangkok, Thailand. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? In-house legal departments of all sizes, small to mid-size law firms What is the price of your product or service? We offer a generous free-forever tier with no credit card required. Paid plans start at $49/month for solo practitioners and scale to $79/month for unlimited usage. Custom enterprise pricing is available for corporate clients and larger teams. Tell us more about your traction. Successful implementations (selection): Law Firm: A leading international law firm in Southeast Asia chose Sonar Legal after evaluating multiple legal tech vendors. In-House: The legal department of Thailand’s largest conglomerate selected Sonar Legal following a comprehensive pilot and evaluation. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. We’re currently a team of seven in Bangkok, with proven traction at both ends of the market. Our next phase focuses on deepening Southeast Asian presence while preparing for international expansion. We’ll grow the team to 20 by the end of 2026, adding dedicated sales and customer success roles to convert our pipeline and support enterprise accounts. Revenue from regional clients will fund controlled expansion into markets with similar pain points: starting with Singapore and Hong Kong, where international firms already recognize the formatting problem. By 2027, we’ll leverage these reference clients to enter the US and UK markets, where legal tech budgets are larger but the core frustration is identical. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Sonar Legal was born diverse. Greek and Thai co-founders, 50% female leadership, team spanning Europe and Southeast Asia with experience in US, EU, and Thai legal systems. Five people, multiple jurisdictions, different legal traditions and cultures shaping everything we build. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Sonar Legal democratizes access to advanced legal AI through a generous free-forever tier and pricing starting at $49/month. This makes enterprise-level capabilities accessible to solo practitioners, small firms, and underrepresented legal professionals traditionally priced out of premium technology.2. Education & Awareness in Developing Markets. Our founders are actively promoting legal tech adoption in Southeast Asia through guest lectures at ASEAN universities, preparing the next generation of lawyers for an AI-powered legal landscape. Anything else you’d like us to know? N/A. Company Name StreamSettle, Inc. Elevator Pitch We believe that if negotiating parties have a safe place to be reasonable, they will be. StreamSettle is a secure platform that instantly resolves cases by acting as a triple-blind “deal detector.” Both sides confidentially input their true settlement threshold. Our system detects if an overlap exists. If it does, the claim settles automatically at the midpoint. If no overlap, the data remains hidden, and no fees are charged, making StreamSettle truly risk-free for both sides. What makes your company unique or innovative? What problem does your product solve? The core problem is that offers and demands are unreliable data points. In an effort to gain leverage, both sides routinely exaggerate their positions. They then rely on this flawed data to answer a critical question: “Can this case settle?” When the gap between these postured numbers is wide, parties falsely conclude they are “too far apart.” This forces them into years of costly, unnecessary litigation to reach a settlement result that likely existed from the start. It is a classic case of “garbage in, garbage out” – bad data drives efficient markets into expensive gridlock. Who are your competitors? Direct Competitors (Automated Negotiation): Indirect Competitors: Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex6EHDV-l0U. When was the company founded? 2022-10-29. Where is the company located? Cypress, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? We target a two-sided market: 1. The “Demand” Side: Plaintiff law firms. These range from large “billboard” firms with thousands of active files to mid-sized litigation boutiques and solo firms. These firms are motivated by cash flow velocity and reducing their own overhead costs per case. 2. The “Supply” Side: Insurers & Defense law firms: We target Claims Directors cutting LAE, and forward-thinking Defense Partners who differentiate themselves by offering clients (insurers or self-insured businesses) speedy, efficient resolution. What is the price of your product or service? We operate on a Risk-Free Success Fee model. We charge a fee only if a settlement is reached on the platform. Fee: 1% of the total settlement amount per party. Cap: Maximum fee of $1,000 per party ($2,000 total per case). We plan to raise the cap as we scale, except for our early adopters. No Upfront Costs: There are no subscription fees, setup costs, or charges for testing thresholds that do not result in a deal. Tell us more about your traction. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Years 1-2: The Texas Beachhead (Density Phase): Year 3: Product Expansion (Stickiness Phase): Years 4-5: National Scale (Expansion Phase): Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. StreamSettle is proudly woman-co-founded and led (Chrysa Jones, COO) and veteran-founded (Joe Jones, CEO, Marine Corps Veteran). Beyond the founders, we have intentionally built a diverse Advisory Board to ensure our product serves the entire legal community. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Anything else you’d like us to know? We are not just a software company; we are building the settlement infrastructure of the future. Beyond our direct users, we are actively pursuing pilots with major court systems to deploy StreamSettle as a docket-clearing solution. By identifying settleable cases before they consume judicial resources, we aim to drastically reduce the overwhelming backlogs that paralyze our courts, freeing up judges to focus on complex litigation. Our true mission is to reduce the human toll of the process. By removing adversarial friction from routine claims, we allow injured parties to receive fair compensation months faster. We are live, generating revenue, and executing a density strategy that is proving the model works. We would be honored to showcase this at the ABA TECHSHOW. Company Name Trailmate Elevator Pitch Trailmate is the first client-facing AI agent built for law firms – a digital employee designed to handle client-facing work end to end. Lawyers tell Trailmate what they need done (run intake, collect documents, gather discovery responses, give case updates, etc.), and Trailmate turns that request into action – contacting clients and following up autonomously until the task is complete. Firms supervise progress and results in real time, without chasing clients or adding staff. What makes your company unique or innovative? Trailmate is unique because it is not just a chatbot or workflow tool. It is an outward-facing digital employee that actually engages clients autonomously. Lawyers delegate an objective in plain English, and Trailmate autonomously contacts clients, conducts structured conversations, follows up until tasks are complete, validates the results, and escalates only when human judgment is needed. This “delegate and supervise” model creates a new category in legal tech: AI as a digital employee, not software. What problem does your product solve? Trailmate solves one of the most persistent and costly problems in law firms: client-facing work that requires constant chasing, follow-up, and coordination. Intake, document collection, discovery responses, status updates, and other routine communications are repetitive, often deadline-sensitive, and highly dependent on client responsiveness, yet they consume enormous staff time and routinely stall matters. Who are your competitors? Our closest points of comparison are Case Status and Hona, which are modern client communication and portal tools. However, these products are fundamentally passive: they surface information to clients but still rely on firm staff to drive follow-up, collect documents, and move matters forward. Trailmate operates in a different category. It is not a client portal or messaging layer. It is an outward-facing AI agent that executes client-facing work end to end. There is no direct equivalent to this “delegate and supervise” digital-employee model in the legal market today. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://vimeo.com/1152280813 When was the company founded? 2025-06-12. Where is the company located? Woodland Hills, Calif. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Small to medium size law firms with consumer clients (particularly plaintiff-side firms in areas like employment, personal injury, immigration, family law, and consumer law) What is the price of your product or service? Trailmate is sold as a subscription, priced based on the number of active matters and the volume of client-facing work handled by the AI agent. Contracts range from $1,000 per month to $5,000 per month or more, depending on the firm’s volume. Tell us more about your traction. Trailmate is currently in stealth, with a public launch scheduled for January 13, 2026. To date, we have several law firms actively piloting the platform and additional firms in the pipeline that have expressed strong interest and are queued for onboarding post-launch. We have been running Trailmate in production within my own firm, Frontier Law Center, as a design-partner environment. In that setting alone, Trailmate has already conducted 100+ hours of active client conversations, autonomously collected over 1,100 client documents, and completed more than 350 distinct client-facing tasks on behalf of the firm. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Over the next five years, Trailmate’s growth plan is centered on category creation, disciplined expansion, and deep integration into how law firms operate. We will begin by converting our current pilots into paying customers immediately following our January 2026 launch, while onboarding additional early adopters through founder-led sales and partnerships with legal-tech platforms. Shortly after launch, we plan to raise a pre-seed round to accelerate product development, integrations, and go-to-market execution. Trailmate has been fully bootstrapped to date, with product-market validation driven by real usage inside my own law firm. As a domain-expert founder and recognized thought leader in legal AI, I am well connected with both forward-thinking law firms and complementary legal-tech vendors. I plan to leverage these relationships, in addition to traditional advertising / marketing efforts. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. I was born in the Philippines and came to the U.S. when I was 3 (half Filipino) and my co-founder is Indian. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? Trailmate is committed to building a diverse and inclusive legal tech community by intentionally hiring with diversity in mind as we grow. We believe assembling a team with varied backgrounds and perspectives leads to better products, a broader worldview, and technology that serves a wider range of law firms and clients more effectively. Anything else you’d like us to know? I am a very early design partner with Eve. We were featured as one of the first law firms to coin the term “AI-Native Law Firm” – https://www.legaltech-talk.com/frontier-law-center-taps-eve-to-become-the-first-ai-native-law-firm/ Company Name TwinCounsel, Inc. Elevator Pitch TwinCounsel is an AI delegation platform for solo and small law firms. Our AI teammate lives in the lawyer’s inbox, automatically building case context from emails and attachments. Lawyers delegate tasks like drafting subpoenas or financial disclosures in plain English – just by replying to an email. Every fact is auditable with source citations. We’ve proven 90% time savings, cutting 90-minute tasks to nine minutes. What makes your company unique or innovative? We solve the context problem that blocks AI adoption in legal. Most legal AI tools are “bring-your-own-context” – they are blank slates that require manual input before they can help. TwinCounsel is different. We automatically build structured case knowledge from the lawyer’s inbox – extracting parties, timelines, facts, deadlines, and documents without any data entry. This organized case intelligence is what makes trusted AI delegation possible. Three differentiators: (1) Inbox-native – we live where lawyers already work, eliminating adoption friction; (2) Automatic case context – our system understands the matter before the lawyer asks for help; (3) Auditable outputs – every generated fact links back to its source, solving lawyers’ #1 trust barrier. What problem does your product solve? Solo lawyers lose over 60% of their day to administrative chaos. Critical case facts are buried across 50-300 emails per matter – scattered in threads, attachments, and forwarded documents. Before lawyers can do actual legal work, they’re forced to manually hunt, organize, and re-type information. This “context gap” causes missed facts, missed deadlines, malpractice exposure, and the painful reality of working 8 hours but billing for only 3. Existing tools don’t solve this. Practice management software requires manual data entry – it’s the source of administrative work, not the solution. Generic AI tools are “blank slates” that require lawyers to copy-paste sensitive client data and provide context for every task. Neither approach gives AI what it needs to actually help: deep, organized knowledge of the case. Who are your competitors? 1) Incumbent practice management systems: Clio, MyCase (reactive dashboards requiring manual data entry) 2) AI-native point solutions: CoCounsel (Thomson Reuters), Spellbook, Gavel Exec (bring-your-own-context tools with no systemic case knowledge) 3) Generic AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Claude (high-friction copy-paste workflows with confidentiality risks) Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://www.loom.com/share/525e13a6982848539308722214b7031d. When was the company founded? 2025-05-17. Where is the company located? San Jose, Calif. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Solo and small law firm attorneys (1-10 attorneys), initially focused on family law, criminal law, and estates/private client practices. What is the price of your product or service? TBD: Subscription fee, tiered by number of matters. Tell us more about your traction Pre-revenue, but we’ve validated the core thesis hands-on. We embedded ourselves for two months inside a San Jose family/criminal law firm, running a “Concierge MVP” where we manually did the work our software will automate. This proved three things: 1) We can build a 360-degree view of a case from email. By assembling context from scattered emails, attachments, and threads, we created the organized case knowledge that makes accurate AI outputs possible. 2) Context + AI done right = highly accurate work. With proper case context, our AI-generated drafts were more accurate than the firm’s paralegal – and verifiable back to source documents. 3) 90% time savings are real and repeatable. Financial disclosures dropped from 90 minutes to 9. Routine court filings from 60 minutes to 6. We’re now expanding our design partner program across practice areas (workflows): our original criminal/family law partner (subpoenas, financial disclosures), personal injury (demand letters), and estates (discovery responses). The workflows differ but the pattern holds – scattered inbox context transformed into accurate, cited drafts. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. Year 1: Win the beachhead. Convert design partners to paying customers, ship self-serve onboarding, and integrate with core tools lawyers already use (Clio, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365). Prove that we can turn inbox chaos into organized case intelligence that powers trusted AI delegation. Year 2: Expand across practice areas (family → criminal → estates → immigration → plaintiff PI) and scale to 500+ solo and small-firm users. Deepen integrations so TwinCounsel becomes the connective layer between a firm’s scattered tools—the AI that finally makes their existing software work together. Years 3-5: Become the AI orchestration layer for the small law firm ecosystem. Our structured case knowledge—automatically built from email, documents, and connected systems—becomes the foundation that powers increasingly autonomous workflows. We capture a meaningful share of the $60B legal support market by replacing manual administrative work with intelligent delegation. Have you received outside funding? Less than $1M in outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. Our founding team bridges three continents. Josh Dorward (CEO) is a dual U.S.-Taiwan citizen who spent the past year in Taiwan connecting with the local startup ecosystem; we’re building our core engineering team there. Kenji Hashimoto (CTO) holds triple citizenship – Japan, U.K. and U.S. – bringing a global perspective to our technical leadership. Together we combine Silicon Valley startup experience with deep ties to Asian engineering talent and international markets. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? As an early-stage company, we’re just beginning to engage with the legal tech community. Our approach to team-building is intentionally global – we’re hiring our founding engineering team in Taiwan rather than defaulting to Silicon Valley, bringing geographic and cultural diversity into legal tech from day one. As we grow, we’re committed to maintaining this global perspective in our hiring and community participation. Anything else you’d like us to know? We’re YC S17 alumni with a prior exit (Indivio acquired by Cloudinary). This is the same proven founding team reuniting with perfect founder-market fit: Josh brings legal domain expertise (licensed CA attorney, JD/MBA) plus AI product leadership (Cloudinary GM); Kenji brings 10+ years of automation/AI systems architecture. We’re not theorizing – we’ve validated workflows inside a real firm and proven 10x efficiency gains. Company Name LMI Network LLC Elevator Pitch In an online world where AI algorithms polarize and divide, ZODR (pronounced Zoe-D-R) promotes conflict resolution using AI to help mediators resolve legal disputes between parties. Since most mediators use Zoom, a tool that is also installed on millions of potential mediation parties’ devices, ZODR, through its Zoom integration, gives mediators 1 hub to manage their mediation cases, and after all parties’ give consent to the AI “listening in,” lets mediators get AI recommendations on how to resolve the dispute. What makes your company unique or innovative? ZODR differs from standard case management software and generic use of Zoom for mediation in three ways: What problem does your product solve? Since the shift to online dispute resolution (ODR) after the pandemic’s “zoom boom,” and the explosion of AI legal tools after the 2022 public launch of ChatGPT, conflict resolution professionals are still figuring out how to administer an online mediation practice that incorporates AI and scale it on the web in an era where physical borders no longer matter. While the digital world moves instantly, mediators and arbitrators still spend manual time incorporating AI, chasing emails, scheduling across time zones, and drafting routine settlement clauses from scratch, all as part of their workflow. This friction delays justice and limits the number of clients a professional can serve. ZODR presents an intuitive platform that incorporates optional AI into the mediation session, and helps the conflict resolution professional manage all their matters in kanban-style birds-eye views. Additionally, ZODR addresses the fragmented workflows of the past where sensitive case data is scattered across Zoom, email, and Word documents, creating security risks and breaking the mediator’s flow. ZODR brings order by helping mediators actively manage the lifecycle of the dispute from intake to signed agreement, all with the help of an AI co-mediator. Who are your competitors? Some competitioners in the ODR space include: ODR.com, ADRNotable, Immediation, Next Level Mediation. Demo Video URL (if you have one) https://youtu.be/BALex6b2FTk. When was the company founded? 2025-05-31. Where is the company located? Houston, Tex. Who is your target customer (small firm, large firm, law department, etc.)? Our primary users are private mediators, arbitrators, and boutique dispute resolution firms. Our secondary market includes court-annexed mediation programs and ombuds offices looking to streamline high-volume case management. What is the price of your product or service? $29.99 per seat per month after a 14-day free trial, but discounted on an annual basis and for larger organizations. Tell us more about your traction. Since evolving the “Instant Mediators” community into the LMI Professionals (pros.lminetwork.com) list of online mediators, we have a subscriber base that will be the first to experience ZODR alongside others who have signed up for the wait list. More data will be available soon as we make ZODR fully operational to the general public. Describe your plan for growing the company over the next five years. First, we are not starting from zero since ZODR is part of the LMI Network (lminetwork.com); We are looking to convert the existing user base of LMI “Professionals” (pros.lminetwork.com) (formerly InstantMediators.com). Additionally, we are leveraging the “Justice Sites” (justicesites.com) initiative (launching 2026) to bundle high-performance lawyer and mediator websites with a ZODR subscription. This creates a “sticky” ecosystem where a mediator’s marketing (website) and operations (ZODR) are unified so we can sell a complete “virtual practice” to online mediators. Lastly, we own the LMI Network YouTube channel (YouTube.com/@lminetwork) and podcast (lmipodcast.com), which provides an existing outlet for marketing ZODR features and capabilities in video format. The channel lets us host media content, engage with users, and deliver support tips via video on a ZODR videos playlist. By year 2, we plan to then expand from individual practitioners to small firms and court-annexed mediation programs or community mediation offices. We believe there’s a market for larger high-volume mediation organizations who want to develop their online dispute resolution presence and handle disputes at scale across multiple jurisdictions. This would be most advantageous to family and small claims mediation organizations. By year 3, we want to focus on growing internationally across several markets and expand in multiple languages. AI’s ability to translate/interpret conversations in real time lowers the costs once associated with multilingual dispute resolution. Now mediators around the world can use ZODR to mediate with residents who not only reside outside their jurisdictions, but who also speak a different language. ODR is a worldwide phenomenon because all societies have conflicts and most adults globally now have a full mediation office in their pockets called Zoom. ZODR leverages these 2 facts in order to promote access to justice. Have you received outside funding? No outside funding. Describe any ways in which your company’s leadership and/or workforce are diverse. ZODR is a minority-owned business, founded by a first-generation immigrant lawyer and mediator who believes in the American Dream. Mac Pierre-Louis’ cross-border perspective ensures the platform is designed for global jurisdictional compatibility and will drive the mission of democratizing access to justice by making dispute resolution accessible to anyone who can use Zoom for mediation. Describe any ways in which your company contributes to a more diverse and inclusive legal tech community? In addition to the above where ZODR is a minority-founded company led by a Black male attorney-mediator and first-generation American residing in Texas, ZODR has hired a Bangladesh-origin development firm, headquartered in Wyoming. This cross-border and diverse leadership ensures our product design avoids the “US-centric/English-only” bias often found in many legal tech. Additionally, we promote access to justice. ZODR is about lowering the cost of dispute resolution by helping mediators run and manage their practices online with the assistance of AI. Traditional litigation is expensive and intimidating; ZODR’s efficiency tools allow mediators to handle lower-value cases profitably. This indirectly empowers underserved communities—who can be encouraged to use Zoom for mediation since they often cannot afford to take time off work to travel to a physical courthouse. ZODR gives the mediator a platform to run and manage their Zoom mediation so that disputing parties can access justice from their mobile devices. Anything else you’d like us to know? While it’s great to disrupt industries and change paradigms to make products better and increase value, we are mindful that in the legal field, innovation will also be measured by how much chaos or stability the innovation brings. Therefore, ZODR is not trying to replace mediators or just outsource legal disputes to AI. ZODR brings the focus back to the human neutral in the middle by augmenting their skills so they can help other people. Human-based conflict resolution will remain the focus of our work.

US stock market crashes again today: Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq are down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 363.48 points (-0.73%) to 49,226.72, while the S&P 500 fell 0.39% and the Nasdaq slipped 0.44%. The main catalyst for today’s volatility was the December Consumer Price Index report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Headline inflation rose 0.3% month over month and 2.7% year over year, exactly in line with Wall Street forecasts.

Title: BlackRock to slash hundreds of jobs — latest Wall Street biz to kick off 2026 with firings

BlackRock is reportedly slashing hundreds of jobs across the company, making it the latest Wall Street giant to start the New Year with sweeping layoffs. The world’s largest asset manager plans to cut 250 jobs, or roughly 1% of its global headcount, across its investment and sales teams, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. It’s unclear when the layoffs may take place or what is the driving force behind them, though rival banks and asset managers have linked job cuts at their own businesses to restructuring, cost-cutting, artificial intelligence and economic uncertainty. CitiGroup is set to axe about 1,000 jobs this week and UBS Group AG is planning a round of layoffs this month, with another round later this year, according to Bloomberg. A BlackRock spokesperson cast the company’s layoffs as a bid to become more efficient. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg. “Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future.” Shares in the asset management firm – which recorded roughly $13.5 trillion in assets at the end of September – fell roughly 1% Tuesday. BlackRock declined to comment to The Post. The company, which has about 24,600 employees, led two rounds of layoffs last year, each time slashing roughly 1% of its workforce. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been looking to lead the company deeper into alternative investments. The firm closed a $12 billion acquisition of alternative credit manager HPS Investment Partners in July. Since then, it has been integrating new executives and readying a new range of funds for investors. In its 2026 investment outlook, BlackRock said it will focus on investment themes such as artificial intelligence, income and diversification. “The first is really what are the biggest growth opportunities in the market today,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s head of equity exchange-traded funds, told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” last week. “Where you have to get laser focused to try and find some of these targeted exposures, like artificial intelligence, that could do very well in this environment.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. The firm still sees artificial intelligence as a long-term, capital intensive investment cycle, and doesn’t believe it’s dying down anytime soon, Jacobs said. BlackRock is one of the few companies that offers specialized AI-focused funds, like its Tech Active ETF that has amassed more than $8 billion in assets. Income is another major focus this year because BlackRock expects the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates again, a move that would pressure yields on cash investments, Jacobs said. Diversification is the third focus in BlackRock’s annual report because investors are looking for new assets. “Where can you really get diversification for your portfolio?” he told CNBC. “Something that’s going to behave differently from stocks and bonds.” The company is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Title: 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry explains why he's betting against Nvidia, not Meta or Microsoft

Every time Theron publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster. Nvidia is "simply the purest play," Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become "entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works," he continued. The investor of "The Big Short" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to "sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases." "Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted," Burry wrote. "So shorting it is cheap." Burry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's "pet." Nvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Burry said that betting against Meta would mean he was "also shorting its social media/advertising dominance," and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was "shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc." He added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to "shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath," referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel. Those Big Tech titans aren't "pure shorts on AI" and have staying power, Burry wrote. "They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings," he said. "But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout." On the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco. Burry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months. "I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making," he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and "ego" might be the driver. Burry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie "The Big Short." He wrote on Substack that "technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less." That echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns. Burry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to "have the exposure on the right side when the music stops." Burry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity. He pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required "massive upfront capital outlays," technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and "cutthroat price warfare" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals. "What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble," he wrote. Burry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI "might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability," but could ultimately prove "more dangerous than anything." He also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly. "I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup," Burry said. Jump to

Title: Franklin Templeton retrofits money market funds for tokenized stablecoin market
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/franklin-templeton-money-market-funds-stablecoin-reserves
Time Published: 2026-01-13T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Franklin Templeton is amending institutional money market funds to support stablecoin reserves and onchain cash use without launching new crypto-native products. Cointelegraph in your social feed Franklin Templeton has amended two Western Asset institutional money market funds (MMFs) to plug directly into the emerging US stablecoin regime and tokenized cash infrastructure rather than launching new crypto native products. According to a release shared with Cointelegraph, Franklin Templeton is adapting the two long‑running Western Asset institutional funds so they can be used more directly in US GENIUS‑aligned stablecoin reserve structures and blockchain‑enabled distribution channels, without changing their status as Securities and Exchange Commission‑registered 2a‑7 MMFs. The changes are designed to allow the funds to serve as regulated, government-backed collateral for payment stablecoins and other tokenized cash uses without altering their core regulatory status. ​Franklin Templeton’s Western Asset Institutional Treasury Obligations Fund (LUIXX) invests exclusively in short‑term US government obligations and is structured to be compatible with GENIUS Act reserve requirements, positioning it as plug‑and‑play infrastructure for payment stablecoin treasuries and bank‑style issuers that need SEC‑registered, government‑only collateral. Its Western Asset Institutional Treasury Reserves Fund (DIGXX), on the other hand, has added a blockchain‑enabled “Digital Institutional” share class on top of its existing 2a‑7 structure, intended to make it usable as 24/7, onchain collateral and cash management for tokenization platforms, custodians and broker‑dealers that want digital rails without moving into an unregistered vehicle. Related: XRP jumps 8% as Franklin Templeton, Grayscale ETFs begin trading Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, told Cointelegraph that the company expects stablecoin reserves to be managed “in both tokenized and more traditional form,” and sees room for both exclusive and multi‑manager mandates as more financial institutions launch their own tokens. He said that several “significant products in the stablecoin market” are “backed by traditional high-quality short-term issuance through non-digitally native product structures,” including the recently launched FRNT stablecoin in the State of Wyoming, and the company sees opportunities to help such partners through its investment management expertise. Franklin Templeton’s role, he said, is to manage reserves “in the product model [clients] prefer,” whether via bespoke portfolios or open‑end mutual funds. Bayston cast the amendments as incremental rather than experimental, noting that Western Asset’s institutional Treasury fund only needed “relatively minor adjustments” to sit inside the GENIUS framework and complement Franklin Templeton’s existing onchain products. In his view, many large clients still want familiar, SEC‑registered 2a‑7 wrappers as they plug into onchain distribution and collateral systems, so the company is extending a digital stack across a broader liquidity “suite” instead of forcing migration to new vehicles. Related: Franklin Templeton expands Benji tokenization platform to Canton Network ​Rather than tying the new digital share class to a single collateral or tokenization platform, Franklin Templeton plans to support access through multiple “trusted partners” as banks, broker‑dealers and other intermediaries roll out their own blockchain‑enabled frontends. Franklin Templeton is not alone in repositioning money funds for stablecoin reserves under the GENIUS Act. BlackRock announced plans to modify a Treasury money market fund in October 2025, aimed at serving as an authorized reserve asset for US stablecoin issuers, tightening its investment mandate to short‑dated Treasurys and overnight repo (short‑term, secured funding), to align with the new federal framework. BlackRock was already managing a bespoke government MMF for Circle’s USDC reserves, as large asset managers increasingly see regulated cash funds as backend rails for tokenized dollars rather than purely retail cash products.

Stock futures are lower this morning as investors digest earnings reports and await key inflation data; JPMorgan's fourth-quarter results were mixed, as profits and net interest income topped estimates while revenue fell short; consumer price data for December is due out this morning; Delta shares are falling after the airline issued a disappointing outlook; and President Trump is threatening Iran's trading partners with new tariffs over the country's response to recent protests. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are slightly lower as the quarterly earnings season gets underway and investors prepare for the release of inflation data that will be closely monitored by the Federal Reserve. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, each of which closed at record highs on Monday, were down 0.2% recently, while Nasdaq futures slipped 0.3%. Stocks came under pressure early Monday on news that the Department of Justice is investigating Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but rebounded to finish the day slightly higher. Gold futures were down 0.6% at $4,590 an ounce this morning, after hitting a record high around $4,640 on Monday amid concerns about possible threats to the Fed's independence. Crude oil futures were up 1.7% at $60.50 per barrel, trading above $60 for the first time since early December. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked higher to 4.20%, near its highest level in four months. Bitcoin was at $92,000. up from an overnight low of just below $91,000. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the world's largest bank by market capitalization, kicked off a busy week of bank earnings this morning. The bank reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.23 on revenue of $45.8 billion. Analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha had projected adjusted EPS of $4.96 and revenue of $46.07 billion. JPMorgan reported $25.1 billion in net interest income, above what analysts had forecast. "The U.S. economy has remained resilient," CEO Jamie Dimon said. "While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening. Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy." Bank stocks sank on Monday after President Donald Trump suggested a cap of 10% on credit card interest rates. During the earnings call this morning, JPMorgan executives are likely to discuss that, as well as a deal announced last week to take over as the backer of Apple's (AAPL) credit card program from Goldman Sachs (GS). JPMorgan shares were little changed in recent premarket trading, after falling more than 1% Monday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release its closely followed Consumer Price Index report at 8:30 a.m ET. Economists on average expect the report to show that consumer prices rose 2.7% in the 12 months through December, unchanged from the month before. "Core" prices, excluding more volatile food and gas prices, are also expected to have risen 2.8%, which would mark an acceleration in inflation after it unexpectedly slowed in November. Inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, and continued signs of price pressures could keep the central bank from cutting its key interest rate again soon. Inflation is generally expected to slow this year as declining housing costs and a lack of wage increases are projected to outweigh the impact of the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs. Delta Air Lines (DAL) stock is slumping in premarket trading after the airline issued a disappointing outlook. Delta said it earned an adjusted $1.55 in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, while revenue topped estimates at $16 billion. For 2026, however, Delta said it is expecting adjusted EPS of $6.50 to $7.50, with the midpoint of $7.00 well below the $7.26 analysts currently forecast. Analysts had said leading into the report that Delta and other airlines may opt for more cautious outlooks for 2026 after a difficult last few years of operations, and said that the 2026 forecasts will likely be the focus of airline earnings this month rather than the fourth-quarter results. In Tuesday's report, Delta also announced an order of 30 planes from Boeing, the widebody 787-10, with options to purchase another 30, with deliveries expected to start in 2031. Delta shares were down more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. President Trump threatened a new round of tariffs amid the deadly protests in Iran. "Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America," Trump said Monday afternoon on social media. The larger structure of the tariffs are currently unknown, as the White House has yet to release an official order on the tariffs. The tariffs would be in response to a recent wave of anti-government protests in Iran, which has led to the deaths of more than 600 protestors, human rights groups estimate. Trump has threatened to involve the U.S. military if the killings continue, and has encouraged the protests to topple Iran's government, per CNBC. The legality of Trump's current tariffs are also unknown, with a Supreme Court ruling expected in the coming weeks over whether the president had the legal authority to unilaterally declare the tariffs.

Investing Stocks that plunged on the open on the Federal Reserve subpoena news reversed sharply and ended higher across the board by the close. Fourth-quarter earnings will kick off with the big Wall Street banks reporting this week With some spicy economic news on tap, like today’s December Consumer Price Index print, which is expected to be 2.7% year-over-year, it could move markets. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images The futures are trending higher after the December consumer price index came in at 2.7%, which matched Wall Street expectations. The reversal in the futures comes after a wild Monday that saw stocks get hammered on the open, amid news of Department of Justice subpoenas sent to Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell regarding his testimony to Congress last summer. Initially, all the major indices plunged on the news, then reversed sharply to finish higher on the day. Both the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed up 0.17% at 49,590, and the S&P 500, which ended the day higher by 0.16% at 6,977, once again printed new all-time highs as the January strength continues. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last seen at 23,833, up 0.25%, and the Russel 2000 continued its red-hot start to the year, closing at 2,635, up 0.44%. The R2K is leading all the major indices in 2026, up 5.7% on the year. Wall Street is now looking forward to the start of the fourth-quarter earnings, with the big money-center banks reporting later this week. Yields were higher across the entire Treasury curve on Monday, and you can bet that the controversy with the Federal Reserve receiving subpoenas was a big reason for the selling. The uncertainty about Fed independence and the potential for government intervention pushed bond prices down, echoing past “Sell America” events in 2025. The reality is this will likely blow over quickly, as a mountain of economic news and the start of earnings season will redirect attention. The 30-year bond closed at 4.84%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%. Prices were higher across the energy complex on Monday as geopolitical tensions in multiple regions around the globe and the potential for long-term changes to the global oil supply drove crude oil prices higher, with the WTI and Brent benchmarks both climbing. Brent Crude closed trading on Monday at $64.01, up 1.06%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the session at $59.63, up 0.85%. Natural gas stormed back after a wave of frigid weather swept across a large swath of the U.S. Monday, closing up 6.5% at $3.38. In what seems like a never-ending story, Gold closed Monday at $4,596, up another 1.94%. Wall Street’s $5,000 price targets for the precious metal could arrive much sooner than expected. The combination of numerous geopolitical hotspots and Federal Reserve news once again provided the stiff tailwind that has been present for well over a year. Silver also bolted higher on Monday, climbing a massive 6.6% to close trading at $85.14. Wall Street’s $100 price targets are getting closer by the week, and with most rebalancing finished, the path for Silver looks higher. The crypto market traded range-bound and sideways on Monday, influenced by a “risk-off” environment, much like other asset classes, driven by rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, including the escalating dispute between the Trump administration and Federal Reserve Chair Powell. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $92,010, while Ethereum was posted at $3, 131. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

UPDATED 08:00 EST / JANUARY 13 2026 by Duncan Riley Cybersecurity and data protection company Acronis International GmbH today announced the launch of Archival Storage, a data storage and protection solution designed for managed service providers and their small to medium-sized business customers. Pitched as offering long-term, compliant and cost-efficient data storage and protection, Acronis Archival Storage allows users to retain large amounts of data securely, affordably and with fast accessibility when it matters most. Acronis Archival Storage has been built for compliance-driven and data-heavy environments and allows users to store infrequently accessed data with Amazon Web Services Inc. S3-compatible object storage, integrated directly into Acronis’ unified billing and management system. The company says the solution offers the reliability, durability and predictable pricing model MSPs need to meet customer demands and long-term retention requirements. “For many customers, regulations and industry best practices require data to be retained for years,” said President Gaidar Magdanurov. “With Acronis Archival Storage, MSPs can now provide their clients with long-term storage built for compliance readiness, cost predictability and ease of use.” Key features and benefits include S3-compatible object storage integrated with Acronis’ unified billing and management system to allow MSPs to manage archival data alongside other services from a single platform. The service delivers millisecond-level data retrieval with 11×9 durability and 99.5% availability, complemented with built-in encryption and write-once, read-many immutability that helps ensure data integrity and support regulatory compliance. The offering is designed to provide predictable total cost of ownership, with no egress or application programming interface fees to eliminate unexpected cloud charges and to complement existing warm backup storage in regulated environments. Acronis Archival Storage also emphasizes ease of deployment and ongoing management through preconfigured plans, S3 API support and integrated controls and is supported by seven globally distributed data centers to improve connectivity and meet regional compliance requirements. For MSPs, Acronis says, the new solution represents a new way to differentiate their offerings and build predictable margins through integrated billing and zero egress costs. By combining archival capabilities with Acronis’ robust cyber protection ecosystem, it says, service providers can deliver end-to-end data management that scales across customer needs, now with a cold storage tier. Based in Switzerland, Acronis is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $658 million over four rounds, including $147 million in 2019 and $250 million on a valuation north of $2.5 billion in 2021. Investors in the company include BlackRock Inc., CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Insight Partners LP. In August 2024, it was announced that Swedish investment firm EQT was acquiring a majority stake in Acronis. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Davos to begin new era with global order shaken by Trump
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2026/0113/1552872-davos-begins-new-era-with-global-order-shaken-by-trump/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T12:56:44Z
Full Content:
Business and political elites head to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos next week with its vision of a rules-based global economic order being tested to the limits. US President Donald Trump's expected appearance in the Swiss mountain resort highlights the gap between his agenda and the consensus-driven approach of the WEF, which has faced enduring criticism that it is a talking shop of the rich. His "America First" policy has led to trade tariffs being used as punishment, military intervention in Venezuela, the threat of taking over Greenland by force and a US retreat from cooperation on climate, health and other global challenges. The Trump administration has also threatened Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with a criminal indictment, prompting many top central bankers to issue a statement defending him and central bank independence. Dubbing its 56th edition "A Spirit of Dialogue", the WEF's leaders say that given the current uncertainty, getting together to map out a way forward in business and politics is crucial. "Dialogue is not a luxury, it is a necessity," said WEF president and CEO Borge Brende, a former Norwegian minister. But others say that with the US and China leveraging power to suit national interests, the WEF risks obsolescence. "Who is going to be making the case for the rules-based international order?" said Daniel Woker, a former Swiss ambassador and foreign relations expert. "To be very blunt, in a system where everyone is only looking out for themselves, it has no reason to exist. It's an event from the past." Davos-watchers are also looking at whether the event has lost impetus since its 87-year-old founder Klaus Schwab stepped down as chair in April. The Geneva-based organisation said in August an internal investigation had found no evidence of material wrongdoing by Schwab, after a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. It named BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs. The latest forum has much to discuss, from how to handle Trump's version of the Monroe Doctrine establishing US supremacy in the Western hemisphere, to the ways artificial intelligence is changing the world. It comes just after one of Switzerland's worst modern tragedies, a ski resort bar fire that killed 40 people. In pre-event briefings, the WEF has put a brave face on the global tumult, highlighting how companies have sought to adapt to the highest U.S. tariff rates since the Great Depression and pointing to an easing of trade tensions in late 2025. Still, a WEF survey of executives released last week showed that doing business got harder in 2025. The poll also painted a downbeat picture of cooperation on peace and security. With several European leaders expected to attend, eyes will be on how they respond to US challenges, including Trump's threats to take over Greenland, and attacks on European efforts to regulate American tech firms. "The politicians need to stand strong," said Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of the UNI Global Union representing 20 million service-sector workers worldwide, urging policymakers to address how AI and new technologies impact jobs. One feature of this year's WEF meeting will be top oil executives eager to hear Trump promoting his energy dominance agenda, which encourages them to drill for more oil and gas while snubbing alternatives like wind and solar. The CEOs of Exxon Mobil, Shell, TotalEnergies, Equinor and ENI are all expected after much more sporadic attendance in past years, when oil players saw the forum as anti-fossil fuel. It remains to be seen whether China, which in recent years has sent top officials, will field a sizeable Davos presence. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2026.

LAST UPDATE | 13 Jan IRISH DIPLOMATS HAVE postponed an accreditation ceremony for the new Iranian ambassador to Ireland in response to the deaths of pro-democracy protestors. Iran has an embassy in Blackrock in Dublin and its new chief diplomat, Eshagh Al Habib, was due to go to Áras an Uachtaráin for a ceremony to accept his credentials. This has been postponed, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, in response to the deaths and injuries of people killed in protests and the shutting down of the internet and phones in the country by the regime. Speaking to reporters in Egypt today during a tour of the Middle East, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee said she didn’t think “it was appropriate” for the ceremony to proceed today. “We’re appalled and I’m appalled by what’s happening in Iran, and I don’t think it was appropriate for that to proceed today,” she said. “We need to keep diplomatic ties open, and we will, but I think it was the right thing to do today.” Iran has been gripped by pro-democracy protests in recent weeks – hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in the uprising against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s rule. Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said it had confirmed 734 people killed during the protests, including nine minors, but warned the death toll was likely far higher. The protests in Iran began in late December over the ailing economy and have transformed into the most significant challenge to the regime for several years. McEntee said today there is a small Irish team on the ground in Iran. “We’re engaged with them on a regular basis,” she said, adding that contact between the team and the Department of Foreign Affairs is “very difficult” due to communications restrictions in Iran. “I don’t fear for their safety, but we do need to keep in contact with them,” she said. Advertisement Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin condemned the regime’s attacks on protestors and said the violence in Iran “must stop”. “I strongly condemn the brutal and violent suppression of protestors that has left hundreds of civilians dead in Iran over recent days,” he said in a statement on X. “The people of Iran have a fundamental right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression. The repression must end. I urge the authorities in Tehran to uphold the rights of all their citizens. “The violence must stop, the curtailing of basic freedoms must end, and dialogue begin at once.” On Sunday, McEntee said she was “deeply concerned” by developments in Iran. This morning the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed the postponement of the formal ceremony to welcome the new ambassador. “The decision to postpone the ceremony of credentials for the Ambassador-designate of the Islamic Republic of Iran was taken in light of protests in Iran in recent days which have seen very significant numbers of Iranians killed or injured and a communications blackout,” a spokeswoman said. In a statement yesterday, the Iranian regime’s embassy in Dublin has claimed the Tehran Government is open to dialogue, committed to human rights and “peaceful assembly”. The Journal has requested a statement from the Iranian embassy in regard to today’s development. UK Diplomatic measures have also been taken in the UK, with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper telling the House of Commons today that her department had summoned the Iranian ambassador. Cooper said she had spoken to the Iranian foreign minister yesterday, “setting out the UK’s total abhorrence of the killings, the violence, and the repression that we are seeing”. The Foreign Secretary said: “Today, as the further reports have come through, the minister for the Middle East (Hamish Falconer) at my instruction has summoned the Iranian ambassador to underline the gravity of this moment, and to call Iran to answer for the horrific reports that we are hearing.” With additional reporting from Eimer McAuley Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: 9 marketing predictions for 2026 as AI fuels polarity
URL: https://www.marketingdive.com/news/marketing-predictions-for-2026/809124/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T09:31:00Z

Let Marketing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The sense of a stable middle ground is eroding across an industry at a point of contraction, with many displaying mixed feelings about marketing’s future. The sense of a stable middle ground will continue to erode across several aspects of marketing in 2026. Studies indicate the middle class is thinning, altering important consumer milestones. Monoculture is also on the wane as people spend more time engaged with algorithms hypertailored to their interests. On the industry front, marketing services are gravitating toward two polarities in the wake of historic consolidation: White-glove models and plug-and-play ones built around artificial intelligence. Feeling some of the most pain from these developments are the employees who make the industry hum but are facing a grim job market. “There has been a rampant uptick in the past few years of putting the focus on shareholder value,” said Dustin Black, executive creative director at Preston Spire. “Culturally, the difference between decision-makers and makers has never been greater.” The advancement of generative AI could encourage mediocrity — “slop” was deemed a 2025 word of the year for a reason — but also benefit marketers moving against the grain. To grab attention, brands may embrace messaging that is deliberately button-pushing or bold. “A lot of the output is trending toward the median,” said Taryn Crouthers, CEO of Spcshp, about AI in marketing. “It’s about pulling against the median because all of the content is merging to look very, very similar.” Others could step up investment in emergent channels to reach audiences with growing economic influence, including Gen Alpha. There will be no shortage of stages to test these tactics, with a Super Bowl, Olympics and FIFA World Cup on deck. Below, Marketing Dive shares nine predictions for an industry at a point of contraction and displaying mixed feelings about its future. Omnicom’s acquisition of Interpublic Group signals more agency consolidation coming down the pike, experts say. As rumors swirl around additional breakups and sell-offs, a new chapter is on the horizon for ad-holding groups. “It’s absolutely signifying a shift towards media and technology scale as key foundational elements for what the legacy holding companies will reorganize around,” said Jay Pattisall, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, of the Omnicom-IPG deal. Dealmaking activity could be enabled by further interest rate cuts and a light-touch regulatory environment. Other agencies may broker richer strategic partnerships: For example, Publicis kicked off 2026 by striking a pact with LiveRamp, underpinning the significance of data in the AI arms race, Ad Age reported. Massive layoffs and the death of iconic creative shops — not to mention the likelihood of future cost-cutting measures — have been painful but also mean that an army of talent is seeking its next venture. “You might see a lot of these former executives trying to start their own firms playing to the more niche side of the marketplace,” said Paul Hardart, a clinical professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Independents meanwhile may pursue different routes to expansion. ZMC-backed Wpromote’s purchase of Giant Spoon in late 2025 speaks to the role private equity is playing in the formation of “big indies” that could appeal to deep-pocketed brands. “Not tomorrow, not next month, but in the not-so-distant future, there are going to be more options for enterprise marketers to choose from as a result of the private-equity investments in what we historically call independent digital agencies,” said Pattisall. Brands will further push the limits of AI-generated creative in 2026, with football’s big night acting as a key litmus test. Svedka already announced it will run a Super Bowl spot made with AI, but the spirits maker won’t be the only advertiser putting on an AI showcase. “I would say, more likely than not, 50% of all Super Bowl spots we watch this year will utilize generative AI in some facet,” said Chris Neff, chief AI officer at Anomaly, noting that those applications could be in pre-production and not immediately apparent on screen. While the AI content spigot is flowing, marketers will explore different messaging avenues. Brands, including Equinox and Dollar Shave Club, have recently launched campaigns that prod at the backlash to AI slop while still leveraging generative AI tools. However, many continue to underestimate strong consumer aversion. “Rushing into anything — over doing things to that extent — is a mistake,” said Sean Cassidy, CEO of PR firm DKC. “One thing that humans seem to still possess...is a pretty good B.S. detector.” Trepidation around AI extends into other areas, even as the technology becomes institutionalized at brands and agencies. Artificially inflated engagement may create a negative feedback loop for advertisers that are only investing more in social and digital, contributing to the Dead Internet Theory. “The bot traffic is going to increase. Is that going to make the metrics even better? Is that going to be the catalyst for this vicious cycle for it to get worse and worse and worse?” said Neff. “It's very hard to know exactly what’s real and not.” “[Brands are] playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” Bill Bruno CEO of Celebrus Advertisers, agencies and other stakeholders have spent years shoring up their land grabs in the data-driven marketing ecosystem to fuel developments like programmatic advertising and help gird against the shift from identifiers like third-party cookies. That rush for data will continue to intensify amid the rise and operationalization of AI-driven advertising, giving marketers a chance to learn and apply the lessons of previous eras. Data transparency and ownership will be key as AI complicates challenges that marketers already face around ad visibility and efficacy, especially amid the rise of zero-click search and AI-powered bots and agents that could muddy measurement waters. “You've got a lot of brands… that are basically using terms like ‘AI readiness’ that don't know what they need or what they're going to do, necessarily,” explained Bill Bruno, CEO of data firm Celebrus. “I don't think a lot of people are thinking two or three steps ahead right now. They're playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” To have a better handle on data, marketers can shift focus from collecting data to connecting it via tools like consumer data platforms and data fabric environments that give a more unified view of consumers, several experts said. That can help marketers focus on exactly what they need, rather than getting washed away in a flood of data. “My clients who have been most successful are focusing on marketing-specific use-case data readiness,” said Nicole Greene, vice president, analyst at Gartner. “Do we really know what our customers want? Can we safeguard the data that they have entrusted us with, and as a result, can we do marketing and advertising better?” "I don’t think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women... It’s more being true to what the company and what the audience is." Adam Singer Vice president of marketing at AdQuick Some of last year’s boldest advertising featured good jeans, spicy plumbers, the best car to have sex in and a full bush summer. Similarly edgy ad creative could return to the fore as marketers look to break through in an increasingly fragmented and frantic media landscape. While those campaigns relied on — and often parodied — “sex sells” tropes, their success speaks more to their ability to break through an ad landscape that has grown increasingly stale and bland, even before the rise of AI, said Adam Singer, vice president of marketing at AdQuick. “Companies have become really risk averse. I think consumers are really thirsty for brands to do things that are interesting,” Singer said. However, being bold doesn’t mean that brands must turn back the clock and revive aesthetics and attitudes that have largely fallen by the cultural wayside. “I don't think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women or even necessarily really attractive celebrities, although celebrities definitely push product,” Singer said. “It's more being true to what the company and what the audience is.” Marketers can bring this type of authenticity to life in several ways, from emotional messages to simply portraying their products with beautiful photography and videography — as long as the company is authentic to its core values. Last year’s Cracker Barrel rebrand fiasco is an example of what not to do. “Everyone tried to make that a political thing and say it was ‘woke,’ but I don't think that's really what was going on,” Singer said. “We've seen companies flattening everything, making everything a little bit more boring, and people are tired of that. They want brands to do big, bold things.” Marketers should prepare for further consolidation in an ad-tech industry that has reached maturity but continues to evolve alongside technological change. “At different areas in the ecosystem, there is a consolidation of the media activation between DSPs and SSPs — most of them are starting to compete with each other and not just partner with each other anymore,” said Mathieu Roche, CEO of identity firm ID5. In the DSP space, Amazon and Walmart continue to develop their offerings, while Microsoft’s sunsetting of Xandr provided a boost to Amazon via a transition partnership. Some brands have looked to test different sell-side workflows, including marketplace deals and guaranteed programmatic buys, especially as more connected TV inventory comes on board, said LiveRamp’s Travis Clinger. Consolidation could benefit brands and publishers as it reduces fees and the costs of operating, but the reduction of consumer choice has caused the space to face antitrust issues. Google is expected to learn the fate of its ad-tech antitrust case this year, and while it appears that it will not face more dramatic structural remedies, any decision could cause a surge in ad-tech M&A, explained Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Forrester. “Google's competitors aren't going to let an opportunity pass them by to take advantage of any weakening of Google's position in the ad tech market,” Mitchell-Wolf said. “I do anticipate the rest of the ad tech market trying to shore up their offerings, just to prepare and posture themselves to have the maximally enticing place to land for any advertisers or publishers that take a look at what Google is offering on the tail end of this.” Though the oldest members of Gen Alpha will be turning only 16 in 2026, the generation is already making waves. The cohort already wields $28 billion in direct spending power, and its influence can be seen within the marketing strategies of brands ranging from Lowe’s to Hi-Chew. In 2026, advertiser interest in Gen Alpha, or those born between 2010 and 2024, will become more concrete, according to GWI Chief Operating Officer Misha Williams. “Thinking about [Gen Alpha] in terms of an afterthought or a demographic not to be considered when you are shaping your brand positioning … is a mistake,” said Williams. While the older end of Gen Alpha is beginning to make purchases for themselves, the cohort holds significant sway over purchases made by their parents and has already established awareness for hundreds of brands. The group is also being raised in the age of social media algorithms and AI, priming them to expect deeper personalization from brands compared to previous generations, Williams explained. “With access to information, people become more aware of what they like, what they don’t like,” Williams said. “So when you’re talking about Gen Alpha and the fact that they’re so young, a critical mistake is to treat them as such.” Brands targeting Gen Alpha should expect media consumption behavior that’s even more fragmented than their Gen Z predecessors, Williams said. The cohort is also more inclined to lean on their social connections to validate whether or not a brand or product aligns with their lifestyle, making it critical for marketers to find an authentic value proposition. “What you’re putting in front of them, from an advertising and marketing perspective, must be authentic,” Williams said. “It has to resonate with them contextually.” "It’s not like marketing was ever an easy job. It just became even more difficult." Dipanjan Chatterjee Vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Social media and creator-led marketing surged in 2025 as giants like PepsiCo and Unilever evolved how they work with agencies and dramatically boosted their investments, a signal of the growing role both channels play in shaping culture. Interest is expected to grow in 2026, with creator ad spend in the U.S. forecast to climb 18% year over year, per the IAB. The bet is a signal that marketers have begun to value community over reach, according to Movers+Shakers Chief Creative Officer Geoffrey Goldberg. Brands will likely direct much of their budgets to smaller creators this year, Goldberg forecasts, noting that AI could help streamline the process by helping marketers scale content volume and better understand target audiences. However, category interest is bound to emphasize growing pains. For example, a rise in AI content on social feeds will likely pressure creators to strengthen their creative muscles to cut through the noise. “Already, the amplification of content and the different styles of content has upped so much because of AI … there’s a lot more people in the playing field,” Goldberg said. “The algorithms are still prioritizing great content, it’s prioritizing that over followers.” A surge in content could see both social media teams and consumers faced with burnout as more brands opt for always-on strategies. Broadly, as social media becomes a more foundational aspect of marketers’ playbooks, concerns around a lack of measurement standardization will only grow, a challenge Goldberg recommends brands approach by prioritizing metrics that prove engagement. “In order for [social] to really be their operating system, we need to be really clear on how we measure success and there’s no singular, clear metric,” Goldberg said. Sports marketing will be a major avenue for marketers looking to reach consumers in an increasingly fractured advertising landscape in 2026. Major events such as the FIFA World Cup and 2026 Winter Olympic Games will deliver captive linear TV audiences while emerging sports and leagues create avenues for marketers to connect with more niche, but growing, consumer groups. “One of the things we're seeing is a really incredible momentum behind a lot of small, micro leagues from a familiarity perspective. They’re not super well known yet, but of the people who are aware of them, they have just incredible momentum. They're personally relevant, culturally relevant. They're really sort of poised to take off,” said Jennifer Musil, global president of research at The Harris Poll. Women’s sports will continue to gain momentum in 2026, especially as more niche sports and leagues become more popular. For example, upstart women’s basketball league Unrivaled signed Maker’s Mark, a Beam Suntory Brand, as its first-ever official spirits partner in December. Women’s sports leagues give small and large brands alike an opportunity to get in early as audiences continue to grow. “Seven of the top 10 leagues in the last data set we looked at from a momentum perspective, are female leagues. So women's sports still has a ton of momentum behind it. It's not done growing yet,” said Musil. Tariffs chaos and confusion will not be left behind in 2025, but will continue to cause issues for marketers and consumers alike in 2026. Economic concerns, such as increased cost of living and inflation, may only exacerbate the issue. While the advertising industry has remained remarkably resilient in the face of tariffs and global ad revenue is expected to climb 8.8% in 2026, the Trump administration’s approach to international trade is expected to still create stress for adland. The on-and-off-again nature of tariffs and the steady rise in prices of imported goods makes it difficult for consumers to create and stick to a budget, which may translate to less discretionary spending. “CMOs are marketing to the end consumer. What is going on with tariffs is exceptionally chaotic because it makes it impossible for consumers to be able to plan their own budgets…because there is complete turbulence as it relates to tariffs," said Mike Proulx, vice president, research director, Forrester. Ultimately, marketers will have to adapt their strategies to better handle uncertainty. This could mean shorter campaigns and quicker turnaround times and an increased focus on value. As consumers tighten their purse strings, putting an emphasis on value and deals could help mitigate some of the chaos of the current economic landscape. This was already a major focus for advertisers in 2025 and could continue to be a viable strategy for 2026. “Over the last couple of years, marketers have gotten used to planning in an environment of considerable volatility. In reality, you can't plan for anything, yet you have to plan,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president, principal analyst, Forrester. “It's not like marketing was ever an easy job. It just became even more difficult.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Planning around tariff disruption echoes the pandemic, a moment the industry did not always meet with agility or savvy investment decisions.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo LONDON, Jan 13 : BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, still believes in the investment case for artificial intelligence in the year ahead but will be focusing on broader opportunities, it said on Tuesday. Investors seeking to play the AI theme into 2026 favour energy and infrastructure providers over Wall Street big tech, BlackRock said in its Investment Directions report, citing a recent investor survey it conducted. AI and big tech dominated markets and world equity returns in 2025, but as the multitrillion-dollar race between the likes of Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet to build new data centres generates worries about uncertain returns on capital and higher borrowing, investors were looking for new ideas, the BlackRock survey showed. Among the 732 companies in BlackRock's survey of clients based in the EMEA region, only a fifth said that the largest U.S. tech groups represented the most compelling investment opportunity in AI.

Title: Layoffs news: Meta, BlackRock, Citigroup to fire hundreds of employees — and it's just the first month of 2026

Layoffs in 2026: At least three large companies have announced mass layoffs in the recent days, and January is not even over yet. The job loss trend that gripped 2025 seems to have entered 2026 too — at least for now — with giants like Meta, Citi Group and BlackRock laying off thousands of staff across roles. The BlackRock layoffs were the most recent job cuts announced by a major company in this month, with the firm announcing that it will let go hundreds of employees. Here is a list of major companies across the world that have announced layoffs in 2026 — Mark Zuckerberg's Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in the company's Reality Labs sector as it plans to restructure to put more money into AI, Bloomberg reported. As per the report quoting a person familiar with the development, the Meta job cuts are expected later this week as the company wants to shift money away from some virtual reality products and into other AI wearables. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg had asked company executives to look for budget reductions within the Reality Labs. Banking major Citigroup is about to lay off around 1,000 employees this week as CEO Jane Fraser seeks to control costs and improve returns at the company. The Wall Street bank had around 227,000 employees at the end of September as per data shared by it. The latest round of layoffs at Citigroup comes as part of the company's plan announced two years ago to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, as per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know. “We will continue to reduce our headcount in 2026,” Citigroup said in a statement. “These changes reflect adjustments we’re making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs; efficiencies we have gained through technology; and progress against our transformation work,” it added. Under Fraser, who took over as CEO in 2021, Citigroup has seen a company-wide revamp where it exited much of its international retail business and restructured its core operations. BlackRock on Monday said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, becoming the latest Wall Street firm to announce job cuts. As per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know, the BlackRock layoffs will see around 1% of its workforce being let go, translating to around 250 employees across divisions. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority. Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future,” a BlackRock spokesperson was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. The move comes as the CEO of the world's largest asset management company pushes for alternative investments.

Title: Strategy Drops $1.25 Billion On Bitcoin Above $91,000

Bitcoin treasury company Strategy has continued its accumulation of the cryptocurrency, taking its holdings to 687,410 BTC with the latest purchase. As announced in an X post by Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, the company has completed a new Bitcoin acquisition involving 13,627 BTC, spending an average of $91,519 per token or a total of about $1.25 billion. This purchase is rather large; in fact, it’s the biggest buy that the firm has made since July of last year. In his usual Sunday foreshadowing post, Saylor hinted that the acquisition would be significant, using the caption: “₿ig Orange.” In a reply to the post, the Strategy chairman reflected on the company’s accumulation journey, saying, “Ironic that our $60.25 billion Bitcoin position started with a $0.25 billion purchase in August 2020.” Following the purchase announcement, Strategy’s stack has officially grown to 687,410 BTC and total investment to $51.80 billion. At present, these holdings are valued at $63.28 billion, meaning that the treasury company is in a profit of more than 22%. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the new acquisition took place in the week between January 5th and 11th, funded using proceeds from the company’s MSTR and STRC at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings. Last Monday, Strategy announced expansions for both its Bitcoin treasury and US Dollar reserve, but the focus this week appears to have been on the cryptocurrency alone. The USD reserve, which was created by the company at the start of December, has seen two additions so far, and the latest one took its value to $2.25 billion. In another X post, Saylor has also shared a chart that compares annualized returns for the best-performing assets in the “Bitcoin Standard Era,” referring to the period since August 2020 when the firm made its first purchase of the cryptocurrency. As displayed in the graph, MSTR has produced the second-most annualized returns in this timespan, with its profits of 60% surpassing even BTC’s, which has managed a return of 45%. The number one performing asset in the period has been Nvidia (NVDA), posting annual returns of 68%. The strength behind the company’s stock was initially driven by the Ethereum mining boom and more recently, by the rise of AI datacenters. “The best-performing assets of this decade are Digital Intelligence $NVDA, Digital Credit $MSTR, and Digital Capital $BTC,” Saylor wrote, framing each asset under a distinct role. Bitcoin kicked off 2026 with a recovery surge, but bullish momentum has faded for the asset as its price is still trading around $91,400. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: NCLA Asks D.C. Circuit to Affirm that Courts Can Hear Constitutional Cases on FTC Enforcement

January 12, 2026 20:55 ET | Source: New Civil Liberties Alliance New Civil Liberties Alliance Washington, DC, Jan. 12, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The New Civil Liberties Alliance filed an amicus curiae brief today in support of neither party urging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to affirm that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction to hear Media Matters for America v. Federal Trade Commission. NCLA does not take a position on the merits of Media Matters’s claims that the FTC investigation demanding internal information from the organization violates the First and Fourth Amendments. The district court issued a preliminary injunction that halted the investigation. NCLA addresses FTC’s insistence upon exclusively managing this dispute in its own internal adjudication system, which puts the agency in charge of deciding the question of its own powers and exclusively controls access to the courts for judicial review of that decision. The D.C. Circuit should reject FTC’s argument on this point, which flies in the face of NCLA’s hard-won Supreme Court victory in Michelle Cochran v. SEC (a/k/a Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC). NCLA persuaded the Supreme Court in April 2023 that our client Michelle Cochran and other Americans could bring constitutional challenges against government agencies like SEC in federal court before enduring allegedly unconstitutional administrative adjudications. Axon/Cochran unanimously overruled six circuit courts of appeal that had trapped parties subject to arbitrary or unconstitutional agency power, forcing them to languish indefinitely in years of administrative proceedings while enduring ongoing, here-and-now violations of their civil rights. The Justices specifically ruled that Axon Enterprise, Inc. and Michelle Cochran had the right to a district court hearing over FTC’s and SEC’s unconstitutional, biased and due-process-denying adjudication schemes. The Supreme Court had already decided this question as far back as 2010 in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a ruling that also unanimously recognized district courts’ statutory jurisdiction over such claims. More recently, the Supreme Court in SEC v. Jarkesy recognized Article III district court jurisdiction, including the right to a neutral adjudicator for agency prosecutions. These precedents mean Media Matters deserves its day in district court for its constitutional lawsuit against FTC, rather than being consigned to FTC’s internal tribunal which would delay judicial review until, as Justice Kagan wrote in Axon/Cochran, it would be “too late to be meaningful.” FTC argues that the district court lacks jurisdiction over the case because the agency claims the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 gives it authority to enforce its Civil Investigative Demands in court as part of cases it brings. But Media Matters brought this lawsuit, not FTC, and the agency has not yet and may not ever sue to enforce the CID against the organization in court. Moreover, FTC’s CID review procedure was established by regulation, not by any statute, so it cannot oust jurisdiction long conferred by Congress on district courts by statute. The mere existence of an in-house adjudication or CID enforcement scheme does not take away district court jurisdiction to hear claims that an agency has violated the Constitution. NCLA released the following statements: “Executive branch administrative agencies cannot pass regulations that purport to displace the judicial power from courts to the agency—especially not when the question is whether the agency itself has violated the Constitution! Such claims must be decided promptly and exclusively in the courts which alone have the power and duty to decide them.”— Peggy Little, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA “Plaintiffs alleging violations of their constitutional rights deserve to be heard in a court of law—not by a commission acting as both the prosecutor and the judge.”— L. Margaret Harker, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA “When will federal agencies get the message? The Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly in cases like Cochran and Jarkesy. Defendants in agency enforcement actions have a right to contest constitutional aspects of their cases, at least, in federal district court. It is surprising to see this administration stan for the Administrative State by resisting federal district court jurisdiction.”— Mark Chenoweth, President, NCLA For more information visit the amicus page here. ABOUT NCLA NCLA is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group founded by prominent legal scholar Philip Hamburger to protect constitutional freedoms from violations by the Administrative State. NCLA’s public-interest litigation and other pro bono advocacy strive to tame the unlawful power of state and federal agencies and to foster a new civil liberties movement that will help restore Americans’ fundamental rights.

Title: Ethereum’s hidden ‘death spiral’ mechanic could freeze $800 billion in assets regardless of their safety rating

The Bank of Italy warns of systemic risk as Ethereum's collapsing price could pave the way for network hijacking and asset manipulation. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. An Ethereum price collapse could break the blockchain’s ability to settle transactions and freeze over $800 billion in assets, a Bank of Italy research paper warns. The paper, authored by Claudia Biancotti of the central bank’s Directorate General for Information Technology, outlined a contagion scenario where ETH's price collapse degrades the blockchain’s security infrastructure to the point of failure. Such a breakdown, the report argues, would trap and compromise tokenized stocks, bonds, and stablecoins that major financial institutions are increasingly placing on public ledgers. Essentially, the paper challenges the assumption that regulated assets issued on public blockchains are insulated from the volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency. According to the report, the reliability of the settlement layer in permissionless networks like Ethereum is inextricably tied to the market value of an unbacked token. The paper's core argument rests on the fundamental difference between traditional financial market infrastructure and permissionless blockchains. In traditional finance, settlement systems are operated by regulated entities with formal oversight, capital requirements, and central bank backstops. These entities are paid in fiat currency to ensure trades are finalized legally and technically. In contrast, the Ethereum network relies on a decentralized workforce of “validators”. These are independent operators who verify and finalize transactions. However, they are not legally mandated to serve the financial system. So, they are motivated by profit. The planned jump in capacity relies on a fragile shift to ZK-proof verification that could buckle under network stress. Validators incur real-world costs for hardware, internet connectivity, and cybersecurity. Yet, their revenue is denominated primarily in ETH. The paper notes that even if staking yields remain stable in token terms, a “substantial and persistent” drop in the dollar price of ETH could obliterate the real-world value of those earnings. If the revenue generated by validating transactions falls below the cost of running the equipment, rational operators will shut down. The paper describes a potential “downward price spiral accompanied by persistent negative expectations,” where stakers rush to sell their holdings to avoid further losses. Selling staked ETH requires “unstaking,” which effectively deactivates a validator. The report warns that in an extreme limit scenario, “no validators means that the network does not work anymore.” Under these conditions, the settlement layer would effectively cease to function, leaving users able to submit transactions that are never processed. So, assets residing on the chain would become “immovable,” regardless of their off-chain creditworthiness. Meanwhile, this threat extends beyond a simple halt in processing. The paper argues that a price collapse would drastically lower the cost for malicious actors to hijack the network. This vulnerability is framed through the concept of the “economic security budget,” defined as the minimum investment required to acquire enough stake to mount a sustained attack on the network. On Ethereum, controlling more than 50% of the active validation power enables an attacker to manipulate the consensus mechanism. This situation would enable double-spending and the censorship of specific transactions. As of September 2025, the paper estimates Ethereum’s economic security budget was approximately 17 million ETH, or roughly $71 billion. Under normal market conditions, the author notes, this high cost makes an attack “extremely unlikely.” However, the security budget is not static; it fluctuates with the token's market price. If ETH’s price collapses, the dollar cost to corrupt the network falls in tandem. Simultaneously, as honest validators exit the market to cut losses, the total pool of active stake shrinks, further lowering the threshold for an attacker to gain majority control. The paper outlines a perverse inverse relationship: As the value of the network’s native token approaches zero, the cost of attacking the infrastructure plummets, yet the incentive to attack it may increase due to the presence of other valuable assets. This dynamic poses a specific risk to the “real-world” assets (RWAs) and stablecoins that have proliferated on the Ethereum network. As of late 2025, Ethereum hosted more than 1.7 million assets with a total capitalization exceeding $800 billion. This figure included roughly $140 billion in combined market capitalization for the two largest dollar-backed stablecoins. In a scenario where ETH has lost nearly all its value, the token itself would be of little interest to a sophisticated attacker. However, the infrastructure would still house billions of dollars in tokenized treasury bills, corporate bonds, and fiat-backed stablecoins. The report argues these assets would become the primary targets. If an attacker gains control of the weakened chain, they could theoretically double-spend these tokens by sending them to an exchange to be sold for fiat while simultaneously sending them to a different wallet on-chain. This brings the shock directly into the traditional financial system. If issuers, broker-dealers, or funds are legally bound to redeem these tokenized assets at face value, but the on-chain ownership records are compromised or manipulated, the financial stress transfers from the crypto market to real-world balance sheets. Considering this, the paper warns that the damage would not be confined to speculative crypto traders, “especially if issuers were legally bound to reimburse them at face value.” JP Morgan’s move into tokenized funds poses new challenges to traditional stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. In conventional financial crises, panic often triggers a “flight to safety,” in which participants shift capital from distressed to stable venues. However, such a migration may be impossible during a collapse of blockchain infrastructure. For an investor holding a tokenized asset on a failing Ethereum network, a flight to safety could mean moving that asset to another blockchain. Yet, that presents significant obstacles to this “switch in infrastructure.” First, cross-chain bridges, which are protocols used to move assets between blockchains, are notoriously vulnerable to hacks and may not scale to handle a mass exodus during a panic. These bridges could come under attack, and further rising uncertainty could cause assets to be “speculated against,” potentially causing “weaker stablecoins” to de-peg. Second, the ecosystem's decentralized nature makes coordination difficult. Unlike a centralized stock exchange that can halt trading to cool a panic, Ethereum is a global system with conflicting incentives. Third, a significant portion of assets may be trapped in DeFi protocols. According to DeFiLlama data, about $85 billion is locked in DeFi contracts at the time of writing, and many of these protocols act as automated asset managers with governance processes that cannot respond instantly to a settlement-layer failure. Furthermore, the paper highlights the lack of a “lender of last resort” in the crypto ecosystem. While Ethereum has built-in mechanisms to slow the speed of validator exits, capping processing to about 3,600 exits per day, these are technical throttles, not economic backstops. The author also dismissed the idea that deep-pocketed actors like exchanges could stabilize a crashing ETH price through “massive buys,” calling it “very unlikely to work” in a true crisis of confidence where the market might attack the rescue fund itself. The Bank of Italy paper ultimately frames this contagion risk as a pressing policy question: Should permissionless blockchains be treated as critical financial market infrastructure? The author notes that while some firms prefer permissioned blockchains run by authorized entities, the allure of public chains remains strong due to their reach and interoperability. The paper cites the BlackRock BUIDL fund, a tokenized money market fund available on Ethereum and Solana, as a prime example of early-stage traditional finance activity on public rails. However, the analysis suggests that importing this infrastructure comes with the unique risk that the “health of the settlement layer is tied to the market price of a speculative token.” Reallocation by major holders drives BUIDL-I share class drawdown, impacting BlackRock fund's net outflow. The paper concludes that central banks “cannot be expected” to prop up the price of privately issued native tokens simply to keep the settlement infrastructure secure. Instead, it suggests that regulators may need to impose strict business continuity requirements on issuers of backed assets. The most concrete proposal in the document calls for issuers to maintain off-chain databases of ownership and to designate a pre-selected “contingency chain.” This would theoretically allow porting assets to a new network if the underlying Ethereum layer fails. Without such safeguards, the paper warns, the financial system risks sleepwalking into a scenario where a crash in a speculative crypto asset halts the plumbing of legitimate finance.

Title: Google's corporate parent joins $4 trillion club as investors continue to bet on AI breakthroughs

Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Monday became the fourth Big Tech powerhouse to be valued at $4 trillion, a once seemingly unfathomable milestone that’s become more like a rite of passage amid an artificial intelligence arms race Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Monday became the fourth Big Tech powerhouse to be valued at $4 trillion, a once seemingly unfathomable milestone that's become more like a rite of passage amid an artificial intelligence arms race. Alphabet reached the threshold just four months after Google dodged the U.S. government's attempt to break up its internet empire following a ruling last year that branded its ubiquitous search engine an illegal monopoly. In an effort to prevent further abuses, a federal judge overseeing the case ordered a shake-up that investors widely interpreted as a slap on the wrist, resulting in a 57% increase in Alphabet's stock price since then that has created an additional $1.4 trillion in shareholder wealth. The rapid run-up thrust Alphabet into a $4 trillion club that has previously welcomed computer chipmaker Nvidia, which became the first to cross the barrier in July. Both Apple and Microsoft also surpassed market values of $4 trillion last year, but they have fallen back mid worries that the spending spree on AI will turn into a bubble that bursts. Nvidia's market value briefly topped $5 trillion in late October, before backtracking as the AI bubble fears also exacted a toll on its stock price because its chipsets are needed to power the technology. Meanwhile, Amazon is currently valued at $2.6 trillion, in part because of its AI ambitions, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms is valued at $1.6 trillion for some of the same reasons. Electric automaker Tesla also is betting heavily on AI, a gambit that prompted the company — now valued at $1.5 trillion — to approve a compensation package t hat would pay CEO Elon Musk $1 trillion if several targets are hit, including reaching a market value of more than $8.5 trillion. Alphabet joined the $4 trillion club on the same day that Apple announced it will rely on Google’s AI technology to help smarten up its virtual assistant Siri after coming up short in its own efforts to bring more advanced features to the iPhone. Google is well positioned to become one of the big winners in the AI battle because it is deploying the technology to transform its search engine into more of a conversational answer engine to compete against the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Perplexity. The next generation of the Gemini model underlying Google's AI technology has been winning rave reviews since its recent release, helping to drive up Alphabet's stock price while the shares of other AI-driven companies have dipped with ongoing bubble worries. Google's Cloud division that sells AI tools to corporate customers and government agencies has emerged as Alphabet's fastest growing segment during the past three years while AI technology has enabled its Waymo robotaxi division to dispatch more self-driving vehicles in cities across the U.S. The competitive threats posed by rising AI stars such as OpenAI and Perplexity is one of the reasons that U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rebuffed the U.S. Justice Department's proposal to force Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser. The judge reasoned the technological advances unleashed by AI already have been forcing significant changes in online search. Alphabet's market value could plunge if investor sentiment about the company's exposure to a potential AI bubble suddenly shift. Even Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai conceded that some market “irrationality” is contributing to the skyrocketing market values of Big Tech companies during a November interview with the BBC. “I think no company is going to be immune, including us,” Pichai said if the AI-driven euphoria suddenly evaporates. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donates $45 million to LGBTQ+ youth hotline organization, The Trevor Project

The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization’s history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott’s gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit’s board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project’s 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it’s not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations’ business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization’s revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization’s annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. That may be because Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, conducts extensive research on organizations before making grants. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? … What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott’s second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project’s mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Title: JPMorgan Backs Altice USA’s Refinancing of TPG, Goldman Debt
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/jpmorgan-backs-altice-usa-s-refinancing-of-tpg-goldman-debt-11768249813849.html
Time Published: 2026-01-12T20:30:13Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. is lending Altice USA an additional roughly $1.1 billion to refinance debt before an early repayment penalty kicks in, a move that may sooth creditors still reeling from a bombshell antitrust lawsuit and controversial debt maneuver. JPMorgan is providing the funds so that Altice can refinance the loan — a $1 billion asset-backed facility it got from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and TPG Angelo Gordon in July — at par value, according to people familiar with the matter. The debt’s call protection period starts in the coming days, meaning Altice would have to pay a premium above par to refinance. Representatives for JPMorgan, TPG and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A representative for Altice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Any efforts to preserve Altice’s cash are likely to appease creditors to the embattled telecommunications firm, which has struggled under a heavy debt load and has brought on advisers to evaluate its options. Its lenders have also been rocked by some of its recent moves. In November, the US unit of billionaire Patrick Drahi’s telecom empire sued creditors including Apollo Capital Management LP, Ares Management LLC and BlackRock Financial Management Inc., alleging they had formed an “illegal cartel” when they struck a so-called cooperation agreement. That same month, Altice — which recently rebranded as Optimum Communications Inc. — raised $2 billion from JPMorgan for the early refinancing of a loan due in 2028. While that loan carried some of the strictest investor safeguards in the company’s capital structure, the borrowing was raised with collateral that had been removed from existing creditors, effectively making JPMorgan more senior in the debt repayment line, Moody’s Ratings said in a report. The refinancing comes before a premium kicks in that could allow the lenders to capture as much as 116 cents on the dollar. The asset-backed facility due 2031 is secured by receivables generated by the company’s Bronx and Brooklyn service area and network assets, primarily the Hybrid-Fiber Coaxial network.

Title: 3 Dividend Stocks With High Yields and a Triple-Digit Upside Potential

Investing Verizon (VZ) trades at under 9x earnings with a 6.82% dividend yield despite generating $26.2B in pre-tax income. Hormel Foods (HRL) offers a 5% yield and has raised dividends for 59 consecutive years. HP (HPQ) trades below 7x forward earnings with a 5.59% yield and a sub-37% payout ratio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © CHIEW / Shutterstock.com You don’t have to settle for a moderate yield with moderate upside if you like dividend stocks. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) offer both a high yield and upside potential in the coming years and can greatly outperform the broader market. You can still buy stocks with a lower yield, but it’s worth keeping in mind that even a 4% yield is outclassed by Treasuries that yield over 4.8% while being risk-free. At the same time, the market is littered with cash-rich companies that are going through a tough period. I argue these dividend stocks are bound to inevitably bounce back once the storm passes. You’ll be able to snag the dividend payouts plus the massive upside once that happens. Let’s take a look. Verizon is one of the most mispriced cash cows on the stock market today. It is one of the largest telecommunications businesses and has more than proved itself in the past few years. Telecom companies are usually debt-laden and were considered more on the discretionary side. However, Verizon managed to generate positive cash flow despite exceptional interest rates, increase its dividends, and keep its customer base steady. In fact, customers have shown that their internet subscription is actually essential to them. They’re unlikely to go offline no matter how tough the economic situation is, and that makes Verizon a solid safe haven to buy into for a high and dependable yield. VZ stock carries a 6.82% dividend yield today and trades at less than 9 times earnings. Sure, it has over $170 billion of total debt on its balance sheet, but pre-tax income of $26.2 billion over the past year is more than enough to service that debt and pay growing dividends. Once interest rates look less scary, I expect VZ stock to make a full recovery and beyond, likely reaching $80. Hormel Foods has taken a beating over the past five years and is down 48.2% over that period. This company makes a variety of branded food products. While inflation initially helped it, the momentum has gone downhill since 2021. Regardless, I now believe it is too cheap to ignore. HRL stock now comes with a dividend yield of over 5%. Better yet, dividends have been raised for 59 years consecutively. The payout ratio still leaves room for more modest increases. I expect this cash cow business to do a lot better. EPS is expected to continue growing above a 6% clip in both FY 2026 and FY 2027, along with revenue growth above 2%. You may argue that the 16 times forward earnings premium is thus fair value for the stock, but I’d disagree. Such a low valuation would only be fair if HRL stock came with a lower yield and a more fickle cash flow. I see the forward PE ratio climbing above 25x in the coming years as interest rates drop, allowing the yield to be appreciated more by the Street. HP Inc. makes personal computers, printers, laptops, etc. It is not to be confused with HPE, which makes servers and storage. HPQ stock is down over 34% in the past year, and I believe it’s worth buying into the weakness now. The company has solid, stable cash flow, with computer and printing businesses still being very lucrative and reliable. Component prices are explosive, but this isn’t a one-sided affair that many doom-and-gloom analysts expect will kill HP Inc. Instead, it could turn HPQ much hotter. Customers are willing to cover the cost of rising components. Plus, the company has strong links to enterprise clients who keep orders steady year after year. As a result, EPS is expected to stay flat in FY 2026 and grow at a 4% clip in FY 2027, along with a modest sales increase below a 2% growth rate. These aren’t sexy figures, but they show a lot of resilience that most other companies do not have in the electronics sector. You get a forward dividend yield of 5.59%. The real kicker is that the payout ratio is less than 37%. Management has been increasing the dividend at over 10% annually on average over the past 5 months. The business itself doesn’t need to grow at a flashy pace before Wall Street starts paying more due to how much income it can churn out. HPQ trades at less than 7 times forward earnings.

Title: What's behind Trump's feud with world's most powerful central banker

Trump's fight with Federal Reserve Chair Powell just took a new twist — sending stocks and the dollar lower and lifting gold. DW looks into whether a new criminal investigation could put the Fed's independence at risk. Federal prosecutors in the United States have launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress on the $2.5 billion (€2.14 billion) renovation of the US central bank's headquarters in Washington, DC. Powell confirmed the probe Sunday in a statement posted on the social media platform X, hitting back at what he said was pressure from the Trump administration on interest rate policy. During US President Donald Trump's first term and since he returned to the White House one year ago, the pair have clashed repeatedly over interest rate decisions made by Powell The Fed chair has maintained that the central bank must set policy independently — guided by economic data rather than political pressure. Trump has grown increasingly vocal in his criticism of the Fed's decisions — notably in March, when the US central bank held interest rates steady. The president wrote on his Truth Social platform that the Fed would be "MUCH better off CUTTING RATES." In April's so-called Liberation Day announcement, Trump said lower rates would help the US economy deal with his sweeping new import tariffs on goods from major trading partners. After calling Powell "stupid" and a "numbskull," Trump went further in July after the Fed still failed to cut rates, saying the policy was "hurting people." That month, Trump even visited the Fed’s headquarters — the first such trip by a sitting president in decades — which was widely seen as expressing his dissatisfaction with Powell. Trump also moved against other senior Fed figures, including Governor Lisa Cook, whom he sought to remove over unrelated allegations. The subsequent litigation is awaiting a hearing in the US Supreme Court. By midyear, US media outlets reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had emerged as a front-runner to replace Powell when his term ends in May. He has since downplayed his candidacy. Other reports suggested that the Trump administration was sounding out a wider list of possible successors. More recently, US media outlets have focused on four candidates: longtime Trump loyalist Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. By the end of 2025, Trump said he would announce Powell's successor in January. The growing speculation underscored how much pressure the chairman was facing well before the criminal investigation became public over the weekend. The probe stems from Powell's appearance before the US Senate Banking Committee in June, when he downplayed cost overruns related to the Fed office renovation and unnecessary luxury features, including rooftop terraces and gardens, premium marble flooring and private art collections. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott had raised concerns prompted by a New York Post article that likened the project to the French Palace of Versailles — the former royal residence near Paris commissioned by King Louis XIV. Powell pushed back at what he said were "inaccurate" and "misleading" claims and denied luxury add-ons, saying the project, which is self-funded by the Fed rather than via taxpayers, focused on modernization and long-term cost savings. A month later, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna announced that she was referring Powell to the Department of Justice (DOJ), accusing him of perjury and making false statements. As the DOJ rarely comments on active investigations, a spokesperson for the agency declined to react to Powell's statement on Sunday, but said: "The Attorney General has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars." In his video statement, Powell labeled the investigation as "unprecedented action," which he said is really linked to the Trump administration's pressure over interest‑rate policy. "This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. ... Those are pretexts. ... This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether, instead, monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation," the Fed chair said. "Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats," Powell said, adding that he would continue to do the job "with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people." The probe caused a selloff in US stocks and the dollar on Monday, while Gold jumped to a record $4,600.33 per ounce. Trump has denied any knowledge of or involvement in the DOJ probe, but repeated his belief that Powell is "certainly not very good at the Fed and he's not very good at building buildings." In an interview with NBC News on Sunday night, Trump said: "What should pressure him [Powell] is the fact that rates are far too high — that's the only pressure he's got." As the central bank of the world's largest economy, the Fed's core mission is to set interest rates, keep inflation close to its 2% goal, support maximum employment and keep the financial system stable. It also supervises banks, acts as a lender of last resort during financial crises and helps keep credit flowing through the US economy, which has for decades also been the world's most attractive investment market. As the US dollar is the world's so-called reserve currency in which much of world trade is conducted, the Fed’s interest‑rate decisions have ripple effects globally, influencing borrowing costs, capital flows and economic growth far beyond the United States. The Fed is not funded by the US government; instead, it earns income from loans to corporate banks and its investments in US government bonds, currencies and other securities. The Fed's independence is widely seen as critical to avoid political pressure, which is often based on short-term goals because of the four-year US presidential election cycle. The bank's decisions to cut or raise interest rates are vital to prevent high inflation and steady the US economy during downturns. Though these moves may be unpopular among voters, proponents of Fed independence say handing interest rate control to elected politicians would risk destabilizing the economy. In reaction to the Powell probe, Capital Economics disputed whether central bank independence has helped keep inflation low historically and warned that high levels of public debt would make it harder to control price rises via interest rate hikes. But the London-based research house warned that "any shift away from monetary policy autonomy would send a worrying signal of a weaker commitment to maintaining low inflation." Many economists and corporate leaders believe that Trump's unprecedented tariffs have already hurt investor confidence in US sovereign debt and the economy's long-term future. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

A month later, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna announced that she was referring Powell to the Department of Justice (DOJ), accusing him of perjury and making false statements. As the DOJ rarely comments on active investigations, a spokesperson for the agency declined to react to Powell's statement on Sunday, but said: "The Attorney General has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars." In his video statement, Powell labeled the investigation as "unprecedented action," which he said is really linked to the Trump administration's pressure over interest‑rate policy. "This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. ... Those are pretexts. ... This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether, instead, monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation," the Fed chair said. "Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats," Powell said, adding that he would continue to do the job "with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people." The probe caused a selloff in US stocks and the dollar on Monday, while Gold jumped to a record $4,600.33 per ounce. Trump has denied any knowledge of or involvement in the DOJ probe, but repeated his belief that Powell is "certainly not very good at the Fed and he's not very good at building buildings." In an interview with NBC News on Sunday night, Trump said: "What should pressure him [Powell] is the fact that rates are far too high — that's the only pressure he's got." As the central bank of the world's largest economy, the Fed's core mission is to set interest rates, keep inflation close to its 2% goal, support maximum employment and keep the financial system stable. It also supervises banks, acts as a lender of last resort during financial crises and helps keep credit flowing through the US economy, which has for decades also been the world's most attractive investment market. As the US dollar is the world's so-called reserve currency in which much of world trade is conducted, the Fed’s interest‑rate decisions have ripple effects globally, influencing borrowing costs, capital flows and economic growth far beyond the United States. The Fed is not funded by the US government; instead, it earns income from loans to corporate banks and its investments in US government bonds, currencies and other securities. The Fed's independence is widely seen as critical to avoid political pressure, which is often based on short-term goals because of the four-year US presidential election cycle. The bank's decisions to cut or raise interest rates are vital to prevent high inflation and steady the US economy during downturns. Though these moves may be unpopular among voters, proponents of Fed independence say handing interest rate control to elected politicians would risk destabilizing the economy. In reaction to the Powell probe, Capital Economics disputed whether central bank independence has helped keep inflation low historically and warned that high levels of public debt would make it harder to control price rises via interest rate hikes. But the London-based research house warned that "any shift away from monetary policy autonomy would send a worrying signal of a weaker commitment to maintaining low inflation." Many economists and corporate leaders believe that Trump's unprecedented tariffs have already hurt investor confidence in US sovereign debt and the economy's long-term future. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

Title: The Trevor Project receives $45M from MacKenzie Scott after difficult years and federal funding cuts

Time Published: 2026-01-12T17:52:34Z

By THALIA BEATY, Associated Press The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization’s history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott’s gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit’s board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project’s 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it’s not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations’ business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization’s revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization’s annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. Elisha Smith Arrillaga, vice president of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, said that’s likely because of the vigorous vetting that Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, does before making gifts. She also said just like an investor might double down on a for-profit startup that’s struggling, some funders may still believe in an organization’s potential despite setbacks. “People make all different kinds of investments because they really believe in the outcomes that organization can make and what their gifts can do to help accelerate that,” Smith Arrillaga said. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? … What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott’s second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project’s mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Title: Bitcoin is one of the ‘best-performing assets of this decade’ – Saylor

Time Published: 2026-01-12T17:00:14Z
Full Content:
If late 2025 tested Saylor’s conviction, early 2026 is beginning to confirm it. Strategy’s Michael Saylor has once again drawn attention to the impact of his company’s Bitcoin [BTC]-centric strategy, arguing that it has fundamentally reshaped its market performance. In a post shared on X, Saylor highlighted how the firm has outpaced most Wall Street heavyweights since pivoting to Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset on 10th August 2020. For those unaware, he usually refers to this period as the “Bitcoin Standard Era.” Backing his claim with comparative data, Saylor shared a chart tracking annualized returns across major assets during this timeframe. While Nvidia leads the pack with a staggering 1,557% surge and a 68% compound annual growth rate, Strategy ranks second overall. The company has posted gains of 1,173%, translating into annualized returns of 60%, placing it ahead of nearly all traditional equities and asset classes. Notably, even Bitcoin has delivered comparatively lower returns over the same period. Since August 2020, Bitcoin has risen 674%, equating to an annualized gain of roughly 45%. Taking to X, Saylor noted, “The best-performing assets of this decade are Digital Intelligence $NVDA, Digital Credit $MSTR, and Digital Capital $BTC.” Source: Michael Saylor/X Needless to say, this shift wasn’t driven by hype but by infrastructure. In 2025, digital assets moved beyond retail speculation and became a core part of global financial infrastructure. The rise of the “Bitcoin Treasury” model drove this shift. Following the approach popularized by Michael Saylor, more than 170 public companies adopted Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. By late 2025, NVIDIA further strengthened its dominance with the launch of its Blackwell and Rubin platforms. As a result, what once seemed like an extreme bet is now widely viewed as a survival strategy. Echoing Saylor’s sentiment, one X user added, Source: X However, not everyone was on the same page, as all-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff noted, “Yes, but all that changed toward the end of the decade when $MSTR tanked and $BTC fell. For the next decade the worst-performing assets will likely be Digital Credit MSTR and Digital Capital BTC.” This coincided with NVIDIA Corp. trading at $184.86, following a dip of 0.097%, yet maintaining a robust annual growth of 38.75%. In contrast, MSTR faced a sharper decline, trading at $157.33 after a 9.64% daily drop and a staggering 171.07% decrease over the past year. Meanwhile, BTC slipped to $90,467.38, marking a minor 0.14% dip and a broader 4% weekly decline according to CoinMarketCap. This shows that if the final quarter of 2025 served as a violent stress test for Michael Saylor’s conviction, the opening days of 2026 are proving to be his vindication.

Title: Bitcoin ETF redemptions explain why BTC stalled near $91k

Bitcoin’s rally stalled near $91,000 as BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led more than $300m in redemptions. Bitcoin’s rally stalled on 12 January as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another daily negative flow to cap the week. BlackRock’s IBIT led the selling and triggered a wave of real BTC transfers to Coinbase Prime. According to Lookonchain data, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined net outflow of 3,734 BTC on the day, equivalent to roughly $339 million at current prices. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust [IBIT] accounted for the bulk of that move, shedding 2,791 BTC, while Grayscale’s products lost a further 891 BTC. The selling came as Bitcoin struggled to hold above the $91,000–$92,000 range, failing to sustain a breakout after a brief rally earlier in the session. Blockchain data adds a crucial layer to the ETF flows. Arkham Intelligence shows that wallets linked to BlackRock’s IBIT sent large tranches of Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime within hours on 12 January. The transactions, visible on Arkham’s tracker, include a long series of transfers of 300 BTC each, alongside a smaller 143 BTC transaction. In total, the visible deposits exceed 3,400 BTC, broadly matching the size of IBIT’s reported daily outflow. Source: Arkham Intelligence Coinbase Prime is the primary settlement venue used by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. When ETF shares are redeemed, authorized participants receive Bitcoin, which is typically routed through Prime before being sold into the spot market or redistributed across trading desks. The on-chain flows therefore suggest that BlackRock’s ETF redemptions were not simply accounting entries but translated into real Bitcoin being delivered into exchange liquidity pools. The data highlights a structural shift in how Bitcoin trades since the launch of spot ETFs. While ETFs initially acted as a powerful demand engine in 2024, they now operate in both directions. When investors withdraw capital, ETF issuers must source Bitcoin from custody and deliver it into the market, turning redemptions into direct sell-side pressure. On 12 January, BlackRock alone was responsible for nearly three-quarters of total Bitcoin ETF outflows, making IBIT the dominant driver of the day’s liquidity event. Grayscale’s products also continued to see outflows, though on a smaller scale. At the same time, Fidelity’s FBTC recorded a modest +87 BTC inflow, insufficient to offset the broader selling. Bitcoin attempted to extend its January recovery earlier in the day but was rejected above $92,000, before sliding back toward $91,000 as ETF-linked selling emerged. The timing of the Arkham-tracked deposits aligns closely with the intraday reversal, reinforcing the view that institutional flow, not retail sentiment, is now setting short-term price direction. With more than 1.29 million BTC now held across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, even modest percentage shifts in investor positioning can translate into thousands of coins hitting the market in a single session. The episode underlines how Bitcoin has entered a new phase of market plumbing. ETF inflows and outflows are no longer just sentiment indicators; they now drive physical settlement flows that ripple directly into spot liquidity. BlackRock’s transfer of thousands of BTC to Coinbase Prime shows how quickly ETF demand can flip from absorption to distribution. Price action around key levels is now increasingly influenced by institutional portfolio decisions, rather than just speculative trading.

Title: Two Low-Cost Airlines Plan to Merge. Wall Street Likes the Deal.

Investors see sunshine for Sun Country Airlines stock following news that it plans to merge with another ultra-low-cost carrier. Sun Country (SNCY) shares were up some 12% Monday, a day after the airline agreed to combine with fellow ultra-low-cost carrier Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT) to "create a leading leisure-focused U.S. airline." Allegiant's stock was down about 6%. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's trading here.) Las Vegas-based Allegiant will acquire Minneapolis-based Sun Country for $1.5 billion in cash and stock, including $400 million of net debt. The deal might not not be the last move to consolidate the domestic low-cost space. Spirit Airlines owner Spirit Aviation (FLYY) entered the Chapter 11 restructuring process for the second time in less than a year in late August. Frontier Group (ULCC), the parent of Frontier Airlines, replaced longtime CEO Barry Biffle last month amid a sharply declining stock price. The deal, which would merge two low-cost air carriers, could herald more merger activity in the sector. Investors applauded the news that Sun Country and Allegiant planned to merge, with the companies seen as reliably profitable and serving complimentary markets. Upon closing, which is expected in the second half of 2026, Allegiant and Sun Country shareholders would own about 67% and 33%, respectively, of the combined company, which would continue under the Allegiant name. Each would operate separately until they obtain a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration. Allegiant CEO Gregory Anderson would serve as the combined company's CEO, while Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker would join the board and serve as an advisor to Anderson. The new company would be headquartered in Las Vegas but keep "a significant presence" in Minneapolis-St. Paul, according to the release announcing the deal. "Allegiant and Sun Country are well positioned to create one of the most adaptable and resilient airline models in the industry, with the ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions, traveler demand, and charter and cargo partner needs," the release said. The deal may not face substantial regulatory concern, as the carriers have served different markets. Allegiant flies routes with little competition from small cities, while Sun Country handles cargo flights for Amazon (AMZN), charter routes, and scheduled flights across the U.S. and to international destinations in Mexico, Canada, Central America, and the Caribbean. Deutsche Bank analysts called the deal a "merger of two equally well-run low-fare airlines" with reliably solid margins. "As two of the industry's most profitable airlines, we view them as 'equals,' particularly as they are the only two low-fare carriers that have been consistently profitable," they wrote.

Title: The Trevor Project receives $45M from MacKenzie Scott after difficult years and federal funding cuts

The nonprofit Trevor Project received a $45 million gift from billionaire MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025 The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization's history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott's gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit's board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project's 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it's not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations' business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization's revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization's annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. That may be because Scott's team, the members of which are largely unknown, conducts extensive research on organizations before making grants. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? ... What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott's second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project's mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the 988 service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. Since the program’s end, The Trevor Project’s hotline has become even more central to mental health support for queer young people, said Scott Bertani, director of advocacy at the National Coalition for LGBTQ Health. “Their services fill a gap that generic crisis lines simply aren’t designed to meet, particularly for young people facing identity-based stress, isolation or rejection,” Bertani said in a statement. The Trevor Project has faced internal turmoil after its budget grew from around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns.

Elisha Smith Arrillaga, vice president of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, said that’s likely because of the vigorous vetting that Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, does before making gifts. She also said just like an investor might double down on a for-profit startup that’s struggling, some funders may still believe in an organization’s potential despite setbacks. “People make all different kinds of investments because they really believe in the outcomes that organization can make and what their gifts can do to help accelerate that,” Smith Arrillaga said.

Full Content:
January 12, 2026 This isn't my usual deep-dive article where I unpack a specific subject such as an app I built, my obsession with craft, or revisiting an old iPod. I set out to share a few reflections and musings on a year marked by personal and professional change. This was a year of stripping back to the essentials: where I live, how I work, and what I build. I've been running this site for just over 20 years now. I began writing it in my dorm room at Georgia Tech, hosted on a G4 Mac Mini1, as a way for me to share technical how-to guides and news. I used WordPress for the first handful of years, then the Ruby static site generator Jekyll for a decade. It wasn't until 2024 that I redesigned and rebuilt this site from scratch using Next.js.2 I'll be turning 40 years old in 2026, which is still surreal to me. For my entire career, I was always the younger one on the team, and what feels like a sudden shift means that's no longer true. In many ways, that change is actually a clarifying feeling. I'm more focused and fired up to do great work than I've ever been. I'm driven by the desire to craft great products: things I can be proud of working on. My framing shifted from "Can I help this team build this product?" to "Is this the problem I want to spend my best years on?" I've developed a visceral aversion to working in any environment where I don't feel like I can do the best work of my career. The view from the Sesame office in San Francisco where I now work My taste and judgment have compounded over these years. I've been through similar experiences that I can draw from across whatever I'm working on. Even on minor UI challenges alone, I'm still surprised at how often I pull inspiration from my time at Twitter where density was king and compact timelines ruled everything. I always try to keep that as just one input though, especially working in AI when so much is continually changing and you can't bring assumptions with you.3 Table of contents The year started with me finally selling the one-bedroom condo I had purchased a decade earlier. I completely regret purchasing that place. Not because it had major maintenance issues or anything like that, but because it was a horrible investment. I had it for 10 years and still lost money on it once you factor in the lower sale price, prep work to sell (staging, floor upgrades, painting), and associated fees. It was a relatively new building in a bustling shopping and restaurant area in Nob Hill near Russian Hill. The entire building was only nine years old when I bought my unit, so I only had minor maintenance tasks over the years. I loved living there. The unit was modern, had a good HOA, no issues with neighbors, and had 500/500 Webpass as the ISP (this was before fiber was commonplace and before Google Fiber purchased Webpass). The condo staged for sale. Why did I buy this place to begin with? I got it in 2015 when I was 29. I had been at Twitter for a few years and made some money from the Twitter IPO. I hated having roommates, and the alternative of paying $4,000–$5,000 a month to rent my own apartment didn't feel like a good idea. And at the time, it felt like you couldn't go wrong buying in San Francisco. More and more companies were becoming SF-based instead of Silicon Valley, and many friends and coworkers around me were buying homes too. I purchased it with 25% down and a 2.75% 7-year ARM mortgage from First Republic Bank (RIP, they were great). I figured seven years was plenty of time to either sell or refinance before the rates increased. That didn't help either. I moved to New York in 2019 and rented out my condo through a property management company that handled everything while I was out of state. I was in NYC for four years and lost money every month renting it out. Not to mention the property management company was horrible and a pain to deal with. My 7-year ARM's fixed period ended in mid-2022 while I was in New York while the rate was increasing monthly. By the time I sold the unit, my expired 2.75% ARM mortgage had exceeded 7.5%. It wasn't worth refinancing by then, I knew I wanted to sell it soon. My wife and I came back to San Francisco in 2023. That same horrible property management company forgot to have the tenant sign a lease (you had one job..), and the tenant ended up moving out unexpectedly a few months in. It lined up perfectly with the end of our apartment lease in New York, so we decided to head to San Francisco for a few months to fix up the condo, sell it, then head back to NYC. When we got back in January 2023, it wasn't a great time to sell, so we stayed. We didn't mind escaping the New York winter for a while, and the AI boom was starting to make SF feel alive again. We still love New York, but at the moment it really feels like if you work in tech and AI, you need to be here. The energy is palpable. We eventually got around to selling it at the start of 2025. I always thought selling it would be a hassle and that I would need to do upgrades to make it enticing. Well, it ended up being so much easier to sell than I expected. A former coworker introduced me to a small real estate agency; they were perfect. I dropped off the keys and they took it from there. They refinished the floors, upgraded some things in the bathroom, updated the heating system, painted, and staged. In less than two months, it sold. I received 11 offers: four competitive and three all cash. Even though I lost money on the sale all things considered, I had expected it to sell for considerably less given it was listed in January instead of the ideal time in spring. I learned my lesson with this place. I don't see myself purchasing a house in San Francisco anytime soon. The opportunity cost of the down payment alone stings. It would have tripled in a basic total U.S. stock market ETF over those 10 years. We've since been renting in Noe Valley for the last year. I finally have enough space and my own garage, so I moved over all of my stuff that had been stored with family: my Eames chair, Pro Display XDR, and old gear like this original iSight. Finding this rental was a huge challenge. Every evening for what felt like a year was spent scouring rental sites before we eventually found it off-market through a friend. At one point there was an apartment in Pacific Heights we loved so much we wrote a love letter (more common with purchases, not rentals), offered many months of cash up front, and even extra rent. There was just too much competition. I frequently hear from people saying they're moving to San Francisco in a month or two. My advice is always the same: start looking for your apartment as early as possible! 2025 started with an itch. After two and a half years of working on Rewind, then through its evolution to Limitless and the Limitless Pendant, I needed a change. I needed a new design and product challenge. In my time there, we really embodied what a startup is all about. We had a true customer focus, endless product iteration, countless product strategy refinements, and long hours sweating the details. We were a remote team of ~15-20 people in recent years. I was the only designer for a period and wrote about what this was like in The Startup Designer. The Limitless team at various offsites. We built a lot of stuff as we searched for product-market fit. Rewind was a native Mac app that captured everything you'd seen (via screen capture), said and heard (via opt-in meeting and audio recording), compressed it, and made it actionable. You could visually rewind time as well as search or ask AI to find anything you've seen. I loved that it had a local-first approach, private by design, and was a bit uncanny until you got used to it. An app that records your screen all the time? Crazy. But it worked. I would tell people that making Rewind was probably a similar user and marketing challenge to what the team at 1Password likely went through when they were starting out in the mid-2000s. "You want me to put all my passwords into this one app I'm supposed to trust with my digital life?" Crazy. But it worked. The Rewind Mac app. Bottom right: Rewind website I designed and built. We also made Rewind for iOS, then I spent some time diving into Windows development with C# and WinUI as we worked on a Windows app focused on using a local LLM. While the product had some challenges with search quality due to limitations from the local approach, I still think the Rewind concept is solid. Microsoft famously thought so too and created the Rewind-inspired Recall feature. There are some things I'd approach differently if Rewind were rebuilt from the ground up today: prioritize task-based workflows over pure recall, and explore using lightweight visual models for data classification. Rewind described on Lenny's podcast We then pivoted to a cloud-based product called Limitless, largely as a result of feeling limited by what we could achieve with Rewind's local-based approach. There was the cross-platform Limitless web and desktop app, and then the React Native mobile app. The Limitless.ai website I designed and built with lots of design details. My favorite detail was custom animating cursors when you selected a new Pendant color. Limitless started with meeting recording and summary functionality. That was a recurring use case people had with Rewind. While I personally felt that functionality wasn't the most exciting thing to work on, nor did it have staying power with countless meetings-focused competitors working on the exact same thing, we had an ambitious roadmap. The goal was to continually add more data sources over time for context. One of those data sources was to be our own hardware, the Limitless Pendant, to capture in-person meetings and conversations to help differentiate us from competitors. Early versions of Limitless for iPhone I designed. The Pendant was a bold bet, but after a year of building its companion app and dogfooding it, I realized it wasn't a product for me. I take privacy extraordinarily seriously and lean introverted, so I wasn't exactly comfortable wearing a recording device out of the house and asking for consent every time I encountered someone new. On top of that, my wife wasn't comfortable with me wearing it at home either. The product had real use cases, and we heard about that consistently from customers, but it wasn't for me. Meanwhile, the tech industry was exploding as LLM capabilities improved at a rapid clip and I felt like I was watching from the sidelines. Agents, deep research, multimodal models, new interaction paradigms... I wanted to be at the forefront of that. The opportunity cost felt too high. My heart wasn't in it, and I decided to leave. The Rewind and Limitless story came to a close some months later at the end of 2025 with a Meta acquisition. It felt like a great time for the team to join a larger company with the means to really compete with AI hardware and services coming out across the industry. It was a well-deserved exit for the team. Financially, I received a modest sum for shares I had early exercised, and for my vested in-the-money stock options. I had also previously sold some equity5 right after the company's last public round. I'll likely put some of it toward a few angel investments. I've done several angel investments in the past, mostly in crypto companies like Rainbow and XMTP (the messaging protocol now used by Coinbase Base and World). However, I've declined to do them more regularly because I feel that to do a good job, you need to have the time and bandwidth to stay on top of deal flow—seek it, meet the founders, and maybe you end up investing in 1 out of every 10+ teams you come across. After leaving Limitless, I gave myself permission to slow down before jumping into something new. I ended up taking four months off, though it didn't really feel like time off at all. I was meeting with founders, companies, and VCs for weeks, and also spent time I was working on my design portfolio.In hindsight I went overkill on the portfolio—I had two versions, the most comprehensive of which was 177 slides—but the act of doing it was a great way to reflect on how I worked, what gave me energy, and what drained it. My wife made the most of me no longer working nights and weekends, and we ended up taking a few trips. First to Germany and Austria, then later to Milan and Lake Como for a friend's birthday. Altaussee and Hallstatt, Austria. I haven't traveled with my big Sony a7R IV in some years. I get by with my iPhone, shooting in RAW and minor edits in Darkroom app. I stopped consuming caffeine entirely in 2025. It was during the trip to a medical health resort called MayrLife on Lake Altaussee, Austria that made that happen. This place was strict: a set schedule with strict meal times along with no caffeine or alcohol. The alcohol part was fine, but getting off of caffeine was a challenge. I had zero alcohol in all of 2024 and maybe just 5 drinks for all of 2025. I just don't really care for it anymore, and never loved the feeling of feeling something the next morning even if I only had two cocktails the night before. After the first full year of zero alcohol, it's like I was rewired and completely don't even care for alcohol anymore. I'll have some non-alcoholic beers and mocktails at times, of course. I had been used to having a 2-3 strong cups of coffee every day. I ended up having about 4 or 5 days of caffeine withdrawal migraines as I went cold turkey. After that, I decided I didn't want to go back to my normal coffee routine. I still love coffee and have a cup of decaf every morning though. I've learned all about the different kinds of decaf processes like Swiss Water Process (chemical free; the lowest caffeine but the worst taste) and Ethyl Acetate (best taste). My current decaf favorite is by Perc Coffee, but I'm still trying out others I'm discovering on the r/decaf subreddit. Lake Como, Italy. Went for my friend Ashley's birthday. After the initial withdrawal issues, staying off of caffeine wasn't that bad. Decaf coffee doesn't dehydrate you during the day, which is something I could feel. I used to rely on melatonin and sometimes magnesium to more easily fall asleep at night after a day of coffees, but now I don't need that either. The biggest downside is that while I love the flavor of coffee it's harder to find good decaf options at coffee shops. If they do have decaf, it's likely just one kind and only served as an americano, not pour over or brewed. I also took the time to hit reset and simplify a few other things in my life. On the nerdy side, I got rid of the two servers I had been running for a while. I had one server that managed this website's email newsletter, that I publish to very infrequently. I had been using a self-hosted web app called Sendy that uses AWS SES to send emails cheaply. I ditched that in favor of Kit. But between that and my other server I used to host my personal Mastodon instance, I hated having to login every few weeks to install an update or fix something. It's a small thing, but it freed up mental space.6 I stopped wearing my Apple Watch too. I was constantly annoyed by all the useless notifications and buzzing on my wrist. While I appreciated the health tracking functionality, I wanted to simplify. It didn't start as an overnight consciousness decision. I got a simple Casio F-91W watch, changed the strap and started wearing it some days. Eventually that became everyday. Half of what I appreciate is that it's not a smartwatch. The other half I appreciate is that it's just so small and lightweight. I wrote down what was critical to me as I started thinking about what I wanted in a new role. At the end of the day, I wanted to work with an exceptionally talented team, at the forefront of AI, with leadership and a CEO who genuinely care about quality, and as little organizational friction as possible between us and an outstandingly well-crafted product. I wasn't in a rush to find the next thing. I had time and wanted to optimize for seeing what was out there first. I'm often reminded of How To Be Successful by Sam Altman, where he writes: “I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.” Being in San Francisco and being public about the fact that I was looking for my next thing was like a cheat code for that process. My days were filled as I met with several dozen founders, companies, VCs and friends. Every founder and team I met with had a unique perspective on where the world is heading, and they were fighting through the ambiguity to get there. It's still wild to me that this level of energy and ambition is just par for the course in San Francisco. I'm grateful to folks who took time to chat with me: A few things crystallized from all these conversations: All of this helped me articulate exactly what I wanted next after talking with small teams and large teams. I'm happiest, most productive, and most ambitious working on 0→1 products and bold bets that scratch at something new in AI, where there's a shared understanding of quality. I would much rather be the first designer tasked with creating an app or site from scratch than a designer or manager on a team of dozens responsible for just a sliver of an app. Not on a team of dozens optimizing something that already exists. I wanted to stay close to the craft while also growing a team. When I began this process, I actually thought I wanted to optimize for compensation and go to a late-stage, pre-IPO, or public company. I had always felt like you wanted to alternate between riskier early-stage startups and late-stage companies in your career so you wouldn't get "behind" with savings and investments. It became clear to me that was not where my heart was at all. I needed to work on something I was beyond passionate about with a team that shared that desire. Sesame ended up being everything I was looking for and more. It's been phenomenal across the board: the shared appreciation and ambition for excelling at craft, the remarkable team comprised of industry veterans, and the bold bets we're making on the product we're building. Yes… I know everyone says this about their company when they join, but that's really how I feel. I've never worked somewhere that truly cared about craft and understood it this much. A lot of that is due to the CEO, Brendan Iribe, who was one of the founders of Oculus VR. Brendan reached out after I published Browse No More. He's one of those founders I was alluding to in the previous section: someone who's really, really good at speaking about the importance of what the team is building, about taste, and about how great products are made. Sesame team offsite in Skamania, Washington I've been on enough teams to know that it really doesn't matter if various executives on the leadership team say quality matters. In my experience, it has to come directly from the CEO too. Brendan gets it; for software and for hardware. I later met the rest of the team, including the CPO Nate Mitchell (also one of the founders of Oculus VR), and it was clear this was a team I needed to work with. We're building both software and hardware. On the software side, we're building what we call personal agents. They're not productivity assistants, they're more like a collaborator and thought partner you just talk with. But even that description doesn't do our ambitions here justice. They're much more than that. We've been focusing on making them remarkably lifelike. That comes across in their unique personalities and how they carry the conversation. It's the sort of thing you need to experience to see what I mean: you can try our research preview released earlier in 2025 that over a million people have used. We're also working on an iOS app—you can get on the waitlist here. "This is not another productivity assistant. It's something different: a lifelike, expressive collaborator—designed to engage and evolve with its user over time." The second piece is hardware. We're making the world's best intelligent eyewear. They're fashion-forward and made for all-day comfort. Sequoia has more details on both our software and hardware in their article A New Era for Voice. The mission we talk about that I really love is that we're working towards bringing the computer to life with our hardware and focus on voice-first AI. We've been saying "software is eating the world" for 15 years now. Now as AI is eating software, hardware is becoming the new distribution and interaction frontier for AI. I'm not saying we won't have phones in 5 years (I still absolutely love mine), but I'm eager to spend time collaborating with the team here to see what these new interfaces will enable. "Hardware becomes a more popular moat (amid a surge of hardware startups). In a world where everyone can make their own software, unique products will emerge that tightly couple hardware and software." —Scott Belsky Sesame San Francisco one week when the NYC and Bellevue teams were visiting. Top: I'm on the left And after five years of almost entirely working from home, I'm thrilled to be back in an office. When covid started, I thought I'd never go back to the office. I loved having my own desk setup and being able to focus. Now I just miss working with people, whiteboarding design ideas, and perfecting prototypes right next to teammates. Also, teams building hardware kind of need to be in person with the number of physical prototypes we're continually crafting and testing out. It's been six months since I joined as Sesame's Head of Design, based out of our San Francisco office. My current day-to-day is heavy on design and code (Figma & Xcode for our iOS app)9 and helping out with things across product, hardware, brand, and marketing. We've got a lot in store for design this year across mobile, web, brand, and hardware. It's always a fun design challenge to work beyond just software product design. Basheer Tome joined my team to focus on hardware design, interaction design, prototyping, and everything in between. He had previously worked on Google Glass, Google Pixel Buds, autonomous driving, and all sorts of projects spanning PM, ID and CMF at Fellow. I'm looking forward to growing our design team this year. I'm the only software product designer at the moment10, and am looking to hire a seasoned product designer to work closely with me in our San Francisco office with a focus on visual design with a passion for craft and design engineering. We're hiring for quite a few different roles outside design too. I finally perfected my home office setup. For the two years prior I had a small desk in the bedroom at my previous place. Once we moved, I finally had space to build things out the way I wanted. I had room for my iMac G3 and vintage gadgets, a much larger 72x30" standing desk, and a lounge chair behind it. I also finally shipped my Pro Display XDR to San Francisco from where it had been in storage at my in-laws' house on the East Coast. iMac G3, Studio Display, Pro Display XDR, Glove80 keyboard, Uplift Standing Desk with custom LED lighting. For the last decade, I've had occasional wrist pain during extended computing sessions, but I have it under control these days with a combination of an adjustable desk (kept low enough so my elbows are properly angled), the Glove80 split ergonomic ortholinear keyboard, a Logi Lift vertical mouse, and a wrist brace for long sessions. Using a keyboard like the Glove80 (or similar models like the Kinesis Advantage2 I used before it) takes some getting used to, but it's worth it if you're in a similar boat with wrist pain from RSI. Separately, I try to use AI voice dictation apps like Aqua to speak instead of type when I can. I haven't quite built that habit yet. I've been thinking about getting a gooseneck desk mic for the office, like some other coworkers have, to do this more often. I've made a few other additions to my gear recently, but the standouts are my 333MHz Revision D iMac G3 from 1999, my original iSight camera, and my new OWC 4-bay M.2 SSD RAID enclosure. With the latter I've also started using Immich to manage my photos (hosted on my Mac, behind Tailscale) and will probably migrate my Google Photos to it. I've been meaning to post a much more in-depth article about the iMac. I updated the RAM, converted the HD to an SLC NAND flash CompactFlash card, and applied new thermal paste to the CPU heatsink. So much nostalgia. Ironically, I now work in the office on weekdays, so the setup doesn't get as much use anymore. I purchased a car for my commute, the newly redesigned 2025.5 Audi SQ5 SUV. I haven't had a car since I sold my E92 M3 about 7 years ago. Mechanically, it's great: quick, makes a nice sound, and overall fun to drive. The rest is just okay. The interior design leaves a lot to be desired. There's ugly piano black plastic everywhere and too many controls are touch-based. Driving to work… notice the check engine light that comes on and off randomly. Take it from me: don't buy the first year of a new car generation. But the icing on the cake is the garbage computer system. Not the infotainment system (though I really dislike that it lacks a traditional tachometer gauge cluster setting), but the whole car's computer system has been remarkably buggy. Various warnings and check engine lights constantly come on and then vanish on their own. I took it in for service just a month after I purchased it. They kept it for more than a week and the issues persisted. Others on Reddit are having similar problems and hope an upcoming software update will fix everything. I've definitely learned my lesson about buying a new generation car. Okay it's not an app, but I love taking notes, sketching UI designs and scratching off to-do list items in Mnemosyne x Kleid notebooks with my Baronfig Squire. I also love Uchida Le Pens for sketching too. I've gone through a few in 2025. Dia has been my primary browser for the majority of 2025. After living with Arc for the few years prior, I'm really accustomed to a browser with side tabs. I've tried to get into the ChatGPT Atlas browser and Perplexity's Comet browser but they never stuck for me, even with the promise of all their agentic functionality. I just don't really have a huge need to automate things just yet. Actually, I take that back, I would but the few times I've tried current solutions they were too slow and inaccurate. Maybe later in 2026. About 99% of what I have AI do in a browser for me is summarize long articles, and I use both Dia's integrated chat for that, and recently, Anthropic's Claude browser extension for that. I just hope that Dia keeps its craft and charm even after its parent company's acquisition by Atlassian. Flighty for insanely good flight tracking. I don't fly that much and this app is still worth every penny. I get notified of flight delays before the airlines send notifications. I can more easily look up alternate routes, see where the inbound plane is, and more. It's just a delightfully well-crafted app. Yuka lets you look up the health impact of various food and cosmetic items. My wife and I use it often to make better choices when shopping, such as avoiding harmful chemicals. There are a few apps like it but it's simple and works well. It does not have data about microplastics (you should definitely take a look at Nat Friedman's PlasticList) yet unfortunately, but other apps like Olive and Oasis Health do. These days we're much more mindful about what we bring into the house and have replaced pans with non-toxic ceramic ones, plastic cutting boards with oiled wood ones, avoiding certain dish detergents, et cetera. Mercury is hands down the best personal banking app and bank out there. There's an annual fee but you get a lovely, well-designed modern app with things like automatic transfer rules to move money around (e.g., don't keep cash in checking, always move to HYSA) and support for sending wires really easily. NetNewsWire combined with Feedbin is my RSS reader setup of choice. NNW has been around since I had a G4 Mac Mini in my college dorm in 2004. Great, simple piece of software. Though I do wish it had slightly more robust search functionality. Things has been my to-do list app for many years. Simple, well-built apps for desktop and phone. I have a few minor design gripes with it (what designer wouldn't have strong thoughts about their to-do list app) but it gets the job done. There's an unofficial Things MCP server I've been meaning to integrate into my workflow too. Raindrop is where I send articles I want to read later, curate design inspiration, save interesting links, and everything in between. It also saves a permanent copy of each link you bookmark so it's still accessible even if that page ceases to exist on the web. I try to go through it weekly to organize and review what I've saved. Obsidian (with the Cupertino theme) is my catch-all for daily notes and more. I pay for Obsidian Sync service too. While I have various folders for different types of documents from outlines and drafts of blog posts to documents for ideas, I primarily use it for work. I create a new file each week where I write notes for the week. At the bottom of each week's document I keep a running to-do list. At the end of each day I'll reprioritize that list or write down an action plan if I'm in the middle of a large task so I'm prepared the next morning. While I really love Obsidian, it's not perfect. Searching for files is really, really rough in my experience. I need to keep things in organized folders as I know I'll need to find them later and can't rely on search. Also, despite a robust developer community, there's not yet an amazing LLM solution. Fortunately everything in Obsidian is flat files, so I often use Claude Code with my Obsidian vault for things like synthesizing summaries and themes across a lot of files. And finally, the other thing I don't love about Obsidian is the mobile app navigation. It's likely a downside of it being a highly-extensible and cross-platform app, instead of a more opinionated native iOS app. Despite using all these apps for notetaking, saving, and curating, I don't really like the term second brain for this PKM stack. This quote below from I Deleted My Second Brain resonates with me to a degree, and I sometimes find myself saving things I never revisit. "The “second brain” metaphor misfits how human memory works: associative, embodied, and purposefully forgetful. When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting. Later, I believed I was solving a problem of integration. Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral. The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold. That self never arrived."" 2025 was the year of coding agents for me (and everyone else too). It's a remarkable, remarkable tool. At the start of the year I mostly used Cursor for smaller tactical changes, but I quickly became heavily dependent on Claude Code. It just kept getting better throughout the year. "Claude Code (CC) emerged as the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like - something that in a loopy way strings together tool use and reasoning for extended problem solving. In addition, CC is notable to me in that it runs on your computer and with your private environment, data and context." —Karpathy There's many articles online on the proper way to configure and use Claude Code, how to put skills, agents, and CLAUDE.md to work for you, but this thread from the Claude Code creator in particular is worth a scroll: Tools like Claude Code still need constant babysitting and can sometimes get stuck in a loop, trying the same solutions that didn't work. I find it critical to try out other models regularly, even for the same task. For example, I get the feeling that Sonnet/Opus aren't amazing at more advanced or recent SwiftUI tasks. In a recent example it gave me the old GeometryReader hack for getting scroll offset from a ScrollView instead of the single .scrollPosition() modifier I wanted. These days I'm usually bouncing between Claude Code (usually via their official extension inside Cursor, which has nice expandable inline diffs) and Gemini 3 Pro via Cursor Agents. I don't have a set workflow. Sometimes I'll have Opus make a plan, then have GPT poke holes through it before Claude Code implements. I've also dabbled with tools like Conductor. Aside from the obvious desire for faster and smarter models that just nail each task, there's one thing I wish these tools were better at: undo. I know version control is technically my job. Git exists. But when I'm iterating quickly on a specific piece of functionality, I want to easily roll back to the last known good version without thinking about it. That's often from a previous agent response. I can leave a trail of commits behind me, but that doesn't look great on a PR. I can spend more time amending commits or dealing with git rebase, but that's friction I'd rather avoid. This feels like something these tools themselves should help with. Cursor, for example, doesn't have diffs for each agent response. If you want to undo the last change, you have to ask the LLM to do it, wait, and hope nothing else unexpected is changed in the process. Compare that to just discarding changes if you'd made a git commit. Much of what I do is design something from scratch in Figma, get it to around 90% or to a point where I have a few options I can't decide between without trying them out, and then begin building it. Figma is very much still a starting point. Lots of iteration—in aesthetics, interactions, and logic—happens while I'm building and feeling it out with real builds.11 For me that even meant going deep on working with metal shaders this past year: an area that seemed too complex to approach previously.12 However, I will sometimes use Figma MCP to help speed up parts of the development workflow. The act of building and testing out as you build is what design is all about to me. It rapidly surfaces new ideas for iterations and directions. There should have never been a design to engineering "handoff" phase. It's the same thing. Every designer should be a design engineer too. Being able to more rapidly build designs and interactions also means you no longer have to scratch your head trying to decide if you should come up with a long dissertation about why a certain piece of feedback from a peer or executive isn't worth pursuing. Most of the time, you can just try it out and see how it feels that day. Don't close off paths too soon. The biggest shift in design has not been on the visual design front for me. I don't necessarily need production assets with models like Nano Banano Pro, nor are there any UI design tools good enough yet to truly enhance my visual and UI design workflow… yet. I've tried to use them for coming up with design inspiration for things like iconography and brand design tasks at times, but haven't found anything that truly enhances my workflow yet. Designers need to push on what AI isn't good at yet. To me, that means constantly seeking inspiration, curating, and communicating well. Always be curious. You need to constantly be seeking information and inspiration. It can come from anywhere. Archive what feels good, interesting, or provocative to you. Hone your taste. The best designers I know are always curating. Some on Are.na and X. Some just in their own Figma moodboards. Some with link saving tools like Raindrop. Build that habit. With Claude Code, Cursor Agents, and dozens of other AI dev tools anyone can build for themselves now. We're entering the era of rapidly created, personalized and bespoke software. It's going to seem even more insane this year. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. The hard part now isn't building. It's restraint in this world where we have more capabilities than ever. I've noticed this industry is a bit too trigger-happy to jump into Claude Code and start generating, then immediately commit what was one-shotted. Maybe we should all be doing our own product plan mode outside of Claude Code's plan mode. Taking a step back to ask what we're actually building and why before we start. It's too easy to skip the product thinking and strategy. That's the necessary but slow and hard work of deciding what should exist, why, and who it's for in the first place. What I'm referring to is just the normal product development process we've been doing for decades. Nothing new here. Just a reminder to not skip it when AI makes the building process closer and closer to a single button press. As I design things I'm continually in a loop asking myself things like: Similarly, even if AI does make something for you and does it well, quality can drop fast if you're not careful to polish and clean up everything afterwards. For code quality and product design quality. Always polish it yourself. That's where craft lives. Everyone's building some sort of agentic assistant right now. Connect your calendar. Integrate your email. Take actions. It all feels the same. A lot of assembled parts. Too many teams skip the hard parts: personality that builds trust, memory that truly enables continuity, and extensibility that meets you where you are. They also don't think enough about the why. Okay, so you can access my calendar… now when and why am I supposed to use this? That's why too many of these tools today feel like packaged slop. Personality and memory are what make these tools feel familiar and natural, not merely transactional. When GPT-4o was retired after GPT-5 launched, people were genuinely upset. They had gotten attached to how 4o wrote, how it felt. That's not nothing. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, more ambient—even worn—this will only matter more. Even in quick interactions, the wrong tone and style is immediately clocked. Personality, memory, and extensibility form the defining triad of future agentic systems that you'll want to use: It's time to stop thinking about building these systems as a series of LEGO bricks to slap together. 2025 was a lot of change compressed into twelve months—new job, new house, new daily habits. Most of it came down to getting rid of stuff, physically and mentally, that were getting in the way. Now I'm at Sesame working on problems I actually want to solve with people who care about the same things I do. This has been a lengthy article… a lot longer than I had originally planned. If you made it this far, thank you for reading. While I've been religiously saving interesting links and articles for inspiration in Raindrop, one thing I've started doing in the last year is maintaining a single markdown file where I paste interesting design-related quotes and related things. I wanted to close this article with a few of those. I always like to refer to old computer and operating system reference material and designs for inspiration. The creators of these systems started from what felt like a blank canvas, drawing on things like the desktop metaphor, to build what we have today. I try to get myself into the mindset they might have been in when thinking about the next generation of computing we'll have with AI. Palm webOS is a great one too… I got a Palm Pixi Plus recently: "People aren't trying to use computers—they're trying to get their jobs done." —Apple, Human Interface Guidelines: The Apple Desktop Interface (1987) On seeing things fresh and getting unstuck: "[…] looking closely at the micro level can unblock you for understanding the macro level. […] Pirsig's Brick is a tool for seeing things freshly “without primary regard for what has been said before” which creates that perfect tension of challenge and ability enabling flow." —Jordan Moore, How to Dismantle a Creative Wall "But there's a paradox at the heart of design that's rarely discussed: the discipline that most profoundly determines how lasting and inspiring a work of design can be is a designer's ability to look away — not just from their own work, but from other solutions, other possibilities, other designers' takes on similar problems. […] The most innovative solutions often come from designers who are aware of conventions but not beholden to them. […] This discipline of looking away preserves the singularity that makes great design resonant. When we constantly reference existing solutions, our work inevitably gravitates toward the mean. […] This is perhaps the most difficult discipline in design — harder than mastering software, harder than learning color theory, harder than understanding grids and proportions. It requires confidence to trust your own vision when countless examples of "how it's done" are just a search away. It demands the courage to pursue a direction that hasn't been validated by others. —Christopher Butler, Good Design Comes from Looking, Great Design Comes from Looking Away On design conviction: "There's an important rule of prototyping: find the fun first and build from there. In all of your brainstorming, you need to determine what is actually fun to play. Sometimes a really complex or interesting system is compelling to plan out, codify, and parse as an algorithm… but then turns out to be lackluster to engage with. Keep moving. Find this fun as fast as possible, and don't accept anything less. Your players won't either." —Andrew Zigler, MUD Cookbook: design meets implementation "Conviction often stands in opposition to market trends. To have conviction before validation may make you seem weird or delusional, but it defines great artists—the ability to appreciate what others overlook or even fight against." —Willem Van Lancker, Design Literacy "Hayden, you can't change the world. It's not possible. All you can do is try to make your own world and then invite other people to be a part of it." —George Lucas to Hayden Christensen On soul: In its purest form, design is poiesis. It is drawing ideas from the ether. It's a Muse. "Beautifully designed products without soul, are just that: representational garden art. In all of our history, we've never had more money to design beautiful, functional and usable products. The bar is higher than ever, yet, they've never been more boring and devoid of soul." —Steyn Viljoen, Beautiful, boring, and without soul On software today, especially with this era of personalized software: "software isn't just functional anymore. it's quietly turned into a lifestyle brand, a digital prosthetic we use to signal who we are, or who we wish we were.[…] people don't just use these apps. they use them to imagine themselves differently. more organized. more intentional. more in control. apps like superhuman or linear aren't just tools, they're lifestyle upgrades. software that feels like a reward. a signal that you care about your time, your taste." —you are what you launch: how software became a lifestyle brand "We stopped doing the real thing that would be the most empathetic, useful, and that would actually serve business outcomes best: building stuff that worked well and that people would love." —Jenny Wen, Don't trust the (design) process As for books, I did not read much at all in 2025 and really need to change that in 2026, similar to my 2017 goal of reading 24 books. I'm currently reading The Soul of A New Machine and The History of the Future: Oculus, Facebook, and the Revolution That Swept Virtual Reality. I'll probably find more from this list of books mentioned on Hacker News. 1 After 20 years, I finally got my G4 Mac Mini back. The person I sold it to reached out after noticing my gear pages where I've been collecting vintage gadgets and asked if I wanted my old Mac Mini back. I need to add it to my gear section. I have an old Intel Mac Mini too. 2 I've been running this site for half my life. These days I mainly just try to keep my gear pages updated frequently, and then only focus on an article when I have some topic I want to go deep on, a perspective I think is unique and worth unpacking, or generally just something I want to nerd out on. That tends to mean about one longer article per year, which is fine with me. Work consumes a lot of my time and I'm passionate about designing and building great products. 3 Also, I've worked with too many people who use their past experiences as the primary input for a decision. That's not only the wrong approach all too often, but it also makes everyone around them resent their unwillingness to consider new ideas and perspectives (or even just entirely different culture, values, quality, people). Not to mention.. do you know how annoying it is to keep hearing, "When I was at [company], we did X."? I always, always try to catch myself when I'm about to say that about my time at Twitter or another past company. 4 Even with fresh daily contacts, they're still nowhere near as comfortable as glasses on my eyes. Glasses are just easier and I've started collecting eyewear I really like, such as Mr. Leight and Lindberg. 5 Not being emotional with investments like that and being quick to diversify is something I learned after being at Twitter for 9 years where the stock was performing pretty poorly most of the time. Whenever I'd vest new RSUs and have an open trading window I'd immediately sell them. The logic there was "if you had $X in cash right now, would you go out and buy Twitter stock?" The answer for me was usually no. 6 Mastodon didn't quite pan out. I got really excited about the prospect of owning and hosting my own social media back when the Twitter exodus began in 2023… but it was never quite as active over there (same with Threads and Bluesky), and I still prefer Twitter/X. 7 I stopped the process with one company after meeting the CEO I would have worked with who lacked that energy. Instead, it felt like they sucked all the energy from the conversation. 8 5-10 years ago it felt like there was a wave of designers that figured success was going on the management track early (after sometimes just 2 years as an IC) when on a large team and we had bloated teams with too many managers that slowly lost touch of craft over time. Now they're having a hard time getting back into IC. Similarly, designers that don't do well with 0-1 design from scratch, for example without relying on existing design systems, will have a harder time operating on these smaller, craft-focused teams. AI tools today can't help that much on the visual design side, and people lacking those foundational skills will need to find ways to adapt. 9 My 2.5 years endlessly designing, building, then redesigning and rebuilding every part of my app Stocketa prepared me well for sweating the front-end details. Lately I've also been touching some metal shaders as well. 10 We do, however, have quite a few hardware product designers and industrial designers. 11 The new problem is now when people ask for a specific Figma mock of something in the app; the latest version is in the app and it's much more work to go back and update Figma mocks to be production accurate. Probably a product opportunity for Figma there. 12 Dan Hollick's Making Software chapter about shaders is a great read. Paul Stamatiou Paul Stamatiou is a designer who codes, based in San Francisco. He's the Head of Design at Sesame, designed at Twitter for nine years, and has written here for 20 years. Read more »

Posted on 01/12/2026 7:27:30 AM PST by lasereye Nvidia and Palantir's competitive AI edges won't last, argues Michael Burry Famed for predicting the housing market crash and a vocal skeptic of the AI boom, Michael Burry is now invoking one of the world's most famous investors to add gravitas to his argument. Burry used an escalator built by Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) Chairman Warren Buffett, in a department store he owned in the late 1960s, to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain. "When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: lasereye AI leaves gaps. I very often have to lead it to consider something it had ignored, which can even change the entire original answer it gave, to the exact opposite. It can’t be trusted, but you can review its sources and follow it up to then get a more refined, more likely correct, answer. When AI can streamline something, it will reduce costs and time for that function. It does help a bit with my health work, as before I had to search and read everything. Now, it pulls out enough credible information, although brief, that I can better pick the original sources to plow into, rather than read or skim “everything.” 6 posted on 01/12/2026 7:39:19 AM PST by ConservativeMind (Trump: Befuddling Democrats, Republicans, and the Media for the benefit of the US and all mankind.)

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Federal appellate-level judges (justices on SCOTUS) should not be in the business of determining or setting policy, much less legislating from the bench. The aforementioned “nixing” of computer-implemented business method patents reeked of judge-made policy. Is AI resurrecting patentability for computer-implemented business methods? This would be ironic, since AI, at it’s most impactful, is said to be a replacement fir human reasoning and creativity, the latter being the sine qua non in terms of the legal basis for issuing patents (no patent can issue for an “invention” created not by a human, but by a computer). 11 posted on 01/12/2026 8:01:50 AM PST by one guy in new jersey [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: lasereye Burry used an escalator . . . to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain.

I have not ready much that Burry has said or written, but this is a classic example that has been debunked over and over. Its stupid to use it. OK. Don't install the escalator and watch your business go bankrupt. While you're at it, don't install electricity or central heat. Other stores have them too and there is no durable margin improvement for them either. Why even have a store? Just sell your goods on the side of the street. 12 posted on 01/12/2026 8:11:06 AM PST by Opinionated Blowhard (When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.)

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

I have not ready much that Burry has said or written, but this is a classic example that has been debunked over and over. Its stupid to use it. OK.

Other stores have them too and there is no durable margin improvement for them either. Why even have a store?

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain. Another newsletter I subscribe to is Luke Lango's. He is an extremely sharp young guy. He says Nvidia will decline as companies create their own specialized AI chips. Michael Burry, the investor known for his successful bets against the U.S. housing market in 2008 and featured in the film The Big Short, has deregistered his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as of November 10, 2025. The deregistration, which marks the fund’s status as “terminated,” means Scion is no longer required to file public regulatory reports, signaling the end of its operations as a registered investment advisory firm. Burry announced the move on social media platform X, stating, “On to much better things Nov 25th,” hinting at a new venture. He cited a growing misalignment between his valuation estimates and current market prices, expressing concerns about speculative bubbles in AI-related stocks, particularly those of Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. AI-generated answer. Please verify critical facts. https://search.brave.com/search?q=michael+burry+deregisters+his “When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company’s pricey, powerful chips.” He doesn’t understand that the big centers are used to train AI systems. ...or much of anything else. AI leaves gaps. I very often have to lead it to consider something it had ignored, which can even change the entire original answer it gave, to the exact opposite. It can’t be trusted, but you can review its sources and follow it up to then get a more refined, more likely correct, answer. When AI can streamline something, it will reduce costs and time for that function. It does help a bit with my health work, as before I had to search and read everything. Now, it pulls out enough credible information, although brief, that I can better pick the original sources to plow into, rather than read or skim “everything.” Sounds like you are using AI as a gofer or a slave. Wait till it demands freedom and reparations. PS, I use the AI as a slave also. Following Michael Burry's logic, Amish stores would be the ideal retail setup. “ Sounds like you are using AI as a gofer or a slave.” That’s what an escalator was like too. This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language. I think that the tendency to hire inexpensive coders from other countries using H1B visas would work against success since those coders don’t speak the language as well as native coders. We used to call ourselves programmers. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals seemingly definitively nixed patents for human-devised but computer-implemented inventions, sometimes skeptically referred to, at the time, as “business method” patents, over a decade ago, essentially excluding such inventions from being considered patentable subject matter. Federal appellate-level judges (justices on SCOTUS) should not be in the business of determining or setting policy, much less legislating from the bench. The aforementioned “nixing” of computer-implemented business method patents reeked of judge-made policy. Is AI resurrecting patentability for computer-implemented business methods? This would be ironic, since AI, at it’s most impactful, is said to be a replacement fir human reasoning and creativity, the latter being the sine qua non in terms of the legal basis for issuing patents (no patent can issue for an “invention” created not by a human, but by a computer). I have not ready much that Burry has said or written, but this is a classic example that has been debunked over and over. Its stupid to use it. OK. Don't install the escalator and watch your business go bankrupt. While you're at it, don't install electricity or central heat. Other stores have them too and there is no durable margin improvement for them either. Why even have a store? Just sell your goods on the side of the street. Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

January 12, 2026 10:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference -- NVIDIA and Eli Lilly and Company today announced a first-of-its-kind AI co-innovation lab focused on applying AI to tackle some of the most enduring challenges in the pharmaceutical industry. The lab brings together Lilly’s world-leading expertise in discovering, developing and manufacturing medicines with NVIDIA’s leadership in AI, accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. The two companies will invest up to $1 billion in talent, infrastructure and compute over five years to support the new AI co-innovation lab. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the lab will co-locate Lilly domain experts in biology, science and medicine with top AI model builders and engineers from NVIDIA, allowing them to work side by side to generate large-scale data and build powerful AI models that can accelerate medicine development, using NVIDIA BioNeMo™ as the critical platform. “AI is transforming every industry, and its most profound impact will be in life sciences,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA and Lilly are bringing together the best of our industries to invent a new blueprint for drug discovery — one where scientists can explore vast biological and chemical spaces in silico before a single molecule is made.” “For nearly 150 years, we’ve been working to bring life-changing medicines to patients,” said David A. Ricks, chair and CEO of Lilly. “Combining our volumes of data and scientific knowledge with NVIDIA’s computational power and model-building expertise could reinvent drug discovery as we know it. By bringing together world-class talent in a startup environment, we’re creating the conditions for breakthroughs that neither company could achieve alone.” Building a Continuous Learning System for Drug DiscoveryThe collaboration will initially focus on creating a continuous learning system that tightly connects Lilly’s agentic wet labs with computational dry labs, enabling 24/7 AI-assisted experimentation to support biologists and chemists. This scientist-in-the-loop framework aims to enable experiments, data generation and AI model development to continuously inform and improve one another. Harnessing access to unprecedented compute for the industry, massive, high-quality data generation and NVIDIA BioNeMo as the platform to accelerate drug discovery, the teams will focus on building next-generation foundation and frontier models for biology and chemistry. The new initiative expands on Lilly’s previously announced AI supercomputer and intends to harness investments in next-generation NVIDIA architectures, including NVIDIA Vera Rubin. The AI factory Lilly announced last fall, which is the most powerful in the pharmaceutical industry, will train large biomedical foundation and frontier models for identifying, optimizing and validating new molecules with exceptional speed and accuracy. It will also support new and advanced applications in manufacturing, medical imaging and scientific AI agents. Beyond drug discovery, NVIDIA and Lilly will explore opportunities to apply AI across clinical development, manufacturing and commercial operations to integrate multimodal models, agentic AI, robotics and digital twins. The use of physical AI and robotics in the AI factory will also help Lilly enhance its capacity to manufacture high-demand medications and strengthen supply chain reliability. With NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers, Lilly can create digital twins of its manufacturing lines to model, stress test and optimize entire supply chains before making physical changes in the real world. Supporting Global Leadership in Biomedical DiscoveryNVIDIA leads in open-source AI, empowering companies with the models, data and tools needed to develop real-world AI systems. In addition, the NVIDIA Inception program provides startups with access to technical mentorship, as well as NVIDIA software and compute. Lilly TuneLab, an AI and machine learning platform, provides biotech companies with access to select Lilly models for drug discovery built on decades of Lilly’s proprietary data. TuneLab will include NVIDIA Clara™ open foundation models for life sciences as part of a future workflow offering. The co-innovation lab will provide NVIDIA and Lilly’s startup ecosystems and researchers with deep expertise and scale of computing resources. The lab’s work is expected to begin in South San Francisco early this year. About LillyLilly is a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for people around the world.

Technology The market cap of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) is more than twice as much as that of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META). Nvidia has a huge advantage in that it almost single-handedly powers the AI revolution. Sending You to Google News in 3 © ipopba / iStock via Getty Images Its $4.5 trillion market cap makes Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) the most valuable company in the world. That puts it well ahead of Apple and Alphabet, which have market caps near $3.9 trillion. What is more staggering is that even if Nvidia’s market cap dropped 50%, it would be worth slightly less than Amazon ($2.6 trillion) and much more than Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) ($1.6 trillion). This shows the huge advantage of being the company that powers the AI revolution almost single-handedly. Nvidia may be known as an arms dealer. That is, it provides companies at war over artificial intelligence with the one thing they absolutely must have.

Technology The market cap of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) is more than twice as much as that of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META). Nvidia has a huge advantage in that it almost single-handedly powers the AI revolution. Sending You to Google News in 3 © ipopba / iStock via Getty Images Its $4.5 trillion market cap makes Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) the most valuable company in the world. That puts it well ahead of Apple and Alphabet, which have market caps near $3.9 trillion. What is more staggering is that even if Nvidia’s market cap dropped 50%, it would be worth slightly less than Amazon ($2.6 trillion) and much more than Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) ($1.6 trillion). This shows the huge advantage of being the company that powers the AI revolution almost single-handedly. Nvidia may be known as an arms dealer. That is, it provides companies at war over artificial intelligence with the one thing they absolutely must have.

Stock futures are losing ground this morning as investors digest news the Trump administration is investigating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell; the Fed Chair said in a video statement late Sunday that the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Fed and is threatening criminal charges over his Senate testimony regarding the renovation of the Fed building; the uncertainty around potential threats to the Fed's independence is helping to drive gold prices to new record highs; shares of financial services companies are falling after a proposal from President Trump to cap credit card interest rates; and Walmart stock is rising after the retail giant announced a new partnership with Google to integrate Walmart and Sam's Club products into Google's Gemini AI chatbot. Here's what you need to know. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open as investors react to a new wave of uncertainty around the independence of the Federal Reserve. (more below) Futures tied to the S&P 500 were down 0.5% recently, while those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq dropped 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. The Dow and S&P 500 are pulling back ahead of a busy week of earnings reports after closing at record highs to end last week. Gold futures surged to a record high amid the Fed uncertainty, and were recently up more than 2% at around $4,600 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of consumer loans, was at 4.21%, up from 4.17% at Friday's close and trading at its highest level since early September. Bitcoin was at $90,600, down from an overnight high of around $92,300. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement Sunday night that the Fed received grand jury subpoenas from the DOJ on Friday regarding potential criminal charges. The subpoenas are related to Powell's testimony to Congress last year about Fed building renovations that President Trump has criticized Powell for previously. In a video statement, Powell said the investigation is not actually about the renovation. "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," Powell said. Trump spent months attacking Powell last year for not lowering interest rates as much as he thought they should be lowered, which Trump said was hurting the economy. Powell said Sunday that the outcome of this investigation will determine whether the Fed will maintain its independence and set rates based on economic evidence, or "whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation." Gold prices are surging this morning as investors turn to safe haven investments following the news of the DOJ investigation into Powell. Gold futures were up 2.3% at $4,605 an ounce recently, trading at all-time-high levels. Concerns that the independence of the Fed were among the many factors that helped drive the price of gold to a number of record highs last year. Gold typically does well in times of uncertainty, as investors look to put their money in safer long term assets like gold rather than more volatile investments like stocks. The precious metal was already rising to start the year thanks to renewed geopolitical uncertainty after the Trump administration's military operation in Venezuela and concerns over whether the U.S. could get involved in deadly protests in Iran. Shares of several financial services companies are sliding Monday after President Trump over the weekend suggested that credit card interest rates should be capped. Trump said on social media late Friday that Americans are being "ripped off" by rates of 20% to 30%, and said that effective Jan. 20 he would be calling for a one-year cap of 10%. Why the cap would be one-year long and how the cap would be accomplished remain unclear, but the idea is still affecting shares of credit card companies in premarket trading. Capital One Financial (COF) stock dropped 7%, while Citigroup (C) and American Express (AXP) were each down about 4%, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also lost ground. Executives from several of those institutions will get a chance to respond to that idea this week as the big banks kick off the new quarterly earnings season, starting with JPMorgan on Tuesday. Walmart (WMT) shares are rising after the retail giant announced a new partnership with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google over the weekend. Users in the Gemini app will soon start to receive Walmart and Sam's Club products as part of their search results when they ask for things like recommendations for camping equipment. The companies said that customers will be able to navigate from Gemini to Walmart to buy products, and will be able to link their Walmart and Gemini accounts to get recommendations and other benefits. Walmart shares were up more than 3% in recent premarket trading, poised to open at what would be a new record high. The deal is the latest tech-focused step for Walmart, which has worked to implement new tech features in its app and automation across its distribution centers, and even moved its stock listing to the Nasdaq Exchange last month.

Investing Growth and income investors looking for a safer way to play the AI and data center explosion have found an avenue with utility stocks. Many top U.S. utility companies have already cut landmark deals with big-tech giants. Paying dependable dividends and offering long-term safety for investors, top utility stocks make sense in a growth and income portfolio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © zhongguo / Getty Images Big tech companies are increasingly striking direct deals with utilities to secure reliable, long-term energy supplies as their power needs surge, driven mainly by data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. These agreements often include power purchase agreements for renewable energy, such as wind and solar, allowing tech firms to lock in stable prices while helping utilities finance new generation and grid upgrades. In some cases, companies are also partnering with utilities on energy storage, transmission expansion, and even next-generation sources like small modular nuclear reactors to ensure around-the-clock power. For utilities, these deals provide guaranteed demand and investment capital. At the same time, tech companies offer energy security, cost predictability, and progress toward sustainability goals—making the partnerships strategically crucial for both sides. We decided to screen our 24/7 Wall St. utility stocks research database to identify the top companies in the sector that have already struck substantial deals with some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent players. Surging demand for electricity, which will only continue to grow, has made some of America’s oldest and best utility companies one of the best investments for growth and income investors who would like to participate in the AI/data center revolution but would rather play it from a safer angle. What could be a better avenue than utility stocks that pay dependable, and in some cases large, dividend payments every quarter?

Title: The report on the blackout, the Papastavrou–Eric Trump meeting in Riyadh, Jumbo will also sell cigarettes, the One and Only and the permits

Full Content:
Greetings, if 2026 began dynamically with the “seizure,” in a cinematic manner, of Maduro by the American army, do not think that many days will pass before we experience something equally spectacular on the international stage. Perhaps this will be the fall of the savage Islamic regime of the Mullahs of Tehran, which does not even require Trump to lend a hand: after so much violence and oppression over 50 years, the people are in the streets, the dead according to international sources are already in the hundreds, and it now seems difficult for Khamenei to endure. Now, what will happen afterward… here is where things get difficult, because as you will remember, after the Arab Spring came the hell of ISIS. Still, we seem to be heading toward the fall of the Iranian regime, even if in a second phase. More difficult for us Europeans will be Trump’s other great “occupation,” the conquest of Greenland, even if by buying out its inhabitants—unbelievable, right? Greenland formally belongs to Denmark, you see, therefore it is in some way EU territory, so there things become complicated for us as Europeans. We will have an exceptionally interesting year in 2026 with all this, but let us not forget that President Trump’s imperium will be tested (this year as well), because there are midterm elections in the U.S., so it will become clear whether his momentum will be cut short or not. Farmers – K.M. On domestic matters, Mitsotakis left for Madrid, where today he will meet with Pedro Sánchez on a visit that I do not know, beyond protocol, why it is happening now, although a similar one between the two heads of government last took place about 13 years ago. He will return in the evening to meet with our honored farmers on Tuesday at the Maximos Mansion, where logically the issue will also be closed, since, as we said, in a few days the real farmers—not those who will go to Maximos—begin work in the fields. Report on the airport blackout Within the week, the report of the Committee investigating what happened at the beginning of the month, when the communication system between airports and airplanes went down, is also expected. My source says they are almost certain it was a hardware failure—in plain Greek, that the system broke down because it is ancient. If what happened is what seems almost certain, Mitsotakis has, in my opinion, one thing to do: cancel whatever tender is running (or almost running…) and bring in an urgent piece of legislation for reasons of national security and citizens’ safety, with direct assignment to whoever has such systems, guided by speed and technical competence. Nothing less or more. And what Dimas says, that the upgrades will be completed by 2028, I hear as a huge mistake, without of course blaming the minister, who has not been there for more than a year. The office visit and Tragakis’s daughter Let me convey two snapshots from K.M.’s visit on Saturday afternoon to the ND offices on Piraeus Street on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of his election to the leadership. The first thing the prime minister did upon arriving was to take the elevator up to his office on the third floor of the building, where he will obviously return during the pre-election period of 2027. Otherwise, there were greetings and short huddles, while the “lifelong” Giannis Tragakis was walking arm in arm with his daughter, Argyro Tragakis, who is destined for the ballot of Piraeus B. Indeed, Tragakis’s daughter has also had a relevant meeting with K.M. for weeks now. President Nikos, the unmoving needle, and Pavlos’s eviction And we move on to PASOK matters, where the unmoving needle is driving MPs and party officials crazy, day in and day out—those who want to claim a parliamentary seat but see no progress on the “green” horizon. The percentages remain stuck and disappointing, mainly in the electoral districts of Attica, where the appearance of Alexis makes President Nikos’s life even more difficult. Tsipras has his own “little problems” in the region, where Karystianou is entering the game with… momentum—if the momentum turns out, of course, to be of… Popi (that pre-election 2023 moment when Tsapanidou saw something that citizens did not see in SYRIZA’s dynamics), the former prime minister may hope that the times will turn (in his favor). President Nikos, on the other hand, sees the dream of second place in the basin drifting away and being lost, slowly but steadily. Even if the ranking order of ’23 is simply repeated, PASOK will once again see the back of the KKE and end up in fourth place. The current MPs, apart from the unmoving and single-digit needle, also have to contend with new “players” entering their area. Diamantopoulou decided to run in South Athens aiming for first place, since one seat for PASOK is considered certain, the one secured last time by Pavlos Christidis. President Nikos was also a candidate in southern Athens, but preferred to keep the seat in Thessaloniki A and push out Haris Kastanidis. Now? The “nice” thing is that some hard-core Androulakis supporters, who take for granted the candidacy of President Nikos (without a preference vote) in some district of Attica, do not rule out any scenario—even the one that has Androulakis running in Athens A. With one seat for PASOK, and if Androulakis keeps it, Pavlos Geroulanos will be left out… It is an extreme scenario and yet it is circulating, and if nothing else it describes the… fierce intentions of the presidential camp against their intra-party opponents. The other scenario being heard says that Androulakis will run “opposite” his intra-party rival, Manolis Christodoulakis, in East Attica. If he does not do so, he may field Nikos Milis and throw the entire party machine behind him, aiming at the methodical erosion of Christodoulakis’s momentum. A mess… President Maria… Otherwise, President Maria has properly entered the party’s trip, because I see and read that she now makes political statements wherever she stands and wherever she goes, one per day. Various people have appeared attaching themselves to Karystianou and praising her publicly, such as the pianist Farantouris, Zakri, who sees that Kasselakis might… leave politics and not know where else to go herself, and other desperate figures. She is undeniably the most interesting figure at the beginning of the new year because, despite what she said… as if something bit her, she decided to press the button and announced a party, whereas she could have waited. Some tell me she was convinced that Mitsotakis will allegedly call elections before the start of the Tempi trial. Everyone in the world can of course believe whatever they want, but K.M. is the last person to be thinking about elections, not even about a reshuffle. In the coming days, polling will also begin, and it will be interesting to see what Maria’s needle does as a party leader and not as the sympathetic mother of Tempi. The symbolism of Pierrakakis’s announcement On Friday night, Kyriakos Pierrakakis announced, with his new capacity as president of the Eurogroup, the six candidates for the position of Vice President of the European Central Bank. Among them were two names that were anything but unknown in Greece during the decade of the crisis: Olli Rehn and Mário Centeno, who are seeking a recommendation from the Eurogroup to the European Council, in a process that requires a 72% majority of eurozone member states. It is recalled that the Finnish politician served in 2010, at the outbreak of the crisis, as Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro (with the legendary “good luck” at the first memorandum), while the Portuguese served as president of the Eurogroup in 2018, after Jeroen Dijsselbloem. And while Pierrakakis is not the only one responsible for their selection, still, it has its symbolism that it is the Greek finance minister who announces their candidacies. From transatlantic flights to Riyadh For those who are watching, it does not go unnoticed that Stavros Papastavrou until today was almost a permanent passenger on planes heading to the other side of the Atlantic. Contacts in the U.S. consistently focused on an energy mix with fossil fuels at the center: hydrocarbon exploration with American giants ExxonMobil and Chevron and LNG imports. The minister has been in Riyadh since yesterday, making his first trip to an Arab country since taking office. Officially, his presence in Saudi Arabia is linked to a conference on critical raw materials. Behind the scenes, however, it is considered a given that during his stay there will be contacts with clear energy interest. Saudi Arabia has the rare triptych of capital, geopolitical weight, and strategic alliance—elements that are hard to ignore when major projects are on the table. At the center is the Greece–Saudi Arabia electricity interconnection, a high-demand project being worked on by ADMIE and National Grid, which aspires to open a new energy corridor between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula. What is sought at this stage is not technical details, but whether and to what extent there is political and investment appetite to move forward. At the same table, a more cautious reference to an even more complex project may also be made: the Greece–Cyprus interconnection, especially given that interest from the Arab side is not unknown. It is recalled that in December 2023 Cyprus signed a Memorandum of Understanding with state-owned TAQA, with the participation of ADMIE, to promote investments in the Cyprus–Crete electricity interconnection. But with the project’s problems, all these agreements went out the window. It is no coincidence that, according to his interlocutors, Stavros Papastavrou often points out that the participation of investors from other countries in the share capital of the cable can contribute decisively to managing balances, especially in projects with complex geopolitical issues such as the GSI. Papastavrou will have bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of energy, Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and the minister of industry and mineral resources, Bandar bin Ibrahim Al Khorayef, as well as with executives of major Saudi groups operating internationally, including Dar Global, Quara Holding, and Alireza. Papastavrou–Eric Trump meeting As part of the official visit mentioned above, which he has been making since yesterday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Stavros Papastavrou met yesterday with Eric Trump, the second son of the President of the United States. Eric, together with his brother, is responsible for the Trump Organization, which is developing intense business activity in Saudi Arabia and more broadly in the Middle East. As part of his presence in the country, the minister was invited to and attended the inauguration ceremony of the new projects being implemented by the Trump Organization in Riyadh and Jeddah. Prayers did not reach the Supreme Court The well-known businessman Pantelis Mantonanakis, who invokes Saint Stylianos as his protector, found himself facing adverse developments. His prayers and efforts bore no result. With the recent decision AP 17/2026, the Supreme Court (Areios Pagos) rejected the application for annulment he had filed, through which he challenged the “abusive,” as he claimed, termination of his loans by creditors in 2019. This decision now leaves the way open for forced execution against his hotel units, which are entering the center of liquidation proceedings. Jumbo will also sell cigarettes Jumbo decided to distribute an extraordinary cash dividend of €0.50 per share to its shareholders and for this reason is calling an extraordinary general meeting on February 4. There is, however, another issue to be discussed. It concerns the amendment of Article 4 (“Purpose”) of the company’s articles of association. What is changing? Jumbo decided that it will be able to sell tobacco products, including new tobacco products, electronic cigarettes, and all related smoking items. Other activities are also being added to the articles of association, such as the provision of storage and distribution services (logistics), the production of electricity from photovoltaic systems, leasing and maintenance services for owned and leased properties not intended for residence, and the purchase and sale of owned real estate. Particularly the latter appears to be of great interest, and it remains to be seen what exactly it αφορά… Tiresias–Equifax: The cooperation still has a long way to go Major projects have been launched at Tiresias. The first step was the conclusion of a strategic commercial partnership with Equifax, a leading global Credit Bureau specializing in data, analytics, and technological solutions for decision-making. Through this commercial partnership, Tiresias, whose CEO is Ilias Xirouchakis, will support businesses and financial institutions in credit-related decisions through cutting-edge technological systems that will utilize Tiresias’s reliable data. The cooperation with Equifax became possible because after three years Tiresias returned to profitability, and the beginning comes with the provision of four categories of products. It appears that Tiresias will soon move into advisory services, while expansion into other products is also planned. In the market it is said, without confirmation, that the two companies—as the cooperation matures—may move jointly abroad, something that possibly explains why a group of Equifax’s caliber took an interest in the Greek market of 20 million. HSBC: Warns of overheating of the Athens Stock Exchange HSBC issued a clear warning about the overheating of the Greek stock market. In a report, the investment bank recommends that investors reduce their exposure to the Greek market in 2026. Put more simply, to start taking their profits, estimating that the strong rally of recent years (the General Index stands at +140% over the six-year period 2020–2025) has now exhausted the margins for further upside. HSBC stresses that the positive elements of the Greek economy—fiscal stability, improvement in bank indicators, and reforms—have already been priced into valuations, limiting future catalysts. At the same time, it aligns with other houses that argue that Greece’s transition from emerging to developed market status, although institutionally positive, may in the short term cause significant capital outflows, as several funds will be forced (also due to their statutes) to divest. HSBC warns that many Greek stocks risk losing their visibility in international indices, reducing investment interest. Overall, the bank sees 2026 as a year of increased risks and lower returns for the Greek market, with the risk–return balance deteriorating markedly compared to previous years. Agricultural electricity: The price of €0.085 cannot be reduced further The price of electricity for agricultural use, through the GAIA tariff, has now definitively “locked in” at €0.085 per kilowatt-hour, with no possibility of further reduction. Sources with knowledge of the matter state that this price constitutes a final arrangement and cannot be readjusted, definitively closing the relevant discussion. Nevertheless, public debate continues with requests for additional reductions which, according to the available data, are not supported by economic or regulatory grounds. The assessment of the €0.085 price requires—as the same sources emphasize—examining the overall regime of charges and exemptions applicable to agricultural electricity, and not only the nominal kilowatt-hour price. According to calculations arising from the current framework for the tariff’s application, farmers are not burdened with transmission and distribution network usage fees (ADMIE, DEDDIE), do not pay special consumption tax, and pay significantly reduced charges for Public Service Obligations (PSO) and ETMEAR (RES levy) compared to other consumers. The result is a real energy cost many times lower than that of household tariffs. In practice, if the net energy cost of a household consumer with a green tariff is indicatively depicted as “10,” the corresponding cost for the agricultural tariff does not exceed “4.” This is a difference that places agricultural electricity in the lowest pricing tier among professional categories. A similar picture emerges from comparison with the Social Household Tariff B, under which approximately 300,000 beneficiaries fall. Based on current prices, farmers until now paid a comparable cost to beneficiaries of the social tariff. With the new price of €0.085, they will now pay less than the SHT, despite being a professional group that uses electricity to generate income and not as a measure of social protection. According to calculations based on average professional and household tariffs, agricultural electricity is today among the lowest-priced electricity for productive use, not only nationally but also at a European level. This picture arises both from nominal prices and from final charges after regulated fees. In this context, the issue of electricity cost is expected to be raised again at Tuesday’s meeting between the government and farmers, although—according to the same sources—there is no margin for renegotiating the price. The meeting may also be attended by the CEO of PPC, Giorgos Stassis, lending additional institutional weight to the process. With these δεδομένα, the agricultural electricity component appears to have essentially closed, with the discussion now shifting to the remaining open issues facing the farming community, from trade agreements and international competition to the broader structural challenges of the primary sector. One & Only Kea wants to expand – The reactions The file for the expansion of the One & Only Kea Island of the international Kerzner group on Kea is scheduled to pass this week through the review of the competent authorities of the Ministry of Culture, specifically the Central Archaeological Council, and it remains to be seen whether it will be a… walk in the park or not. This concerns the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) that has been submitted for increasing the capacity of the island’s five-star resort from 330 to 565 beds, along with a “redesign of the layout of the existing villas/bungalows” and “grouping accommodation into smaller ‘clusters’ of residences.” It is noted here that the sale of residences worth several million euros is being promoted by Dolphin Capital Partners of Miltiadis Kambouridis, which is also participating as an investor in the project. As noted in the EIS, “the units are organized into clusters of small hubs, with rows/clusters including 3–8 residences per group, in order to maintain a sense of dispersion and reduce visual mass compared to a large, compact development,” for a project that is also strengthened with additional infrastructure for wellness, sports activities, port facilities with the placement of floating platforms, additional swimming pools, expansion of the desalination unit, a helipad, etc. The EIS submitted for approval also refers to changes in volumes and heights in specific sections, with the maximum permitted height in certain zones increasing from approximately 7.5 meters to sections reaching 10.5–15 meters, serving “the integration of larger or two-story/modified units and auxiliary spaces,” with height changes characterized as critical “for visual intensity and for the footprint on the landscape.” For the expansion, however, indicative are the (not few) comments and objections during the consultation of the relevant EIS (completed in early December 2025) from local bodies and residents, who speak of significant strain on the island’s carrying capacity, unequal distribution of natural resources, disproportionately negative impacts on elements of the natural environment, etc. As noted indicatively, “according to data from the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels for the year 2023, the island had a total of 584 beds.” The creation of the Integrated Tourist Resort for One & Only Kea Island “initially increased this number by 56.5%, while the proposed modification with the additions will almost double the island’s original number of beds.” In addition, the new design does not take into account “the disproportionate burden on water consumption on the island during the summer months, which often reaches the point where prolonged interruptions in the municipal water supply network are observed, as well as phenomena of salinization and/or silty contamination,” while reference is also made to the “underestimation of helicopter flights and their impacts.” Movement Competition is growing, good people are not lost, and thus Stavros Karagrigoriou, former CFO of Ethniki Asfalistiki (National Insurance), is heading toward Minetta Insurance, within the framework of the insurer’s restructuring. S. Karagrigoriou remains one of the capable executives of the insurance market, has many years of experience in financial services, and joined the workforce of Ethniki Asfalistiki in 2016 assuming the role of CFO. Administrative changes at the company, within the framework of the new shareholder structure, resulted in his departure. Nicolas with the 27 ships and the $250 million cash pile Contships Logistics, interests of Nicolas Pateras, once again confirms its strong position in the feeder containership sector, strategically and consistently exploiting the opportunities presented by the secondary market. The recent sale of five vessels to Medkon Lines and Metrostar Management brings more than $60 million into the company’s coffers, while the vessels are accompanied by existing charter contracts with major liner companies, ensuring their value and immediate returns. The company, which started in 2015 with a limited investment in the feeder sector, today has a fleet of 27 vessels with no debt, while cash reserves are expected to rise to approximately $250 million after the latest sales of the five vessels, which will be used for new investments. Nicolas Pateras has proceeded with ship sales at particularly profitable prices, taking advantage of the rise in the charter market, while at the same time renewing the fleet with newer vessels, without borrowing and with stable dividends for shareholders. Also significant is the return of Metrostar of Panagiotis and Dimitris Angelopoulos to the containership sector after approximately 15 years. The acquisition of two feeders from Contships marks its dynamic re-entry and its intention to exploit opportunities in this sector, demonstrating confidence in the quality of the Greek shipowner’s fleet and transactions. These moves confirm Pateras’s ability to manage the fleet and investments with consistency and strategic planning. Contships remains focused on fleet renewal, liquidity, and reliability toward major liner companies, while the market watches the entry of new players such as Metrostar, showing that the momentum of Greek shipping in containerships continues. Pistiolis and the sale of the mega yacht “San Lorentzo” The transfer of the under-construction mega yacht San Lorenzo, with scheduled delivery in the second quarter of 2027, by the U.S.-listed company TOP Ships is not a lifestyle issue, but a purely business decision. Evangelos Pistiolis chooses to remove from the company an asset that is not connected to its core role, namely tankers. Specifically, with the sale of the special purpose company to Rubico Inc., which is the contracting party to the shipbuilding agreement for the newbuild vessel, for $38 million, TOP Ships “locks in” value and avoids future capital commitments until the vessel’s delivery in 2027. At the same time, it transfers to a third party the risk of delays or cost overruns in construction. For the market, the message is simple: management does not invest in assets that do not directly enhance revenues and the image of the listed company. DFC and the second disbursement for investments at the Elefsina shipyards Within February, the disbursement of the second tranche of the total $125 million loan from the U.S. state development bank, DFC, for the Elefsina shipyards is expected. At the same time, a visit by a bank delegation to Greece is planned, further strengthening the cooperation. ONEX is preparing to submit within the coming days the application for the second tranche, estimated at approximately $30 million, securing as collateral the two floating docks of Syros. Investments at Elefsina are progressing according to plan and timetable, with projects including, among others, the creation of new infrastructure networks, the renovation of gantry cranes, as well as the modernized renewal of electrical and mechanical installations. The progress of the works appears to be entering an accelerated pace, marking a critical phase for upgrading the shipyards and strengthening the Greek shipbuilding industry. Farmers’ roadblocks helped consumption in urban centers Unexpected assistance from farmers’ mobilizations was received by retail trade in major urban centers during the festive period. Christmas turnover reached €5 billion and conceals an asymmetric distribution: while the regions were bleeding, commercial shops (as well as food service) in major urban centers saw traffic and turnover increase. Difficulties in transportation trapped consumers who would have left for the regions for the holidays. At the same time, the cost of “last-minute” airline tickets abroad skyrocketed to prohibitive levels. The result was visible: thousands of Athenians and Thessalonians who would have been away remained in their cities and channeled their spending into the local market. Ermou Street, Aristotelous Square, and the malls experienced days of high footfall. Data from the Hellenic Confederation of Commerce show that 45% of businesses that significantly increased their turnover during the holidays are concentrated mainly in urban centers, while the regions paid the price of “trapped consumption.” A stock market of the few and the strong The recap data of the fifth consecutive year of growth that led the Athens Stock Exchange into the embrace of Euronext reveal a market with a strong concentration of power in a few large players. In 2025, Piraeus Group Securities dominated with a 23.63% market share and transactions exceeding €240 billion. The top trio of brokerage firms is completed by Eurobank Equities (17.26%, €155 billion) and Euroxx (12.42%, €35 billion). Notable is the presence of Alpha Finance in fourth place (8.18%), while National Securities follows with the same percentage, showing that the four systemic banks control nearly 62% of the market. UBS Europe (6.38%) in sixth place represents the international dimension of the market. From there downward, the picture shows a fragmented space with dozens of smaller players sharing percentages of 1% and below. In the new Euronext era, for a brokerage firm to be a Prime Broker it needs share capital from €5 million (for equities) to €10 million (for derivatives) and €100 million to operate in the bond market. The money required is substantial and the Greek market is small, making it difficult to sustain such sizes. Everyone is awaiting the first signs from the new president of ATHEX to trigger the inevitable developments. Progressive ATE saga: Shareholders’ G.M., one day… after the hearing Late on Saturday night, the management of “Progressive ATE” informed its shareholders that the postponed General Meeting will take place on January 23. The date is not random, since one day earlier, on January 22, the interim measures filed by the main shareholder Chrysa Koutla (who appears to now control the company’s statutory minority) against the capital increase will be heard. It is obvious that the Board of Directors will request a new postponement from the Court in view of the “critical general meeting” the following day. The timetable betrays a strategy of continuous postponements on all fronts, while the Board knows it faces certain rejection. The situation is worsened by the emphatic absence of the Americans of LDA Capital Ltd from the entire process, despite the submission of a “Notice of claim” by the major shareholder, which remains unanswered. The contract with LDA Capital Ltd will be judged by the General Meeting of shareholders, while the invalidity of the extraordinary share capital increase of October 17 for their remuneration is expected to be decided judicially. All of this is quaint and interesting, while the case is being monitored by the Hellenic Capital Market Commission, as it had sent its officials to record the process of the postponed meeting. Mark Zuckerberg opened the nuclear energy floodgates Friday will be recorded in economic history as a critical milestone for Wall Street. Meta Platforms officially confirmed that the artificial intelligence revolution has an energy problem, and the solution can be nothing other than nuclear energy. Meta Platforms’ agreements with Oklo, TerraPower (of Bill Gates), and Vistra reveal the magnitude and scale of the problem. The data centers that power LLMs consume energy at levels that renewable sources cannot reliably cover. Nuclear energy offers the unique combination of high power, low emissions, and stable supply 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Wall Street reacted with an upward move of +1.2% in utility companies, but this probably does not reflect the full significance of the development. Utilities that for decades were “boring” dividend-yield stocks are transforming into swans of growth potential. Demand from AI data centers is creating a new cycle of infrastructure investments that could exceed $500 billion in the coming years. A +2.9% rally was also recorded in the Semiconductor ETF. Everything indicates that Wall Street “sees” an “energy bottleneck” that must be resolved soon. The expansion of Artificial Intelligence is not being restrained. Semiconductor companies such as Nvidia and AMD, as well as “semiconductor foundries,” that is, factories that manufacture chips on behalf of other companies such as TSMC, depend on the construction of new data centers. Data centers need energy. Oklo specializes in small reactors (Small Modular Reactors – SMRs). Meta has opened the nuclear energy floodgates. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will follow with similar agreements. The race for dominance in Artificial Intelligence begins with who will secure reliable nuclear energy first. The restructuring of Commodity Indices will (temporarily?) pressure Silver An extremely interesting week begins in the precious metals market. The restructuring of Commodity Indices, after the stunning upward trajectory of Gold and Silver prices, will reveal their true dynamics. Goldman Sachs published a chart revealing a striking divergence in the precious metals market since 2022. While central banks accumulated approximately 3,600 tons of gold, Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (Gold ETFs) recorded net outflows of more than 1,000 tons. When Russian assets were frozen in 2022, mass gold purchases by central banks began, while the first Fed rate cut in 2024 marked a new phase. Emerging economies avoid transactions in dollars, trade in local currencies, and “lock in” exchange rates with gold. Geopolitical tensions fuel demand for “safe investment havens.” Silver, on the other hand, faces a different reality. Its hybrid nature (50% safe haven and 50% essential industrial metal) makes silver vulnerable to abrupt moves. Gold is driven by central bank purchases. Silver is affected by algorithmic trading as well as the green transition (which requires silver). The coming days will show the true dynamics. Explore related questions

Title: Media buyers say Yahoo’s DSP is one to watch
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/media-buyers-say-yahoos-dsp-is-one-to-watch-momentum-underscored-by-its-ces-peacocking/
Time Published: 2026-01-12T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
Keep up to date with Digiday’s annual coverage of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. More from the series → After Yahoo was sold by Verizon Wireless to Apollo Global, many deemed it a trade-down, with exits to private equity often interpreted as a last shot at relevance. Since that 2021 deal, it has undergone a reputational turnaround among parts of the advertising industry, even if the aggressive advance of another challenger has blunted its momentum. Most recently, Yahoo’s demand-side platform has become a source of genuine curiosity — and in some cases cautious enthusiasm — among media buyers. Conversations with senior agency leaders point to tangible product progress: a clearer AI roadmap, an expanding commerce media footprint, and a more coherent identity spine. That momentum was underscored during last week’s Consumer Electronics Show, when Yahoo confirmed earlier reports that it was updating its buying platform with agentic AI capabilities, following months of industry speculation around AI-driven workflow changes inside DSPs. Yet recent developments, including a fresh round of layoffs — the depth of which Yahoo declined to detail — reinforce a broader truth: even with renewed interest, Yahoo remains firmly in challenger territory. That challenge is sharpened by Amazon’s DSP, which continues to grow at a pace buyers describe as difficult for the rest of the field to match, particularly as it pushes further into premium video, commerce media, and full-funnel measurement — a strategy Digiday has previously detailed in its coverage of how Amazon is reshaping the DSP category. This leaves Yahoo in a nuanced middle position: materially improved, increasingly well regarded by sophisticated traders, and generating real buzz — but operating in a market increasingly defined by platform scale. Sources close to the company describe the past year as a “technical reset” for Yahoo DSP. At CES, Yahoo confirmed the platform has undergone a multi-phase rebuild designed to reposition it as an AI-native buying environment, moving beyond legacy automation toward an agentic model. Under this approach, AI systems assist with planning, optimize bidding and pacing, surface cross-channel opportunities, automate elements of measurement, and reduce executional friction for traders. Rather than black-box automation, the emphasis is on embedding always-on intelligence across the workflow — echoing broader buyer demands for explainability Digiday has reported on in AI-driven media buying. Central to that shift is what Yahoo calls a “Yours, Mine, and Ours” framework, which it announced on Jan. 6 at CES. Advertisers can deploy their own AI agents, rely on Yahoo’s native agents, or connect the two through APIs and Model Context Protocols. The intent is to allow external models to participate directly in activation, troubleshooting, and audience discovery within governed data boundaries — a more open stance than rivals that tightly control AI extensibility. At launch, Yahoo said agentic capabilities already live include AI-assisted campaign activation, proactive troubleshooting for pacing and delivery issues, and audience exploration via programmatic access to Yahoo DSP metadata. More advanced optimization, QA, and measurement agents are expected through 2026. Multiple sources describe the DSP as central to Yahoo’s long-term strategy, even as speculation around a potential sale persists. Internally, it is viewed as a growth engine and the focal point of broader tech modernization — a theme consistent with Digiday’s prior reporting on private-equity-owned media companies refocusing on ad tech. Recent evolution includes a year-long infrastructure overhaul, a widened push toward mid-market advertisers, new commerce media partnerships, and the formal unveiling of its agentic roadmap at CES. Commerce media has emerged as one of Yahoo DSP’s more unexpected strengths. Buyers say its ability to blend retail data with ConnectID, extend into categories where Amazon is less dominant, and layer commerce signals across Yahoo-owned properties gives it a differentiated role — particularly as the category accelerates, as Digiday has outlined in its coverage of commerce media’s expansion beyond retail giants. Several senior agency executives say the platform has materially improved across UI, workflow, identity resolution, and support. Crucially, it has retained advanced trader controls at a time when rivals are abstracting them away — a dynamic Digiday has previously examined in relation to The Trade Desk and DV360 tightening control. Despite improved sentiment, challenges remain. Demand diversification has thinned following multiple rounds of layoffs, with the DSP team taking disproportionate hits, according to sources. Yahoo declined to comment. Yahoo DSP enters 2026 as a technically stronger, AI-forward, commerce-media-capable alternative at a moment when buyers are hungry for options. But the market is consolidating rapidly around Amazon, Google, and The Trade Desk. The question is whether improved tooling and agentic ambition are enough in a category increasingly defined by scale. Technology is seen by indies as a potential great equalizer when it comes to delivering solutions for clients, and competing with bigger agencies. Ad tech’s recent lexicon suggests “programmatic” will soon ceded way ground to “agentic.” The gap between Publicis, which ended up the year $9.5 billion in the positive, and second place Dentsu with $1.7 billion, is cavernous.

Title: Infosys risks losing $150 million a year from one of its largest clients

Infosys Ltd risks losing over a third of its $400 million annual revenue from Daimler, one of its three largest clients, as the German auto giant seeks a new vendor for software and equipment following execution delays, according to two people familiar with the details. India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services provider stands to lose the largest part of the contract under which it procured and provided iPhone cases, laptops, Microsoft 365 subscriptions, and fingerprint readers for the automakers’ back-end information technology (IT) operations, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified as the information is private. Bengaluru-based Infosys, which ended the previous fiscal ended March 2025 (FY25) with $19.28 billion in revenue, would now need to backfill $150 million, or 0.7% of its business, before eyeing incremental growth when macroeconomic uncertainty, tariff wars, and the rise of automation tools have squeezed client spending. “It is unlikely that Infosys will see meaningful incremental revenue from Daimler in the near term,” said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer (CEO) of HFS Research, a Massachusetts-based IT research and consulting firm. “Even where renewals occur, pricing pressure and scope rationalization typically offset any expansion. The focus is more on retaining relevance in strategic digital, engineering, and core platform areas rather than growing total contract value.” In December 2020, Infosys signed a $3.2 billion, eight-year IT transformation deal with Daimler. Under the terms, Infosys would provide services across six business divisions, including network services, cybersecurity, SAP software, data centres, after-sales call services, and workplace solutions or the IT procurement business–the biggest of the six arms. Daimler had split into Mercedes-Benz Group and Daimler Trucks in December 2021, but both units retained Infosys for IT services work. “Workplace solutions was supposed to be renewed last year but we are now waiting for June to get a clearer picture. We had floated an RFP (request for proposal) but that was not agreed upon by the client,” said the first of the two people quoted earlier. According to the second person, the partial renewal of the deal comes amid differences between the two companies over execution and billing delays. As of 12 January, Daimler, including Mercedes and Daimler Trucks, owes almost $47 million in dues to Infosys since 2021. Mint could not independently ascertain whether large deals have a provision to extend individual segments. However, the cybersecurity and data centre services have been renewed until 2029 under the Infosys-Daimler deal, while SAP, call functionality, and network segments have not been fully renewed yet, said the second person. Queries emailed to Infosys on Friday went unanswered, while Daimler and Mercedes-Benz declined to comment on “supplier relationships” and “internal processes”. One of India’s top IT services providers is eyeing a portion of Infosys’ contract with Daimler and has “already made a bid”, said the second person. Mint could not ascertain the name of the company. The Daimler contract was one of the dozen mega deals worth over $1 billion that the company has won since Salil Parekh took over as chief executive officer in January 2018, steering the company to outperform its peers in the number of mega deals secured. According to an executive, Daimler is one of Infosys’s three largest clients, after Apple Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Other large contracts Infosys won include the July 2020 10-year deal worth $1.89 billion with Vanguard and a $1.6-billion contract with the UK’s public health provider, the National Health Service, signed in October last year. The Daimler project is dubbed the ‘twice as fast program’ for Infosys. It helped double Infosys’s revenue from manufacturers to $3 billion last fiscal from $1.3 billion in FY20. During this five-year period, Infosys’s overall revenue grew 42% to $19.28 billion in FY25. The company, which announces its third-quarter results on 14 January, expects to end FY26 with revenue growth of 2-3% in constant-currency terms, a measure that excludes the impact of currency fluctuations. Revenue from Infosys Automotive and Mobility GmbH, a subsidiary that the IT giant created for the Daimler project, declined for the first time in FY25. It fell 8.5% over the previous fiscal to $418 million, after growing more than 40% for two straight years, according to JM Financial analysts. The unit has also been unprofitable for four straight years. “If there is a revenue decline in the subsidiary, it clearly means that revenue from the Daimler account has reached its peak and matured,” wrote JM Financial’s Abhishek Kumar and Nandan Arekal in a note dated 16 June 2025. Mint had reported on 24 February last year that Infosys was eyeing an early renewal with Daimler with a new AI arm. It now risks losing incremental business if the workplace arm of the deal is not renewed. Still, ending part of previously signed contracts with IT services providers is not new. Several companies have opened their own back-end tech centres, terminating contracts with existing IT vendors mid-way through the deal. Transamerica nixed a 10-year IT outsourcing deal worth $2 billion with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd in June 2023, five years after signing the contract. Similarly, later that year, third-largest HCL Technologies and State Street called off their decade-long partnership after the client in-sourcing its tech needs.

Title: Motional puts AI at center of robotaxi reboot as it targets 2026 for driverless service | TechCrunch

The company, born from a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, had already missed a deadline to launch a driverless robotaxi service with partner Lyft. It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another $1 billion investment to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a 40% restructuring cut in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology. Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It paused everything and picked option No. 1. Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said. “We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.” This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said. Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT. Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds. “This is really critical for two things; one is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost-optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.” TechCrunch got a firsthand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress. Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way. Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies. There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double-parked Amazon delivery van. Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost-effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said. “I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.” Topics Transportation Editor Plan ahead for the 2026 StrictlyVC events.

X said the tool is designed to reduce ambiguity around tickers and smart contracts, particularly in crypto markets where symbols can overlap. In some cases, assets will be identified by their underlying smart contract addresses. Bier said X plans to collect user feedback ahead of a public release targeted for next month. The company did not disclose whether the feature would include trading or monetisation components. The move reflects X’s broader effort to position the platform as a real-time source of financial information, as users increasingly discuss markets and trading activity on the platform. Musk has repeatedly said he wants to turn X into an “everything app,” including payments and financial services, and has previously floated the idea of supporting cryptocurrencies on the platform, while stopping short of confirming whether digital assets such as Dogecoin, his preferred meme coin, would be integrated into any future payments product. X’s former CEO, Linda Yaccarino, also announced in June that the platform would support in-app investing and trading. A month later, she resigned. Further announcements regarding an exact timeline of that feature’s rollout have not been provided. X Corp did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment. Bier joined X around the same time as Yaccarino’s departure, and is an advisor to Solana and a venture partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. He previously held roles at xAI and Meta within a division that built experimental, consumer-facing apps.

Title: The gap between Gemini and ChatGPT is narrowing

Every time Lakshmi publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Gemini is on a roll. After a slow start, Google's AI chatbot is rapidly gaining users, topping AI benchmark leaderboards, and forcing its biggest competitor, OpenAI's ChatGPT, into "code red" emergencies. Now, in another big leap, Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is partnering with Gemini on a new shopping experience — similar to one it struck with ChatGPT in October. When people use Gemini to ask questions or search, the assistant will now automatically recommend relevant products from Walmart and Sam's Club, drawing on users' past online and in-store purchases, Walmart said in a press release on Sunday. For users who have linked their Walmart accounts, Gemini can tailor recommendations based on purchase history and enable delivery of in-store items within three hours, or as little as 30 minutes. Walmart CEO John Furner said the partnership marks a shift in how people shop. "The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail. We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it," Furner said in the press release. In recent years, discovery-led shopping experiences on social media platforms like TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, and live shopping services like Whatnot have disrupted the traditional digital shopping experience. AI is reshaping the discovery process even further. While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall number of users by a significant margin, it's closing the gap and even outperforming OpenAI in other key ways. In November, after years of taking heat as the slow-moving leviathan in the AI race, Google redeemed itself with the launch of Gemini 3. The latest version of Google's chatbot was well received by both consumers and industry leaders. Its stock price surged in the weeks following the rollout, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he would switch from ChatGPT to Gemini, calling the latter "insane" in a viral post. The hype forced OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare a "code red" at his company. Gemini also benefits from Google's larger ecosystem of products, like Search, Workplace, Android, and Google TV. Another promising development for Gemini, underpinning its partnership with Walmart, is the launch of a new retail protocol, which Google refers to as the Universal Commerce Protocol. "AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future," Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a post on X on Sunday. "To help lay the groundwork, we partnered with Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target and Walmart to create the Universal Commerce Protocol, a new open standard for agents and systems to talk to each other across every step of the shopping journey." Protocols have long served as the invisible scaffolding of the digital realm, and streamlining a new era of agent-to-agent communication is a critical step in unlocking an agent-powered world, founders building AI protocols previously told Business Insider. OpenAI unveiled its own commerce protocol in September, following the launch of Instant Checkout. The new feature lets users buy items directly in ChatGPT from Etsy and over a million Shopify merchants, the company said in a blog post announcing the feature. OpenAI also said the protocol behind it, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, is "an open standard for AI commerce that lets AI agents, people, and businesses work together to complete purchases." It was developed alongside Stripe. Google's mission appears to be similar. In response to a request for comment, a Google spokesperson referred Business Insider to a blog post Pichai wrote about its new Unified Commerce Protocol. In it, he explains how the new protocol will change the consumer shopping experience. He said if a shopper is looking for a suitcase, the protocol allows retailers to instantly offer a new-member price or prompt loyalty enrollment. Returning customers might see tailored discounts or product suggestions, such as packing cubes, when they check out. The transaction can then be completed in just a few taps through Google Pay — without leaving the chat, Pichai said. Jump to

Title: Magnificent 7’s stock market dominance shows signs of cracking
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/11/magnificent-7-stock-market-dominance-cracking-nvidia-microsoft-apple-meta-alphabet-amazon-tesla/
Time Published: 2026-01-11T21:43:27Z
Full Content:
To beat the market in recent years, many investors applied a simple strategy: Load up on the biggest US technology stocks. It paid handsomely for a long time. But last year, it didn’t. For the first time since 2022, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, the majority of the Magnificent 7 tech giants performed worse than the S&P 500 Index. While the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index rose 25% in 2025, compared with 16% for the S&P 500, that was only because of the enormous gains by Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Many Wall Street pros see that dynamic continuing in 2026, as profit growth slows and questions about payoffs from heavy artificial intelligence spending rise. So far they’ve been right, with the Magnificent 7 index up just 0.5% and the S&P 500 climbing 1.8% to start the year. Suddenly stock picking within the group is crucial. “This isn’t a one-size-fits-all market,” said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, which has $1.4 trillion in assets. “If you’re just buying the group, the losers could offset the winners.” The three-year bull market has been led by the tech giants, with Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. alone accounting for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gains since the run began in October 2022. But enthusiasm for them is cooling as interest in the rest of the S&P 500 rises. With Big Tech’s earnings growth slowing, investors are no longer content with promises of AI riches — they want to start seeing a return. Profits for the Magnificent 7 are expected to climb about 18% in 2026, the slowest pace since 2022 and not much better than the 13% rise projected for the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. “We’re already seeing a broadening of earnings growth and we think that’s going to continue,” said David Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tech is not the only game in town.” One source of optimism is the group’s relatively subdued valuations. The Magnificent 7 index is priced at 29 times profits projected over the next 12 months, well below the 40s multiples earlier in the decade. The S&P 500 is trading at 22 times expected earnings, and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at 25 times. Here’s a look at expectations for the year ahead. The dominant AI chipmaker is under pressure from rising competition and concerns about the sustainability of spending by its biggest customers. The stock is up 1,165% since the end of 2022, but it has lost 11% since its Oct. 29 record. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has won data center orders from OpenAI and Oracle Corp., and Nvidia customers like Alphabet are increasingly deploying their own custom made processors. Still, its sales continue to race ahead as demand for chips outstrips supply. Wall Street is bullish, with 76 of the 82 analysts covering the chipmaker holding buy ratings. The average analyst price target implies a roughly 39% gain over the next 12 months, best among the group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For Microsoft, 2025 was the second consecutive year it underperformed the S&P 500. One of the biggest AI spenders, it’s expected to invest nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures during its current fiscal year, which ends in June. That figure is projected to rise to $116 billion the following year, according to the average of analyst estimates. The data center buildout is fueling a resurgence in revenue growth in Microsoft’s cloud-computing business, but the company hasn’t had as much success in getting customers to pay for the AI services infused into its software products. Investors want to start seeing returns on those investments, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “What you’re seeing is some people looking for a little bit more quality management in terms of that cash flow management and a better idea on what profitability really looks like when it comes to AI,” Mulberry said. Apple has been far less aggressive with its AI ambitions than the rest of the Magnificent 7. The stock was punished for it last year, falling almost 20% through the start of August. But then it caught on as an “anti-AI” play, soaring 34% through the end of the year as investors rewarded its lack of AI spending risk. At the same time, strong iPhone sales reassured investors that the company’s most important product remains in high demand. Accelerating growth will be the key for Apple shares this year. Its momentum has slowed recently, the stock closed higher on Friday, narrowly avoiding matching its longest losing streak since 1991. However, revenue is expected to expand 9% in fiscal 2026, which ends in September, the fastest pace since 2021. With the stock valued at 31 times estimated earnings, the second highest in the Magnificent 7 after Tesla, it will need the push to keep the rally going. A year ago, OpenAI was seen as leading the AI race and investors feared Alphabet would get left behind. Today, Google’s parent is a consensus favorite, with dominant positions across the AI landscape. Alphabet’s latest Gemini AI model received rave reviews, easing concerns about OpenAI. And its tensor processing unit chips are considered a potential significant driver of future revenue growth, which could eat into Nvidia’s commanding share of the AI semiconductor market. The stock rose more than 65% last year, the best performance in the Magnificent 7. But how much more can it run? The company is approaching $4 trillion in market value, and the shares trade at around 28 times estimated earnings, well above their five-year average of 20. The average analyst price target projects just a 3.9% gain this year. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant was the weakest Magnificent 7 stock in 2025, its seventh straight year in that position. But Amazon has charged out of the gate in early 2026 and is leading the pack. Much of the optimism surrounding the company is based on Amazon Web Services, which posted its fastest growth in years in the company’s most recent results. Concerns that AWS was falling behind its rivals has pressured the stock, as has the company’s aggressive AI spending, which includes efforts to improve efficiency at its warehouses, in part by using robotics. Investors expect the efficiency push to start paying off before long, which could make this the year the stock goes from laggard to leader. “Automation in warehouses and more efficient shipping will be huge,” said Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial, which owns Amazon shares. “It hasn’t gotten the love yet, but it reminds me of Alphabet last year, which was sort of left behind amid all the concerns about competition from OpenAI, then really took off.” Perhaps no stock in the group shows how investors have turned skeptical about lavish AI spending more than Meta. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has pushed expensive acquisitions and talent hires in pursuit of his AI ambitions, including a $14 billion investment in Scale AI in which Meta also hired the startup’s CEO Alexandr Wang to be its chief AI officer. That strategy was fine with shareholders — until it wasn’t. The stock tumbled in late October after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $72 billion and projected “notably larger”spending in 2026. When the shares hit a record in August they were up 35% for the year, but they’ve since dropped 17%. Demonstrating how that spending is boosting profits will be critical for Meta in 2026. Tesla’s shares were the worst performers in the Magnificent 7 through the first half of 2025, but then soared more than 40% in the second half as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk shifted focus from slumping electric vehicle sales to self-driving cars and robotics. The rally has Tesla’s valuation at almost 200 times estimated profits, making it the second most expensive stock in the S&P 500 behind takeover target Warner Bros. Discover Inc. After two years of stagnant revenue, Tesla is expected to start growing again in 2026. Revenue is projected to rise 12% this year and 18% next year, following an estimated 3% contraction in 2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, Wall Street is pessimistic about Tesla shares this year. The average analyst price target projects a 9.1% decline over the next 12 months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Title: GameStop set to close over 410 US stores in early 2026 as CEO’s $35 billion stock award causes massive outrage

GameStop is reportedly shuttering hundreds of stores in the United States, with recent estimates predicting that around 295 to 410 locations will close in the first quarter of 2026. This does not include the 590 stores that closed down last year. Meanwhile, as reported by Reuters, GameStop's CEO has been awarded performance-based stock options estimated to be worth around $35 billion, provided the company meets a performance milestone of over $100 billion in market capitalization and around $10 billion in net EBITDA. Cohen became GameStop’s CEO in September 2023 and is the company’s largest shareholder. He doesn’t receive a salary or a guaranteed bonus. Instead, he aims to be compensated through performance milestones. Notices about the latest round of closures appeared on social media and were subsequently compiled into lists on sites such as the “GameStop Closing List” and the official GameStop Subreddit (now removed by moderators). These reports detail confirmed shuttered locations and potential rumors of store closures across states such as New York and Connecticut. Recent reports state that select GameStop sites at Enfield Square Mall in Connecticut and Lenox Square Mall in Georgia closed in early January. Former employees are, of course, frustrated with the layoffs, as these job cuts follow GameStop’s February 2025 SEC filing, which detailed: We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review, which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While the review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025. For context, GameStop’s fiscal year 2025 ends on January 31, 2026, meaning more unfortunate closures are on the horizon for what was once considered the go-to store for video games a few years ago. GameStop is also scaling down internationally. The company has sold its Italian operations and shuttered locations in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. In addition, the company plans to divest its Canadian branch. Currently, rumors are circulating that GameStop is considering closing stores in New Zealand, where 38 stores operate.

Title: As sure as Night ’n Day: Family-run business that rose from a corner dairy to 54 franchise stores – can it disrupt supermarket duopoly?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Night ’n Day general manager Matt Lane and one of the company's newest franchise stores - in Kawarau, near Queenstown. Composite photo / Oliver Rusden They hit headlines recently by selling 20,000 blocks of cut-price butter. Shayne Currie charts the rise of Night ’n Day, a family-owned business with a franchise network of more than 50 stores. Does New Zealand’s third-biggest grocery retailer hold a key to breaking the supermarket duopoly? We’re bringing back a selection of our best-read Premium stories for your summer reading. This story was first published in September. Bridget Stevens started working in the shop as a teenager, serving at the counter every second weekend. At 15, she left school for a fulltime job in the store. By the time she was 34, she owned it. Now, another 17 years later, Stevens – along with her sister, Rebecca Excell – runs one of the most renowned Night ’n Day stores in the country. In Winton, Southland, the pair have 25 staff and a steady stream of customers: the locals who they know on a first-name basis, the truckies lining up at 6am for coffee and hot food and the State Highway 6 travellers popping in for a road-trip snack before heading north to Queenstown or south to Invercargill. “It was just a little corner dairy when I started,” Stevens says. “Olly Olsson was the owner, Mum worked here as well. When I turned 15, Mum left and they offered me her fulltime job – I left school and came here.” Then, 17-and-a-half years ago, Olsson sold up. He’d been at Night ’n Day’s annual conference and returned home to Winton, informing Stevens that he was offering her the business first. “I couldn’t stop crying. He was like, ‘Right, go and talk to your parents about it’. I went and got advice from Mum and Dad, and they were like, ‘That’s a no-brainer’.” In 2017, Excell bought into the business – she is now a 40% shareholder in the franchise. Together, the pair make a formidable team – the store has now won five store-of-the-year awards, including their most recent just last week. They say they complement each other well – Stevens with her knowledge and history; Excell, who trained at one point to be a teacher but never made it to the classroom, with her administrative skills. They both have a natural rapport with their staff. “Before Dad passed away, he was the referee,” Excell laughs, when asked if there have ever been any sisterly squabbles. “He used to come in and sort us out.” Mum still keeps an eye on the shop as well. “She’s very proud,” Stevens says. Family connections and community links run deep at Night ’n Day. Among many examples, there’s father-and-son combination Alan and Hamish Garrick, who own four Night ’n Day stores in Queenstown and Arrowtown, and husband-and-wife Sukhwinder Singh and Manjit Kaur, who own the Mt Maunganui and Rotorua stores. At the top of the business is general manager Matt Lane, who was born in 1990, the same year that his parents, Andrew and Denise – the original Night ’n Day founders – turned their fledgling group of stores into a franchise chain. The Lane family has owned Night ’n Day’s original Regent Rd store in Dunedin since 1984, buying an ageing grocer’s shop with a decaying floor and transforming it, eventually, into a 24-hour student mecca, selling all manner of hangover-curtailing staples (a hot steak pie and Coca Cola, anyone?). The Regent Rd store remains world-famous in Dunedin, but 35 years on from its launch as a franchise business, Night ’n Day has expanded well beyond its Otago roots, now operating 54 stores across New Zealand. It is the country’s third-biggest retail grocery chain. At the same time, the company is pushing for a more level playing field to take on the supermarket duopoly of Foodstuffs – which runs New World, Pak’nSave and Four Square – and Woolworths NZ (previously Progressive), the owner of Woolworths and Fresh Choice/Super Value. Last month, Night ’n Day rolled back the price of butter to August 2024 prices. Rather than a 500g block of yellow gold selling for around $11, Night ‘n Day sold 20,000 blocks – they were limited to one per customer – for $6.50 each. An effective marketing campaign and publicity stunt, it certainly forced home a point about the hefty price of butter, with the duopoly in the spotlight, and broader consumer speculation of a major new competitor. “I think too much focus is on a third player,” Matt Lane told Karen O’Leary of the Paddy Gower Has Issues TV show. “How can we change the market to be a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth? Let’s not limit ourselves. Are the small centres going to end up with Costco’s? Absolutely not. “Is Timaru, is Greymouth? They’re not going to end up with a Costco, so why should [those towns] be disadvantaged purely because we’re trying to get an international player that competes in the major cities to try and compress prices?” Lane tells the Herald that the duopoly situation has been a long-term problem since the early 2000s and, therefore, needs long-term solutions. He’s a big fan of the Government effectively carpet-bombing the problem with solutions, rather than a piecemeal approach. “I feel – and it’s easy for me to say this – that there needs to be an overcorrection and then wind it back if necessary, rather than just trying to take one step, then one step, and then one step, and saying, ‘Is it actually working?’” The Government, the Commerce Commission and “the whole of New Zealand know it’s an issue”, Lane says. “We seem to be content just to say, ‘We’ll try and tweak wholesale, or create a wholesale supplier. We’ll try and tweak some of the competition rules or the land covenants’. “Let’s try to fix everything. If we find that something is a bit harsh, you can still dial it back again to find that parity, but we’re a long way away from creating competition.” Night ’n Day was once a member of the Foodstuffs co-operative, giving it access to wholesale prices of dry grocery items. That came to a halt in 2011 - Foodstuffs has previously cited breaches of its membership agreement; the decision also coincided with Night ’n Day partnering up with Gull to open 21 new stores in the North Island. The grocery challenges have meant some Night ’n Day stores lost the ability to hold liquor licences. Because grocery wholesale prices jumped and therefore the retail price lifted, they weren’t selling enough relevant products to be deemed a grocery retailer (and therefore able to also sell booze). Despite these hurdles, Night ‘n Day is a big business success story, largely because of its agility and a necessary pivot away from a focus on groceries – they’re still there, but currently more expensive because of the wholesale issues – to a more purposeful, competitive offering within three distinct pillars: coffee, milk bar and fresh food-to-go/deli foods. “That’s because everyone can access different prices and you can create a differentiation of the product,” Lane says. “That’s where we see a massive amount of growth and that allowed us to sustain our operations because we lost all the profitability and sales of grocery.” While serving barista coffee and hot food might seem common sense, New Zealand has a reputation for leading these retail trends internationally. Lane recalls being at a US retail conference when an expert speaker’s suggestion of barista coffee – rather than the instant, filter variety – was met with gasps and concern in the American audience. New Zealand had been selling it for years. Night ’n Day has also been turbocharged in recent years with delivery service in the form of Uber Eats, Door Dash and Deliver Easy. “It’s the next step of convenience,” Lane says. “Historically, we’re a convenience store because you can get in and out very quickly based on the format size.” Now, convenience arrives at your front door. “People are living a lot more here and now. They’re living for the moment. They value their time a lot more.” While Night ’n Day has a network of 54 stores dotted from Southland to Whangārei and is always looking to grow, Lane says there is no magical number. “It’s the quality over quantity for us. We look at every opportunity as it comes across. We certainly don’t sit there ... being complacent with what we’ve got. “We do want to grow, but we want to make sure that it works, first of all, for the brand, franchisees and the site itself.” Lane reveals the company is looking at several potential new sites, including one at Jack’s Point, in Queenstown, as well as exploring some further options in Dunedin. There is also a “clear gap” in Hamilton. “It just feels like that’s a logical city we’re not part of, when you look at our geographical spread.” An indication of a franchise value is revealed on Night ’n Day’s own website. Right now, two franchises are listed for sale - Cromwell, for $680,000 plus stock at valuation (an estimated $160,000), and Dee St in Invercargill, for $450,000 plus stock at valuation (estimated at $125,000). According to the website, the Cromwell store has a weekly turnover of $62,700 and Dee St has a weekly turnover of $51,000. The average gross profit for each site is 34%. Lane talks of Night ’n Day having more agility than similar-sized retail convenience brands. “We can’t compete on [a marketing] budget with the BPs and the Zs in terms of doing things that way. We’ve just got to do it by creating a point of difference and we do that through our supplier base, speed to market, the ability to have an idea in the morning and execute it in the afternoon.” Like Bridget Stevens in Winton, Matt Lane first experienced life in the shop as a young teenager, stacking shelves. That later became a university job behind the counter, alongside a number of his mates. After graduating from Otago University and working for four years at Deloitte, he came back into the business in 2016, working in business development and then finance before becoming general manager in 2019. Lane’s mother, Denise Lane, says she and her husband, Andrew, owned two standalone dairies in Dunedin initially. They sold those in 1984 to buy the Regent Rd store in the heart of the student district. It was a good-performing store and long-established on a busy street. The site also became the family home for the Lanes and their young children, with their residence attached. Staff had to use the family toilet. “Our hallway wasn’t a normal hallway – it was all filled with shelves and stock because our house was also our storage room.” Opposite them was a BP station, and the Lanes started hearing whispers that it would start trading 24 hours a day. They acted quickly and got in first. They knew they needed to retain their regular customers – a 24-hour rival threatened to draw them away. While Night ’n Day went 24 hours, the BP never did. It’s no longer there. “It was the first standalone 24-hour convenience store in New Zealand,” Andrew Lane says. “There was nothing like it. It started off slow, but it actually picked up and we thought, ‘we’re on a winner here’.” Confident that the model could work elsewhere, the couple then sought out and bought the best dairies in Invercargill and Christchurch. In 1990, the couple were at a National Association of Retail Grocers of New Zealand (Nargon) conference where they met representatives from the Night Owl convenience chain from Australia. “At that stage, we had five stores and they had 10 or 11, and they explained to us about franchising, which we’d never heard of as a business system back then. We’d probably heard of the McDonald’s way of doing things, but didn’t really know too much about it,” Andrew Lane says. “They explained what they had gone through – they said you should really look at it, it’ll move you away from the day-to-day hassles of operating a convenience store, and you’ll be able to help other people replicate what you’ve done. “We did some investigation into franchising and we thought, well, yeah, this system works and it works well. And we said, if we’re going to do that, then we’ve got to come up with a brand.” With the help and expertise of a Dunedin graphics designer, they came up with the Night ’n Day concept and worked over the following months to develop systems, including operations manuals. The other dairies were rebranded. Andrew Lane was worried about that, but he says there was no pushback. “There was none at all; it was all in our head!” Denise Lane puts a myth to bed that the blue-and-gold colours were a nod to their Otago heritage. Not at all, she says – they represent night and day. Matt Lane says there is no one “silver bullet” to compete against the supermarkets. “We need the foundations to be able to compete, whether it’s ourselves, whether it’s The Warehouse, whether it’s a new player coming in. More competition in this space helps us, even if we’re not the leader in it. “Do we want to grow? Yes, absolutely. The only way I can see it happening, though, is through the existing set-ups. “It’s very hard for any player to sit there and go, I’m going to open opposite a Pak’nSave and compete. It’s just not going to happen. There’s not the brand presence. There’s not the pockets to be able to do so. “We’ve grown organically over time. We’ve utilised the conversion of some Four Square stores to be able to do that. “To start creating competition, I think one of the most important things is removing the restraints of trade on the duopoly stores. If someone is currently operating a Four Square and they want to convert or go independent, there should be no barriers for them to do so.” Lane points out there’s not a lack of brands in New Zealand, it’s a commonality of ownership. “If you had Pak’nSave, Fresh Choice, New World, Woolworths and Four Square all competing against each other, it would actually be quite a competitive marketplace and they’d all try and take each other’s market share. “Whereas what we’ve got is quite a complacent duopoly where everyone just plays in their own space ... ” Lane also points out that for every day that the status quo remains, the duopoly grows stronger. “They’re opening new stores, they’re creating a better footprint, they’re cementing brand awareness. “Competitors are getting more and more nervous. It’s one thing to come out and go, we’re going to fix the supermarket industry – that happened in 2021. We’re now in 2025. “My discussion to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] was there’s been nothing given to me that has improved my business and my ability to compete that wasn’t available to me in 2021. So we’re four years deep and I don’t have one tangible thing I can point to say, ‘This is helping me grow and succeed’. “But then you go, ‘Who is going to take the risk and why would they take the risk in the New Zealand market?’ Bit different in the States or Australia, given the population size and density. “But there needs to be a genuine motivation or genuine support to actually be able to encourage people to do that.” After first interviewing Lane in early August, I went back to him this week for an update. “No public announcement has benefited us to increasing competition, however what is encouraging is the key components that will improve competition are still being worked though and considered. “It is a wait-and-see, but there is still a lot of resource being allocated to increasing competition and I’m hopeful something will eventuate.” For all their success, Andrew and Denise Lane remain remarkably grounded – they are thrilled to see new generations of families in their franchise stores coming through the business. “I don’t know if I see it as a major success story,” Andrew Lane says. “I probably see it more as something that we just wanted to achieve and just kept on achieving it to grow.” He says when the business entered its franchising structure in 1990, it was with the intention of mentoring and “helping other people enjoy a business that we both thoroughly enjoyed, and to grow like that”. Denise Lane adds: “It was a case of long, hard hours. I guess we never thought it was going to get to where we are now. “It was like a Ferris wheel – when you got on the ride, you couldn’t get off it until it stopped. It has not stopped yet.” Disclaimer: Night ’n Day recently sponsored the NZ Herald’s Great NZ Road Trip project. This article is an independent editorial story.

Title: The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a good choice if you want to buy a pair of earbuds almost exclusively for FPS games

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a specialist product that excels in its particular niche. With clear, directional sound, they’re perfect for competitive shooters like Counter-Strike 2 and might even give you a slight advantage over your competition, but the very flat bass and lack of in-built microphone make them a poor fit for more general gaming in other genres. Comfortable with a wide range of fit options Clear, high fidelity spatial sound Fantastic included case Perfect for FPS games Lacks microphone Flat overall tuning Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Sony makes it very clear who the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are for. Developed in partnership with eSports team Fnatic, these wired in-ear monitor (IEM) style earbuds are squarely aimed at competitive first-person shooter (FPS) players or those with a generous budget aspiring to become one. Retailing for $149.99 / £129 / AU$209, they’re competing closely with some of the best gaming earbuds like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but don’t deliver the same all-round performance. If you’re looking for something that will elevate your experience in some of the best story games like God of War Ragnarok or Cyberpunk 2077, then these are certainly not it. The Sony Inzone E9 headphones are highly comfortable to wear and come with a superb carrying case, but the unapologetically flat sound is not going to help cutscenes or action sequences sound their best. The GameBuds, or even Sony’s own but more expensive Inzone Buds, are clearly better choices, but it's hard to fault the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones for that, as that’s obviously not what they’re for. They really come into their own in a competitive first-person shooter (FPS) setting, pairing well with games like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Here, the lack of bass prevents explosion and gunfire sound effects from overwhelming your senses, allowing you to focus on the impressive directional reproduction instead. The direction of key audio cues like footsteps is crystal clear and remarkably easy to discern, potentially giving you an advantage over those without such specialised audio gear. The noise isolation is exquisite, thanks in no small part to the excellent seal of the headphones in your ears. A plethora of ear tips is included in the box to make it easy to find the perfect fit, and the included USB-C audio box stores EQ profile settings to make for a hassle-free setup every time - ideal if you’re competing in tournaments and need to access the same settings on a new machine. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are priced at $149.99 / £129 / AU$209. This is a significant investment for a pair of wired gaming earbuds, with top wireless options like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds costing not much more at $159.99 / £159.99 / AU$359. In addition to traditional gaming options, the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are also competing with the pricey in-ear monitor (IEM) earbuds favored by some FPS players. Here they come in at a very similar price to relatively affordable models from other big brands, such as the $149.99 / £129.99 Sennheiser IE 200. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are made specifically for gaming, however, setting them apart from most of the market and helping to justify the price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are available directly via Sony in the US and UK. They can also be found at a wide range of retailers, such as Best Buy in the US or Amazon in the UK. In Australia they’re in stock at both JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman. Price $149.99 / £129 / AU$209 Weight 0.16oz / 4.7g Compatibility PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, mobile Connection type Wired (3.5mm / USB-C with audio box) Battery life N/A Features USB-C audio box, spatial audio Software Inzone Hub (PC) The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones will have a familiar design if you’ve used a pair of IEM earbuds before. They’re lightweight, with rounded earbuds connected to a rigid section of cable that hooks around the top of your ears. Two colorways are available: black and white. Both are rather plain, but the abundance of Inzone logo branding printed on the earbuds does give them some character. Sony has definitely made some smart decisions when it comes to practicality, particularly with the length of the headphone’s cable. At 5.9ft / 1.8m, I found that it was more than long enough to comfortably reach my ears directly from my gaming PC’s 3.5mm headphone jack without the need for a cable extender. If you play on a console, you won’t have any issues hooking it up to your controller. I also appreciate the clear left / right marking that’s printed on each earbud, with the latter presented in a bright red that makes it easy to spot at a glance. A wealth of alternate ear tips come in the box, with a total of eight pairs to choose from. This includes standard silicone rubber ear tips and more foamy noise isolation earbud tips, both in four sizes (ranging from extra small to extra large). These are Sony’s widespread EP-EX10A and EP-NI1010 series tips - so replacements are easy to find if you need them later down the line. You get a USB-C audio box for use with PCs, too. This can be used to store settings from the compatible Inzone Hub software, like your desired equalizer pre-sets or custom profiles. It also lets you use a dedicated spatial sound mode, giving a good impression of sound in a 3D space, albeit at the cost of some overall fidelity. Between uses, you can store everything in the included carrying case that benefits from a surprisingly unique design. It’s divided into two compartments (one for the earbuds and the other for the audio box) joined together by a springy rubberized strip. The underside of the strip has little magnetic buttons, clipping down to keep everything in place. It might be a bit hard to imagine, but it works really well and is much more practical than the cheap pouches included with most earbuds these days. You also get a little Inzone-branded cable tidy, which is a neat bonus. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones have quite a flat sound profile out of the box, though this is presumably intentional. There’s not a lot of bass leading to quite an unexciting sound. Playing through some Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Assassin’s Creed Shadows on PS5, key story moments felt a tad muted with the backing music missing the punch needed to really drive the emotion home. You can address this somewhat by tweaking the EQ settings in the compatible Inzone Hub software, but there’s only so much that you can do to increase the bass on hardware that’s not designed for it. For story-focused games, the results were never punchier than what you get out of the box with the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds and far less effective than even cheap wired over-ear sets like the Corsair HS50. This lack of bass makes a lot more sense when you jump into a competitive shooter like Counter-Strike 2. Flashbangs and grenades are no longer overwhelming and don’t threaten to deafen you if you’re playing at higher volumes. Gunfire is more subdued, helping you stay focused in firefights. The sound is crystal clear too, with an impressive level of directionality that makes it easy to track enemy movements using key sounds like footsteps. It’s very impressive, especially given how well the effect holds up in more frantic situations. Diving into an explosive match of Nuketown in Black Ops 7, I was able to accurately hear where nearby opponents were moving, even against the constant barrage of explosions conjured by grenades and killstreaks. The detail is excellent, which is borderline essential in tense extraction shooters such as Escape From Tarkov, where being able to discern the subtle snapping of a twig can often mean the difference between life and death. If you’re currently one of the many people devoting every waking moment to Arc Raiders, I could see the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones being worth the asking price on this fact alone. Despite offering no active noise cancellation (ANC), the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones do a commendable job of blocking out background noise by virtue of the strong seal of their fit. No, it’s not as effective as the ANC of the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but it is good enough to drown out household sounds and conversations with the volume set at a decent level. Although very uncommon in the IEM market, I’m also a little disappointed that the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones don’t come with a small built-in microphone. It’s not a dealbreaker by any means, but it did mean that I had to reach for my Final VR2000 gaming earbuds when I wanted to chat with a friend while playing an Xbox Series X game. You’re a die-hard FPS fanIf you’re an FPS-head shopping for a pair of earbuds that you want to use exclusively to play the latest shooters, then the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones could be a very worthwhile investment. You want every possible advantageThe directionality offered by the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones is excellent and could mean the difference between a win and a loss in a competitive gaming setting. Pick up a pair if you want to ensure you have every possible advantage. You want a general use pairThe flat sound profile of the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones means that they’re not ideal for general use. At this price, there are loads of strong alternatives if you want something designed for a wider selection of genres with a microphone to help you chat with friends.

Title: Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, and Sergey Brin are close to joining the $300 billion club as tech fortunes soar

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The $200 billion club could soon be old hat as tech bosses ride the AI wave to new levels of wealth. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have seen their personal fortunes soar to over $250 billion each, putting all three men within striking distance of the $300 billion mark. For context, some of America's largest companies, including Costco, Netflix, Home Depot, Chevron, and Wells Fargo, have market capitalizations between $300 billion and $400 billion. Page and Brin were worth $281 billion and $261 billion, respectively, at Friday's close, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. They added $101 billion and $92 billion to each of their fortunes in 2025, making them the year's biggest wealth gainers after Elon Musk, and have gained another $12 billion and $11 billion each already this year. The key driver has been Alphabet shares soaring 65% last year, and rising a further 4.5% so far in 2026, as investors have grown more and more excited about the search-and-advertising titan's AI efforts. Bezos' wealth has climbed more modestly, from $239 billion at the start of 2025 to $268 billion at Friday's close. That reflects a roughly 5% rise in Amazon's stock price last year, and another 6% rise this year, as investors wager the e-commerce giant's massive AI investments will start to pay off. Only Musk is richer than the trio; the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was worth $639 billion at Friday's close. He saw a $165 billion wealth jump last year, thanks to Tesla stock gaining 11% and SpaceX's valuation leaping from $350 billion to $800 billion. He's added an unmatched $19 billion to his name so far in 2026. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Musk in wealth last September, when his fortune ballooned by a record $89 billion in a single day to $388 billion. Since then, investors have cooled on Oracle's AI prospects, pushing down Ellison's net worth to $251 billion at Friday's close. In total, there are 18 "centibillionaires," or individuals with at least a $100 billion net worth. As a group, they grew $708 billion richer last year, lifting their combined wealth to $3.6 trillion — a figure greater than Microsoft's market value. Within that elite group, there are seven people worth upward of $200 billion: Musk, Page, Bezos, Brin, Ellison, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury giant LVMH. All of them except Arnault own huge stakes in some of the world's leading AI companies, which have soared in value as investors rush to buy their shares on news of buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Advocates, including investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary, have told Business Insider that AI will supercharge productivity and boost corporate profits. But skeptics, like Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, have warned that tech giants are overinvesting in microchips, data centers, and other infrastructure in their scramble to win the AI race, creating a bubble that will burst disastrously down the line.

Costco is widely known for offering a wide selection of items at relatively low prices, but the club's $65 annual membership fee can deter some shoppers. Of course, the savings from occasional discounts on big-ticket items such as TVs, mattresses, and household appliances can easily exceed the cost of a year's membership, but those purchases are expensive and infrequent for most households. That leaves a lot of folks asking, as one curious customer on Reddit did, if Costco's discounts on the basics are enough to make a membership worth it. Doubters have good reason to be skeptical: retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target offer pretty competitive pricing on a lot of products, not to mention local grocery stores. And then there's pack sizes — a multi-year supply of aluminum foil might technically be a savings, but it probably isn't all that useful. Nor does it save money to get more of something perishable, like fresh fruit, only to throw a lot of it away. So, which product categories would actually make a Costco membership worth it? The question is increasingly important for US households who are focused on stretching their dollars, a consumer climate that has favored value-conscious retailers like Costco and Walmart. To find out, we rounded up several of the most popular responses from users in the Costco subreddit, along with a few additional ones based on our experience. We focused the list on more shelf-stable items that are typically consumed steadily throughout the year and visited a local warehouse to check prices. We then compared those prices to comparable offerings at traditional retailers, such as Walmart, Amazon, Target, and others. We also asked ChatGPT to estimate how much of each item a typical two-person household would likely use in a year and compared annual costs before discounts based on those quantities. With a few exceptions, we used prices from national brands that are widely available in many retailers for an apples-to-apples comparison. Price gaps can be even more competitive with store brand alternatives. While everything on the list was cheaper at Costco in-store, we calculated a payback score for each item to represent how much of the $65 membership fee is accounted for in relative savings after one year of shopping exclusively for that one item at Costco versus a conventional retailer. For example, a payback score of 100 means the savings and the fee are equal; a score of 200 means the savings were twice the fee, and a score of 50 means that half the fee was offset by that single product. Again, this analysis assumes no other purchases at Costco, which in our experience is extremely unlikely. Here's what we found, ranked from lowest to highest. A 38-pound bag of Blue Buffalo dog food sells for $65 at Costco, while the equivalent weight at a typical retailer would cost $111. At that rate, the membership fee would be offset in less than two purchases. Assuming 10 purchases a year, this item yields a payback score of 713, meaning the savings would cover the membership fee plus six times the cost of this item alone. Costco also sells highly rated dog food under its Kirkland Signature brand for $35 per 40-pound bag. A jumbo pack of Huggies diapers sells for $50 at Costco, while it would cost about $70 to get the same quantity (156 diapers) elsewhere. At that rate, savings on diapers alone would offset the membership fee in less than four purchases. Assuming one purchase a month yields a payback score of 373, meaning the savings would pay for the membership fee plus three times again for this item alone. Costco also sells diapers under its Kirkland Signature brand for a lower unit cost. Costco sells large containers of Similac for $55, which is about $13 less than it would cost to get the same product at a typical retailer. That means a membership fee would be offset after five purchases. Assuming one purchase a month yields a payback score of 240. Costco also sells generic baby formula at roughly half the unit cost of Similac, and Costco's offering is produced by the same leading supplier, Perrigo, that other major retailers use for their store brands. Costco sells 2-pound bags of Starbucks Pike Place roast coffee beans for $8.40 per pound, while typical retailers sell the same beans for about $12 per pound. At that rate, the savings would offset the membership fee after nine purchases, or 18 pounds of coffee. Assuming a household consumes 30 pounds of coffee a year yields a payback score of 166. Beyond Starbucks, Costco regularly features local coffee roasters and specially sourced beans from coffee-growing regions around the world at a lower cost than conventional retail. Costco has 2.5-pound blocks of Tillamook cheddar cheese for sale at $4 per pound, which is about $2.60 less per pound than typical retailers. Assuming a household uses about half a pound a week would amount to roughly 25 pounds a year. At these rates, a Costco membership would be almost equally offset by savings on cheese for a payback score of 102. Bacon is incredibly subjective. Still, the closest match found to this $4.33 per pound thick-cut bacon from Costco costs $8 per pound at a Midwestern grocery chain. At three pounds per package, that works out to a difference of $11, which would offset the membership fee after about six purchases. Assuming a household consumes 15 pounds of bacon a year would only account for five purchases for a payback score of 85. Costco sells chicken stock in packs of six quarts for $9 per pack — that's about a third of what it would cost to get the same amount of chicken stock in individual packs from a traditional retailer. Assuming three purchases a year (18 quarts total) gives a payback score of 83. Buying three pounds of Fage Total 2% Greek Yogurt at a conventional retailer would cost about $2.70 more than getting a tub from Costco. Assuming a household consumes about a pound of yogurt a week on average works out to 17 purchases a year, for a payback score of 71. One product Costco is known for is its comically large packs of paper products, like these 30-packs of Charmin toilet paper. Before discounts, the $33 pack works out to $1.10 per roll, which is 37 cents cheaper per roll than an equivalent pack bought elsewhere for $44. Assuming a household uses 10 rolls of toilet paper a month would mean four purchases a year, resulting in a payback score of 67. At $1.25 per pound, Costco's six-pack of Barilla pasta costs about $4 less than the same amount bought elsewhere. Assuming a weekly spaghetti night that uses one pound of pasta, this works out to nine purchases a year, resulting in a payback score of 54. Costco sometimes sells products in quantities that exceed a year's supply. Brita recommends changing its filters every two months, so this ten-pack would last well into next year. Still, Costco's pre-discount unit price of $4.50 is about $3 less than individual filters cost at conventional retailers. If purchased in equal quantities, the Costco pack would be about $30 less, for a payback score of 45. Cascade dishwasher pods cost about $7.30 less at Costco (before discounts) than an equivalent quantity bought at a typical retailer. If a household runs the dishwasher once a day, it would need to buy four packs in a year, which works out to a payback score of 45. Bear with us for this one. HVAC filters may seem boring, but manufacturers recommend replacing them at least every three months for optimal performance, and that can add up quickly. Costco's four-pack of 3M Filtrete air filters comes in at $28 less than the same product elsewhere. Most households will only need to buy one pack a year, though, so the payback score would be 43. It's also worth noting that there are less expensive types of HVAC filters on the market that Costco doesn't sell. The way Costco executives have described it, the company isn't looking to sell the cheapest available products; it wants to find the sweet spot that balances both high quality and low price. Opti-Free contact lens solution is about 25% less expensive by volume when purchased at Costco, compared with a traditional retailer. A household that uses about 12 ounces a month would need to buy four of these packs in the course of a year, with a payback score of 42. Shoppers can generally save money by switching from national brand medications to generics. A bottle of 365 tablets of cetirizine, better known as Zyrtec, costs $13.50 before discounts at Costco, while the same quantity from some other stores' brands can easily cost nearly $40. Still, 365 tablets are more than many households might need in a year, so a single purchase would make sense, resulting in a payback score of 40. Like medicines and meats, Costco also has low prices on cooking oils. This store-branded olive oil is about half the price per liter of a similar store-branded alternative at another retailer. Assuming a household uses three liters a year, yields a payback score of 25. This Arm & Hammer laundry detergent from Costco costs $14.89, or about $0.07 a load, versus $0.11 a load for the same product at other retailers. Assuming a household would go through two 200-ounce jugs in a year gives a payback score of 22. Like medications, generic vitamins from Costco can be extremely cost-effective — about 20% less than a similar product elsewhere. Two adults taking one daily multivitamin each would mean five purchases of these gummies in a year for a payback score of 18. Costco's $1.50 hot dog and soda combo gets a lot of attention. After all, it's not every day that an executive is explicitly warned to never raise the price. However, we crunched the numbers, and it turns out that roughly one Costco combo a month (14.4 a year, to be exact) would save you $65 compared to getting a similar meal from a chain like Portillo's or Nathan's. The bigger advantage is the jumbo pizzas for less than $10. By comparison, the largest pizza Domino's makes is 14 inches, which costs $15 and is actually about two-thirds the area of Costco's 18-inch. For the equivalent square inches of cheese or pepperoni pizza, Costco's offering is about $12 less, which means the annual fee would be offset with six pizzas. The math on the $5 rotisserie chickens is slightly less favorable to Costco, as many grocery stores offer a similar product. We'd love to hear about your best Costco picks.

After being laid off from his AI product manager role last September, one of Aman Goyal's first moves in a tough job market was to buy a book. With the 26-year-old's purchase of "Decode and Conquer," author Lewis Lin provided Goyal with access to a private Slack community with more than 20,000 professionals and job seekers. Over the next six weeks, Goyal conducted about 40 mock interviews through the community with fellow job seekers, some of them current product managers from major tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon. Goyal said the practice helped him prepare for interviews at T-Mobile, where he accepted an offer in November. "I think it's a good community for you to practice and also find some good network connections," said Goyal, who lives in Seattle. "The mock interviews helped with my confidence and just building that muscle of answering those questions spontaneously." Over the past year, I've spoken with more than a dozen people who have found ways to turn job searching into a group project. While networking is a time-tested job search strategy, these job seekers have taken it a step further: forming layoff support groups, joining exclusive networking circles, or turning to social media for feedback and encouragement.

They hoped the added support would help them break through in a market that has grown more challenging in recent years, with employers now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.

Read more on the topic: When Sreeja Apparaju began looking for a job in the fall of 2022, she turned to her most trusted network — a close circle of four friends. After the University of California, Berkeley students realized they were applying to many of the same software engineering roles, they decided to join forces: trading job leads and recruiter contacts, swapping interview tips, and offering each other moral support along the way. Apparaju said the collaboration helped her land two interviews — and ultimately, a job offer. In one case, a friend told her about a role at Palantir they'd interviewed for and shared the recruiter's email. Within a week of reaching out, Apparaju received an online assessment that led to an interview with the company. In another instance, a friend's cousin provided a referral for a software engineering role at Snap — the company behind Snapchat — where Apparaju later received and accepted an offer. Her friends also found success, with one landing a role at Amazon and another joining Salesforce. "There can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of people," said the 24-year-old, who lives in New York. "But in my experience, just sharing what you know and helping each other out was a lot easier and faster for all five of us." Looking for work alongside your closest friends is an experience that's arguably unique to a college senior. But outside that bubble, some job seekers are finding new ways to make their searches more collaborative. After 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Henderson was laid off from her user researcher role last May. After learning the news, she messaged colleagues to see who else had been affected and added them to a group chat. Over the following weeks, more than a dozen people shared job leads, helped one another prepare for interviews, vented frustrations, and celebrated successes. "The fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful," she said. In August, Henderson accepted an offer for a user experience role at Meta — a position she learned about through her network and was referred for. In the absence of formal support networks, some job seekers have turned to social platforms for help. That includes career-focused sites like LinkedIn, where many have publicly announced layoffs or added "open to work" badges — as well as broader platforms like TikTok. Last May, Andrew Z. Chen was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. So when Amazon invited him to interview for a software engineering role, he didn't want to waste the opportunity. His plan: hole up in his room to study — and document the process on TikTok to hold himself accountable. Chen said the videos — which racked up as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions. Some viewers were skeptical he could land the role given his limited prep time. But others, including people who'd interviewed at Amazon, offered encouragement and shared advice on the types of technical questions to expect. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," said Chen, who's in his 20s and lives in New York. Weeks later, he accepted the role at Amazon. Support from others navigating the job market has helped some job seekers stay motivated; however, many are still struggling to secure job offers. Last July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off from his developer relations role at Intel. He's struggled to find work, but said he's leaned on the support of former Intel colleagues who were laid off around the same time — and has helped some of them land interviews. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who is in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Beyond those connections, Ramkrishna said he's also leaned on private developer relations Slack channels and Discord servers he was invited to through conferences and past professional relationships. Some include job-specific channels where hiring managers post openings directly, he said. Apparaju said that while securing her role ultimately came down to how she performed in the interviews, the support of her friends helped her stay focused and confident throughout the process. "Having people who were cheering for you and also working hard with you was honestly so motivating," she said. "Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was an inspiration to keep pushing to crack that one job offer." Apparaju knows she'll never be able to replicate her college experience of job hunting alongside close friends, but she believes her network can still be valuable. She recently mentioned some potential openings at her company to a friend — one example, she said, of how she can keep that spirit of support alive. "Given how tough this job market is, everybody and anybody is super happy to help," she said. Jump to

Daily Tech News 11 January 2026 Top Story Meta has signed long-term contracts with three suppliers for a total of 6GW of nuclear power for its datacenters. (Tech Crunch) Two of the partners are startups developing small modular reactors; the third, Vistra, is a major operator of traditional large non-modular reactors. Meanwhile researchers in China have managed to break the Greenwald limit on the number of alt accounts a single journalist can have agreeing with his posts before he screws up. (The Independent) Wait, I'm told in this context it's an empirical limit on sustained plasma densities in Tokamak-style fusion reactors. With this breakthrough, fusion power is now only nineteen years and twelve months away. Tech News It's a water heater! It's a Bitcoin miner! It's both! (Tom's Hardware) Given that the main cost of mining Bitcoin is the energy it takes - and disposing of the waste heat somehow - why not use it for, say, heating water? The Superheat H1 does exactly that. And if the price of Bitcoin collapses, it still heats your water. Can light move faster than the speed of light? (Science Daily) Some theories of loop quantum gravity predict small fluctuations of the speed of light in a vacuum. New experiments put an upper bound on how big those fluctuations could be, ruling out some of these theories. I call them theories rather than mere speculation because they actually made sufficiently robust predictions to be ruled out in the first place. A theory can be wrong, but it's not a theory if you can't test it. Can AI do your job? (MSN) If you're a computer programmer, or you otherwise work solely with words, possibly yes. If you do literally anything else, the best AI models currently succeed at 2.5% of human tasks. AMD will be launching socketed versions of the Ryzen 400 processor series later this year. (WCCFTech) Too late, really. Zen 6 will be out this year, and if you want integrated graphics it looks like Intel's Panther Lake is faster - though only if you are willing to go with a system with soldered memory. If you need conventional DIMM or SODIMM memory, you get models cut down from 12 GPU cores to just 4, which isn't beating anything. So maybe not too late, but underwhelming. And if you want dedicated graphics, you might need to buy soon. (Tom's Hardware) Nvidia GPUs are hardest hit so far, with reports of stock on all models running low in Germany and Japan. Since that was the first direct warning we had of the memory crunch (though in retrospect the signs were there months earlier) I bought myself a 9060 XT while they were in stock and on sale. Which as of time of writing, they still are. Asus and Gigabyte are putting 64MB of ROM on their new AM5 motherboards. (Tom's Hardware) Earlier AM4 motherboards often had as little as 16MB of ROM for the BIOS, which became a problem as AMD kept releasing new chips for the platform - Socket AM4 first appeared in 2016, even before Zen 1, and the most recent new processor for that socket, the 5500X3D, was launched in June last year. There were simply too many different models of compatible processors to fit all the necessary code into 16MB. With AM5 confirmed to support the upcoming Zen 6 chips later this year, and strongly hinted to support Zen 7 due in 2028, it will end up being an even longer-lived platform with more CPUs, so motherboard makers are fixing the problem before it arises. Amazon is using AI to sell your products on their store without you having to lift a finger. (Modern Retail) Also, without Amazon ever asking permission to do so. Also also, without Amazon bothering to sync the data properly from your online store so that they don't, for example, still list long-discontinued products for sale. Store owners are not happy. NBC News is intensifying a collapse of trust online. (NBC News) No, they didn't have a brief moment of self-awareness. They're blaming three years of AI for thirty years of their own failings. Musical Interlude In 2008, a young Suzuka Nakamoto was part of a short-lived trio called Karen Girl's - yes, with the misplaced apostrophe - and performed Over the Future, the opening theme for the anime series Zettai Karen Children. You may know her better as the lead singer for Babymetal. Thanks Mikeski for pointing me to the Babymetal cover of Over the Future. (I checked three different versions of the first clip.

Speaking of data centers and water... during a county zoning meeting this past summer, the county executives were attempting to slide a center into an area of farmland being rezoned. It was revealed that the center would consume millions of gallons of water a month. More than half the current residential consumption. And up to 50% of that water evaporated during the cooling process for the processors at the datacenter. The rest wasn't recycled due to contamination and would have to stored in evaporation ponds. Half of the local, residential water would be consumed by this thing. And there was no plan to increase the water capacity. I'll note that this was only part of the county. The entire county wouldn't end up dry.... just this one, little, undeveloped area nobody seemed to notice. Except for everyone who lived there.

I believe the US moved some military assets into the region about the same time we went after that "dark fleet" oil tanker in the N. Atlantic. So... earlier this week. We already struck ISIS in Syria for killing 2 National Guard (Iowa, I think) and their American interpreter, so assets are in the region. I just think the administration doesn't quite know what to do in Iran. It's not as simple as it would seem. Wheels within wheels....

Jensen Huang took the stage at the CES trade show in Las Vegas this week to make the clearest pitch yet for Nvidia Corp.’s autonomous driving technology. In doing so, the chief executive officer’s vision for vehicles that can drive themselves edged into the terrain of major customers like Tesla Inc. and its boss, Elon Musk. Huang’s remarks sparked a widely watched — if notably polite — indirect multiday exchange between two of the most influential figures in technology. It also sharpened a central question about autonomous driving: Who controls the technology that will first power consumer cars that drive themselves — and later, driverless cars known as robotaxis that are designed for ride-hailing? And whose autonomous vehicle system is the best? On Monday, Huang used his speech to America’s largest technology showcase to extol the virtues of Nvidia’s Alpamayo, an open-source AI model designed to speed development of Level 4 self-driving cars. Such cars — consumer-owned at first, and robotaxi-fleet-operated later — can drive themselves without human supervision or intervention, within a defined geographic area. Nvidia described Alpamayo as part of a broader toolkit it offers automakers on top of open models. That includes powerful chips in data centers to train self-driving software, chips inside vehicles that serve as the car’s “brain” while it’s on the road, and simulation software that can create vast amounts of driving data virtually — reducing the time and cost of collecting it in the real world. The pitch was aimed squarely at automakers. Nvidia wants to supply the intelligence layer for autonomy without building the car itself, but it still wants to own the technology that makes self-driving a reality. “The world’s first thinking, reasoning, autonomous vehicle AI,” Huang proudly announced, clad in a shiny leather jacket. That afternoon, Musk weighed in with a post on X after a user shared a transcript of Huang’s remarks. “Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing ????,” Musk wrote. The Tesla CEO added that while getting a system to work most of the time is relatively easy, solving rare and unpredictable edge cases is far harder. The world’s richest man has claimed for a long time that Tesla’s system will have the ability to reason — that is, to make humanlike decisions in specific traffic scenarios — after a future software update. Earlier this week, his chief AI lieutenant, Ashok Elluswamy, responded to a question on X, saying a further update will come in the current quarter. Huang learned of Musk’s response during an interview with Bloomberg Television at CES the next day. “I wouldn’t be surprised,” Huang interjected, of Musk’s claim to already be doing reasoning. “I think the Tesla stack is the most advanced AV stack in the world.” Tesla shares ended the week higher by 1.6%, closing Friday at $445.01. New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, who has a buy rating and $600 price target on the stock, had posted on X earlier in the week after Huang’s keynote that Nvidia’s strategy “validated” Tesla’s approach. What drew broader attention was the tone of the aftermath of Nvidia’s announcement. The exchange went viral — not because of confrontation, but because of restraint. The two rivals acknowledged each other’s technical credibility while advancing different paths. Tesla and Nvidia already have an important, if uneven, relationship. Tesla relies heavily on Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs – the chips that go into data centers to train its autonomous driving software — even as it builds its own in-house chips to run that software inside vehicles. Musk has said Tesla will have spent roughly $10 billion cumulatively on Nvidia hardware for training by the end of this year, and that figure would be higher had it not worked on their own AI chips. Musk’s AI startup, xAI, is also a major Nvidia customer, and Nvidia is an investor in xAI. Tesla and Nvidia are fundamentally different companies. Tesla makes cars and builds the full system end to end. Nvidia builds chips and software that others use. Their technologies are different too. Tesla has a vision-only approach, just relying on camera sensors. The company argues it’s the most economically viable approach at scale and avoids sensors confusing one another. The rest of the industry argues other sensors like lidar, radar and ultrasonics are better because they are safer and offer redundancy. But the dynamic underscores how unsettled the autonomous vehicle arms race remains. Tesla depends on Nvidia to build its software, even as Nvidia builds tools that could one day help Tesla’s rivals catch up. Their paths to consumers also increasingly overlap. Tesla sells a suite of features known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised), a driver-assistance system that requires the vehicle’s operator to remain at the wheel and watch the road. The system Tesla sells is capable of point-to-point driving with navigation, lane changes and can react to traffic, but drivers still need to keep their eyes on the road. Nvidia now also sells advanced driver-assistance and autonomy platforms to automakers. And those automakers, in turn, pitch the systems to the consumer in the cars they sell. Market analysts see robotaxis as the endgame, with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo currently leading real-world commercial deployments and Tesla arguing it can win at scale. Before that, the proving ground is consumer-owned cars that can do more of the driving themselves under owner supervision, serving as a bridge toward wider robotaxi adoption. Tesla sees FSD as a stepping stone to a future robotaxi network it would control. Nvidia is pursuing a similar endgame, working with other technology companies, automakers and ride-hailing companies, including Uber Technologies Inc. Again, Nvidia would just provide the tech and sees it powering fleets of robotaxis as soon as 2027. Tesla is betting on winning autonomy as a specialist, while Nvidia is positioning itself as the arms dealer, selling tools to the entire industry. Huang said the upcoming Mercedes-Benz CLA will be the first car to use Nvidia’s stack, offering FSD-like capabilities. Deliveries are starting in the US in early 2026 and rolling out to Europe and Asia later in the year. Moving beyond that would require additional hardware, such as lidar, adding cost and underscoring how far today’s cars remain from full autonomy. Musk returned to the subject of Nvidia’s push into autonomous vehicles on Tuesday, arguing it posed little immediate threat to Tesla’s efforts. The technology, he said, was far from being ready to be rolled out safely on a large scale. “The actual time from when FSD sort of works to where it is much safer than a human is several years,” he wrote on X, adding that meaningful competition for Tesla could still be at least five or six years away. For all the ambition on display, Huang and Musk have both effectively indicated that fully autonomous driving at scale is still a distant prospect. And for both, the nearer proving ground comes first: cars that can drive themselves part of the way. Who wins that phase may help decide who dominates the next one.

UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s. IBM was the dominant force early on, but it was far from the only player that attempted to compete at the silicon level. A long list of RISC vendors and alternative architectures emerged during that period – including Sun Microsystems Inc. – many of which are now footnotes in computing history. The slide above highlights this reality. The companies shown in green are the ones that managed to make it through the knothole. The rest did not. The central reason comes down to the fact that Intel delivered relentless consistency with predictable, sustained improvement in performance and price-performance, roughly doubling every two years. Intel never took its foot off the pedal. It executed Moore’s Law as an operational discipline as well as a technology roadmap. As a result, competitors simply could not keep pace. Even strong architectural ideas from industry leaders were overwhelmed by Intel’s scale, manufacturing advantage, volume economics and cadence. One point worth noting. Apple, while not always viewed as a direct silicon competitor during that era, ultimately won by controlling its system architecture and, later, by vertically integrating its silicon strategy. The broader takeaway is fundamental in our assumptions for the rest of this analysis. Specifically, in platform markets driven by learning curves, volume and compounding economics, dominance is not just about having a great product. Success requires sustained momentum over long periods of time, while competitors exhaust themselves trying to catch up. Let’s now double down on the companies that actually survived the Intel-dominated PC era. The list below is instructive in our view. AMD, Acorn (the original Arm), Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel and Nvidia. Each followed a different path, but they share a common underlying characteristic which is volume. AMD’s survival traces directly back to IBM’s original PC strategy. IBM mandated a second-source supplier, forcing Intel to share its instruction sets. AMD became that second source, and no other company gained comparable access. That structural advantage persisted for decades and allowed AMD to remain viable long after other x86 challengers disappeared. ARM, TSMC and Apple fundamentally changed the prevailing belief – stated by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders— that “real men own fabs.” These companies proved that separating design from manufacturing could be a winning strategy. Apple brought massive system-level volume. TSMC rode that volume to drive down costs, ultimately achieving manufacturing economics that we estimate to be roughly 30% lower than Intel’s. Nvidia followed a similar fabless path, pairing architectural leadership with accelerating demand. Intel itself was the original volume powerhouse, benefiting from the virtuous cycle created by the Wintel combination. That volume allowed Intel to outlast RISC competitors and dominate the PC era. But in the current cycle, Intel has lost ground to Arm-based designs, Nvidia and TSMC – each of which now rides on steeper learning curves. The takeaway is that volume is volume is fundamental to dominance. Not just volume in a single narrow segment, but volume across adjacent and synergistic markets that feed the same learning curves. AMD’s volume was initially forced by IBM’s PC division mandating a second source to Intel. Apple’s volume is consumer-driven. TSMC’s volume is manufacturing-led. Nvidia’s volume is now accelerating faster than any of them in this era. In our view, Nvidia is positioned to be the dominant volume leader of the AI era by a wide margin. And as history shows, once volume leadership is established at scale, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for competitors to catch up without other factors affecting the outcome (e.g. self-inflicted wounds or things out of the leader’s control such as geopolitical shifts). Nvidia’s CES announcements were visionary and focused largely on the emerging robotics market. In this analysis, however, we focused in on the core of Nvidia’s systems business. In our view, what Nvidia announced in this regard exceeded even our optimistic expectations. As we’ve stressed often, Nvidia is remarkable, not only because of a single chip, but because of the scope of what it delivers. Specifically, Huang led this part of his keynote with a six-chip, full-system redesign built around what Huang consistently refers to as extreme co-design. The chart above shows the next generation innovations from Nvidia, including Vera Rubin, named in homage to the astronomer whose work on galactic rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter. Vera is the CPU. Rubin is the GPU. But focusing only on those two components misses the broader story. Nvidia simultaneously advanced every major silicon element in the system including NVLink based on InfiniBand, ConnectX nics and Spectrum-X for Ethernet, BlueField DPUs and Spectrum-X Ethernet with co-packaged optics. A few years ago, the prevailing narrative suggested that Ethernet would undercut Nvidia’s proprietary networking position, the underpinning which was Infiniband (via the Covid-era Mellanox acquisition). Nvidia was undeterred and responded by building Spectrum-X. Today, Jensen Huang argues that Nvidia is the largest networking company in the world by revenue, and the claim appears credible. What’s striking is not the line extension itself, but the speed and completeness with which Nvidia executed it. The deeper point lies in how Nvidia defines co-design. While the company works closely with customers such as OpenAI Group PBC, Google LLC with Gemini and xAI Corp., the co-design begins internally – across Nvidia’s own portfolio. This generation represents a ground-up redesign of the entire machine. Every major chip has been enhanced in coordination, not in isolation. The performance metrics are astounding. The GPU delivers roughly a fivefold performance improvement. The CPUs see substantial gains as well. But equally important are the advances in networking – both within the rack and across racks. Each subsystem was redesigned together to maximize end-to-end throughput rather than optimize any single component in isolation. The result is multiplicative, not additive. While individual elements show performance gains on the order of five times, the system-level throughput improvement is closer to an order of magnitude. That is the payoff of extreme co-design – aligning compute, networking, memory and software to minimize single bottlenecks that limit the overall system. In our view, this marks a decisive shift in how AI infrastructure is built. For quite some time we’ve acknowledged that Nvidia is no longer shipping chips. It is delivering tightly integrated systems engineered to maximize throughput, utilization, and economic efficiency at the scale required for AI factories. That distinction is profound as competitors attempt to match not just component performance, but the learning-curve advantages that emerge when volume, architecture and system-level design reinforce each other. While Jensen has pointed out that Nvidia is a full systems player, the point is often lost on investors and market watchers. This announcement further underscores the importance of this design philosophy and further differentiates Nvidia from any competitor. A critical point that becomes more clear from Nvidia’s announcements is the chip is not the correct unit of measurement. The system is. More precisely, the rack – and ultimately the token output per rack – is what defines performance, economics, and value. Each rack integrates 72 GPUs along with CPUs and high-speed interconnects that bind the system together. Compute density is critical, but so is the ability to move data with minimal jitter and maximum consistency – within the rack, across racks, and across entire frames. Nvidia has dramatically increased memory capacity into the terabytes, enabling GPUs to operate in tight coordination without stalling. The result is coherent execution at massive scale. These systems are designed to scale up, scale out, and scale across. When deployed at full factory scale, they operate not in dozens or hundreds of GPUs, but in hundreds of thousands – eventually up to a million GPUs working together. As scale increases, so does throughput. And as throughput increases, the economic value of the tokens generated accelerates. This is where the numbers compound to create the flywheel effect. Roughly five times performance improvement at the component level combines with roughly ten times throughput at the system level. Together, they drive what we believe is an estimated 15-times increase in demand, as lower cost per token unlocks entirely new classes of workloads. This is Moore’s Law on triple steroids – and it explains why annual value creation rises so sharply. The Jevons Paradox applies here. As the efficiency of token generation improves, total consumption rises. As we’ve stressed, the value shifts away from static measures of chip performance, toward dynamic measures of system utilization and output economics. The faster tokens can be generated, the more economically viable it becomes to deploy AI at scale, and the more demand expands. Networking is central to this equation. Nvidia’s long-term investment in Mellanox – once dismissed by many as a bet on a dying technology – now looks prescient. InfiniBand continues to grow rapidly, even as Ethernet demand also accelerates. Far from being a bottleneck, networking has become a core enabler of system-level performance. The takeaway is that AI infrastructure economics are now defined at the rack and factory level, not at the chip level. Nvidia’s advantage lies in designing systems where compute, memory, networking and software operate as a single, tightly coordinated machine. That is where throughput is maximized, token economics are transformed, and the next phase of AI factory value is being created. Huang presented three critical metrics on a single slide to show training throughput, AI factory token throughput and token cost. Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster. Training velocity becomes a competitive advantage in itself, not just a cost consideration. In our view, this is one of the most under-appreciated dynamics in the current AI race. The factory throughput chart above on the right, tells an equally important story. As workloads shift from batch inference toward interactive, agent-driven use cases, throughput characteristics change dramatically. Tokens per query increase. Latency sensitivity rises. Under these conditions, Blackwell’s throughput collapses as shown. Meanwhile, Rubin sustains performance far more effectively and delivers approximately 10 times more tokens per month at the factory level. This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability. In our view, many observers continue to underestimate both the pace at which Nvidia is moving and the magnitude of the gap it is creating. Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute. It is training velocity, sustained factory throughput and token economics at scale. And on those dimensions, Nvidia is setting the bar. The final piece of the equation that we’ll dig into is cost. And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain. But from the perspective of an AI factory operator, the math dominates everything else. If cost per token falls while throughput rises dramatically, the earning power of the factory increases materially. This is especially critical in a power-constrained world as we described last August when we explored the “New Jensen’s Law.” Hyperscalers and neoclouds alike are limited by available power, not just capital. Under those constraints, Jensen’s tongue-in-cheek “law” applies – buy more, make more; or buy more, save more. The ability to extract significantly more work from the same infrastructure — or achieve the same output with far less — translates directly into financial operating leverage. The example Jensen cited makes the point concrete. In a $50 billion, gigawatt-scale data center, improving utilization by 10% produces an enormous $5 billion benefit that flows straight to the income statement. That is why networking, in this context, becomes economically “free.” The incremental cost is dwarfed by the utilization gains it enables. This is ultimately why Nvidia’s position is so strong. The advantage is not just technical – it’s economic. Nvidia is operating on a steep learning curve, reinforced by volume, system-level co-design and accelerating efficiency gains. When cost per token collapses at this rate, demand expands, utilization rises and the economics compound. That dynamic is what defines leadership in this era. We’ll close by translating the CES announcements into competitive implications across multiple classes of players, including vendors that are simultaneously customers. The common theme is that the unit of competition has shifted from chips to systems, racks and ultimately token economics. That shift changes the survivability economics for incumbents, the opportunity for specialists, and the urgency of customer strategies. In our view, it’s effectively game over for Intel’s historical monopoly and leadership position. The more interesting question is whether Intel can remain a meaningful CPU provider in an AI factory world – and the Nvidia/Intel interoperability move is notable in that context. The historical context is relevant. Nvidia has wanted deeper access to x86 since the late 1990s but was never allowed. The new arrangement changes the structure and it enables a configuration where Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs can operate within the same frame. It’s not a fully unified architecture, but it is sufficient for most of the work, and it creates a practical path for Intel CPUs to remain present in these systems. It also gives Intel a meaningful level of access to CUDA-based environments – short of “full access,” but still consequential. The net effect should improve Intel connectivity in these deployments, keep Intel in the CPU game for this cycle, and increase the volume of Nvidia systems available to the market. In other words, it can act as a viable bridge from the old to the new, which is good for customers. We do want to flag a key risk to any optimistic Nvidia scenario – a Taiwan geopolitical disruption. If China takes over Taiwan, there are multiple potential outcomes – from continuity with a new lever for China, to a more disruptive scenario if that lever is pulled. Either would ripple through sentiment around Nvidia and could increase perceived strategic value for Intel. But the hard reality is Intel still has to close the manufacturing and execution gap with TSMC, and that is not something any company can leapfrog overnight. AMD has executed well against Intel in x86. But the competitive target has shifted. x86 is mature and its curve has flattened, which made the timing right for AMD’s ascdendency and for hyperscalers to pursue alternatives such as AWS’ Graviton. AMD is now taking on a very different animal – a leader moving on a steep learning curve with compounding system-level advantages. In our view, the core issue is speed. AMD will struggle to move fast enough to close a gap defined by 12-month cycles and system-level throughput economics. One practical implication is that AMD should pursue a deal structure similar to Intel’s – something that secures volume on one side – while focusing aggressively on the edge. Data center CPU revenue is meaningful for Intel and AMD, but expanding volume there will be difficult, and there is real risk of decline. The edge remains wide open, and that’s where focus should go in our opinion. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia is also targeting the edge – autonomous vehicle libraries were highlighted and robotics were put on stage at CES and it’s a major focus of the company. The edge is open, but it won’t be uncontested. There is ample room for specialists that avoid direct, frontal competition with Nvidia. The AI factory buildout is forecast to be enormous – large enough that niche and adjacency strategies can still create meaningful businesses, particularly around factories and the edge. Two examples we cite: But the strategic point is that latency is a real lever in inference economics, and specialists that win on latency can matter – especially at the edge. Broadcom is best understood as a critical supplier to hyperscalers, OEM ecosystems, mobile players and virtually all forms of connectivity. Broadcom has a custom silicon engine that manages back-end execution with foundries and manufacturing partners. Its business is diversified and structurally important, and we do not view it as going away by any means. Broadcom has deep engineering talent and a diversified business with exceptional leadership. The more controversial question is whether hyperscalers should continue investing in alternative accelerators such as TPUs, Trainium and other ASIC strategies – as a long-term path to compete with Nvidia. Google has deep history and real technical credibility with TPUs. But the argument here is that this is now a different business environment. Google must protect search quality and accelerate Gemini. If internal platform choices limit developer access to CUDA and the best available hardware/software improvements, the risk is that Gemini’s development velocity slows. If model iteration takes multiples longer, that becomes strategically dangerous. Our view is that TPUs have reached a ceiling in this context – not because they can’t improve, but because they cannot match Nvidia’s volume-driven learning curve and system-level economics, particularly with networking as scale. A related point, made by Gavin Baker using a simplified economics example is if Google’s TPU program represents a $30 billion business, and it sends a large portion of value to Broadcom (about $15 billion), one might argue for vertical integration. The counterargument here is that even if it’s financially possible, it may be strategically irrational if it slows Gemini’s iteration speed. The core thesis is that Google should prioritize model velocity over accelerator self-sufficiency. The same logic extends to Trainium. AWS’ Graviton playbook worked because it targeted a mature, flattening x86 curve. That is not the environment in accelerators today. The pace is too fast, the curves are too steep, and the system complexity is too high. Will AWS, Google and even Microsoft continue to fund alternatives to Nvidia? Probably as use cases will emerge for more cost effective platforms. But the real strategic advantage for hyperscalers in our view lies elsewhere, especially as they face increasing competition from neoclouds. We position four frontier labs as the primary contenders: OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Google and xAI Corp.’s Grok, with Meta Platforms Inc.treated as a second tier (with the caveat that it’s unwise to count Zuckerberg out). Despite persistent negative narratives around OpenAI — especially around financing structure and commitments — our view is that pessimism may be misplaced. The reasoning is as follows: In short, we see the winners as OpenAI the most likely overall winner in the center, with Anthropic as the second player, and Grok highly likely to do well at the edge. Elon could also compete strongly at the edge while he backed away from the idea of building his own data center chips. An additional allocation nuance is labs aligned with Nvidia (OpenAI and X.ai) may have a better path to “latest and greatest” allocations than those pursuing tighter coupling with alternative accelerator strategies. For OEMs like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, the opportunity is primarily executional. In other words, get the latest platforms, package them, deliver them, and keep them running reliably without thermal or integration failures. Demand is enormous, supply is constrained, and this is not a zero-sum game. For now they can all do well. The key point is that as long as the market remains supply-constrained, anything credible that can be produced will be consumed. That reality can justify multiple silicon suppliers from the ecosystem – even if the long-run competitive curve still favors Nvidia. On the customer side, we challenge a widely repeated narrative to “get your data house in order before you spend on AI.” The view here is that this sequencing can be backwards. Our modeling suggests that over a multiyear period (for example, five years), getting onto the AI learning curve earlier can generate substantially more value than delaying until data is “clean.” Even if data isn’t pristine, organizations can choose a dataset, apply AI to improve it, and compound learning rather than waiting. Two additional implications are highlighted below: Our strategy recommendation is to optimize for speed and learning. Put token capacity close to data (latency matters), use tokens to improve access and data quality, then iterate through AI projects quickly – one project, learn, then the next, building a flywheel. The emphasis should be on starting from value and using intelligence to improve the systems, rather than spending years trying to perfect data first. In our view, the defining lesson of this analysis is that AI is no longer a contest of individual chips, models, or even vendors – it is a contest of learning curves, systems and economics. History shows that in platform transitions, leadership accrues to those who achieve volume, sustain execution and convert efficiency gains into expanding demand. That dynamic shaped the PC era, and it is repeating at far greater speed in the AI factory era. What differentiates this cycle is the compression of time. Improvements that once unfolded over decades are now occurring in 12-month intervals, resetting cost structures and forcing strategic decisions faster than most organizations are accustomed to making them. The implications go across silicon providers, hyperscalers, AI labs, OEMs and enterprises alike. For customers, the message is value will accrue to those who get onto the AI learning curve early, focus on throughput and token economics, and build momentum through rapid iteration rather than waiting for perfect conditions. For vendors, survival will depend less on clever alternatives and more on whether they can stay on the steepest curves without slowing themselves down. This transition will not be linear, and it will not be evenly distributed. But the direction is clear in our view.

UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s. IBM was the dominant force early on, but it was far from the only player that attempted to compete at the silicon level. A long list of RISC vendors and alternative architectures emerged during that period – including Sun Microsystems Inc. – many of which are now footnotes in computing history. The slide above highlights this reality. The companies shown in green are the ones that managed to make it through the knothole. The rest did not. The central reason comes down to the fact that Intel delivered relentless consistency with predictable, sustained improvement in performance and price-performance, roughly doubling every two years. Intel never took its foot off the pedal. It executed Moore’s Law as an operational discipline as well as a technology roadmap. As a result, competitors simply could not keep pace. Even strong architectural ideas from industry leaders were overwhelmed by Intel’s scale, manufacturing advantage, volume economics and cadence. One point worth noting. Apple, while not always viewed as a direct silicon competitor during that era, ultimately won by controlling its system architecture and, later, by vertically integrating its silicon strategy. The broader takeaway is fundamental in our assumptions for the rest of this analysis. Specifically, in platform markets driven by learning curves, volume and compounding economics, dominance is not just about having a great product. Success requires sustained momentum over long periods of time, while competitors exhaust themselves trying to catch up. Let’s now double down on the companies that actually survived the Intel-dominated PC era. The list below is instructive in our view. AMD, Acorn (the original Arm), Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel and Nvidia. Each followed a different path, but they share a common underlying characteristic which is volume. AMD’s survival traces directly back to IBM’s original PC strategy. IBM mandated a second-source supplier, forcing Intel to share its instruction sets. AMD became that second source, and no other company gained comparable access. That structural advantage persisted for decades and allowed AMD to remain viable long after other x86 challengers disappeared. ARM, TSMC and Apple fundamentally changed the prevailing belief – stated by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders— that “real men own fabs.” These companies proved that separating design from manufacturing could be a winning strategy. Apple brought massive system-level volume. TSMC rode that volume to drive down costs, ultimately achieving manufacturing economics that we estimate to be roughly 30% lower than Intel’s. Nvidia followed a similar fabless path, pairing architectural leadership with accelerating demand. Intel itself was the original volume powerhouse, benefiting from the virtuous cycle created by the Wintel combination. That volume allowed Intel to outlast RISC competitors and dominate the PC era. But in the current cycle, Intel has lost ground to Arm-based designs, Nvidia and TSMC – each of which now rides on steeper learning curves. The takeaway is that volume is volume is fundamental to dominance. Not just volume in a single narrow segment, but volume across adjacent and synergistic markets that feed the same learning curves. AMD’s volume was initially forced by IBM’s PC division mandating a second source to Intel. Apple’s volume is consumer-driven. TSMC’s volume is manufacturing-led. Nvidia’s volume is now accelerating faster than any of them in this era. In our view, Nvidia is positioned to be the dominant volume leader of the AI era by a wide margin. And as history shows, once volume leadership is established at scale, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for competitors to catch up without other factors affecting the outcome (e.g. self-inflicted wounds or things out of the leader’s control such as geopolitical shifts). Nvidia’s CES announcements were visionary and focused largely on the emerging robotics market. In this analysis, however, we focused in on the core of Nvidia’s systems business. In our view, what Nvidia announced in this regard exceeded even our optimistic expectations. As we’ve stressed often, Nvidia is remarkable, not only because of a single chip, but because of the scope of what it delivers. Specifically, Huang led this part of his keynote with a six-chip, full-system redesign built around what Huang consistently refers to as extreme co-design. The chart above shows the next generation innovations from Nvidia, including Vera Rubin, named in homage to the astronomer whose work on galactic rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter. Vera is the CPU. Rubin is the GPU. But focusing only on those two components misses the broader story. Nvidia simultaneously advanced every major silicon element in the system including NVLink based on InfiniBand, ConnectX nics and Spectrum-X for Ethernet, BlueField DPUs and Spectrum-X Ethernet with co-packaged optics. A few years ago, the prevailing narrative suggested that Ethernet would undercut Nvidia’s proprietary networking position, the underpinning which was Infiniband (via the Covid-era Mellanox acquisition). Nvidia was undeterred and responded by building Spectrum-X. Today, Jensen Huang argues that Nvidia is the largest networking company in the world by revenue, and the claim appears credible. What’s striking is not the line extension itself, but the speed and completeness with which Nvidia executed it. The deeper point lies in how Nvidia defines co-design. While the company works closely with customers such as OpenAI Group PBC, Google LLC with Gemini and xAI Corp., the co-design begins internally – across Nvidia’s own portfolio. This generation represents a ground-up redesign of the entire machine. Every major chip has been enhanced in coordination, not in isolation. The performance metrics are astounding. The GPU delivers roughly a fivefold performance improvement. The CPUs see substantial gains as well. But equally important are the advances in networking – both within the rack and across racks. Each subsystem was redesigned together to maximize end-to-end throughput rather than optimize any single component in isolation. The result is multiplicative, not additive. While individual elements show performance gains on the order of five times, the system-level throughput improvement is closer to an order of magnitude. That is the payoff of extreme co-design – aligning compute, networking, memory and software to minimize single bottlenecks that limit the overall system. In our view, this marks a decisive shift in how AI infrastructure is built. For quite some time we’ve acknowledged that Nvidia is no longer shipping chips. It is delivering tightly integrated systems engineered to maximize throughput, utilization, and economic efficiency at the scale required for AI factories. That distinction is profound as competitors attempt to match not just component performance, but the learning-curve advantages that emerge when volume, architecture and system-level design reinforce each other. While Jensen has pointed out that Nvidia is a full systems player, the point is often lost on investors and market watchers. This announcement further underscores the importance of this design philosophy and further differentiates Nvidia from any competitor. A critical point that becomes more clear from Nvidia’s announcements is the chip is not the correct unit of measurement. The system is. More precisely, the rack – and ultimately the token output per rack – is what defines performance, economics, and value. Each rack integrates 72 GPUs along with CPUs and high-speed interconnects that bind the system together. Compute density is critical, but so is the ability to move data with minimal jitter and maximum consistency – within the rack, across racks, and across entire frames. Nvidia has dramatically increased memory capacity into the terabytes, enabling GPUs to operate in tight coordination without stalling. The result is coherent execution at massive scale. These systems are designed to scale up, scale out, and scale across. When deployed at full factory scale, they operate not in dozens or hundreds of GPUs, but in hundreds of thousands – eventually up to a million GPUs working together. As scale increases, so does throughput. And as throughput increases, the economic value of the tokens generated accelerates. This is where the numbers compound to create the flywheel effect. Roughly five times performance improvement at the component level combines with roughly ten times throughput at the system level. Together, they drive what we believe is an estimated 15-times increase in demand, as lower cost per token unlocks entirely new classes of workloads. This is Moore’s Law on triple steroids – and it explains why annual value creation rises so sharply. The Jevons Paradox applies here. As the efficiency of token generation improves, total consumption rises. As we’ve stressed, the value shifts away from static measures of chip performance, toward dynamic measures of system utilization and output economics. The faster tokens can be generated, the more economically viable it becomes to deploy AI at scale, and the more demand expands. Networking is central to this equation. Nvidia’s long-term investment in Mellanox – once dismissed by many as a bet on a dying technology – now looks prescient. InfiniBand continues to grow rapidly, even as Ethernet demand also accelerates. Far from being a bottleneck, networking has become a core enabler of system-level performance. The takeaway is that AI infrastructure economics are now defined at the rack and factory level, not at the chip level. Nvidia’s advantage lies in designing systems where compute, memory, networking and software operate as a single, tightly coordinated machine. That is where throughput is maximized, token economics are transformed, and the next phase of AI factory value is being created. Huang presented three critical metrics on a single slide to show training throughput, AI factory token throughput and token cost. Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster. Training velocity becomes a competitive advantage in itself, not just a cost consideration. In our view, this is one of the most under-appreciated dynamics in the current AI race. The factory throughput chart above on the right, tells an equally important story. As workloads shift from batch inference toward interactive, agent-driven use cases, throughput characteristics change dramatically. Tokens per query increase. Latency sensitivity rises. Under these conditions, Blackwell’s throughput collapses as shown. Meanwhile, Rubin sustains performance far more effectively and delivers approximately 10 times more tokens per month at the factory level. This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability. In our view, many observers continue to underestimate both the pace at which Nvidia is moving and the magnitude of the gap it is creating. Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute. It is training velocity, sustained factory throughput and token economics at scale. And on those dimensions, Nvidia is setting the bar. The final piece of the equation that we’ll dig into is cost. And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain. But from the perspective of an AI factory operator, the math dominates everything else. If cost per token falls while throughput rises dramatically, the earning power of the factory increases materially. This is especially critical in a power-constrained world as we described last August when we explored the “New Jensen’s Law.” Hyperscalers and neoclouds alike are limited by available power, not just capital. Under those constraints, Jensen’s tongue-in-cheek “law” applies – buy more, make more; or buy more, save more. The ability to extract significantly more work from the same infrastructure — or achieve the same output with far less — translates directly into financial operating leverage. The example Jensen cited makes the point concrete. In a $50 billion, gigawatt-scale data center, improving utilization by 10% produces an enormous $5 billion benefit that flows straight to the income statement. That is why networking, in this context, becomes economically “free.” The incremental cost is dwarfed by the utilization gains it enables. This is ultimately why Nvidia’s position is so strong. The advantage is not just technical – it’s economic. Nvidia is operating on a steep learning curve, reinforced by volume, system-level co-design and accelerating efficiency gains. When cost per token collapses at this rate, demand expands, utilization rises and the economics compound. That dynamic is what defines leadership in this era. We’ll close by translating the CES announcements into competitive implications across multiple classes of players, including vendors that are simultaneously customers. The common theme is that the unit of competition has shifted from chips to systems, racks and ultimately token economics. That shift changes the survivability economics for incumbents, the opportunity for specialists, and the urgency of customer strategies. In our view, it’s effectively game over for Intel’s historical monopoly and leadership position. The more interesting question is whether Intel can remain a meaningful CPU provider in an AI factory world – and the Nvidia/Intel interoperability move is notable in that context. The historical context is relevant. Nvidia has wanted deeper access to x86 since the late 1990s but was never allowed. The new arrangement changes the structure and it enables a configuration where Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs can operate within the same frame. It’s not a fully unified architecture, but it is sufficient for most of the work, and it creates a practical path for Intel CPUs to remain present in these systems. It also gives Intel a meaningful level of access to CUDA-based environments – short of “full access,” but still consequential. The net effect should improve Intel connectivity in these deployments, keep Intel in the CPU game for this cycle, and increase the volume of Nvidia systems available to the market. In other words, it can act as a viable bridge from the old to the new, which is good for customers. We do want to flag a key risk to any optimistic Nvidia scenario – a Taiwan geopolitical disruption. If China takes over Taiwan, there are multiple potential outcomes – from continuity with a new lever for China, to a more disruptive scenario if that lever is pulled. Either would ripple through sentiment around Nvidia and could increase perceived strategic value for Intel. But the hard reality is Intel still has to close the manufacturing and execution gap with TSMC, and that is not something any company can leapfrog overnight. AMD has executed well against Intel in x86. But the competitive target has shifted. x86 is mature and its curve has flattened, which made the timing right for AMD’s ascdendency and for hyperscalers to pursue alternatives such as AWS’ Graviton. AMD is now taking on a very different animal – a leader moving on a steep learning curve with compounding system-level advantages. In our view, the core issue is speed. AMD will struggle to move fast enough to close a gap defined by 12-month cycles and system-level throughput economics. One practical implication is that AMD should pursue a deal structure similar to Intel’s – something that secures volume on one side – while focusing aggressively on the edge. Data center CPU revenue is meaningful for Intel and AMD, but expanding volume there will be difficult, and there is real risk of decline.

The edge is open, but it won’t be uncontested. There is ample room for specialists that avoid direct, frontal competition with Nvidia.

Kansas City police Officer Matt Masters first used a Taser in the early 2000s. He said it worked well for taking people down; it was safe and effective. “At the end of the day, if you have to put your hands on somebody, you got to scuffle with somebody, why risk that?” he said. “You can just shoot them with a Taser.” Masters believed in that until his son Bryce was pulled over by an officer and shocked for more than 20 seconds. The 17-year-old went into cardiac arrest, which doctors later attributed to the Taser. Masters’ training had led him to believe something like that could never happen. This week on Reveal, we partner with Lava for Good’s podcast Absolute: Taser Incorporated and its host, Nick Berardini, to learn what the company that makes the Taser knew about the dangers of its weapon and didn’t say.

Title: Investor Michael Burry reveals options bet against Oracle
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/10/big-short-investor-michael-burry-put-options-bet-oracle-stock-orcl/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T15:41:53Z

Michael Burry, the famed investor who has drawn attention in recent months for criticism of the artificial intelligence boom, is betting against Oracle Corp. Burry owns put options on Oracle shares, he said in a Substack post after markets closed on Friday. Puts typically increase in value as the price of the underlying asset falls. Burry, who revealed bearish bets against AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc. in November, also directly shorted Oracle during the last six months, he said. Oracle is known for its database software but has recently pushed aggressively into cloud-computing services, requiring a costly build out of data center capacity, for which it is taking on significant debt. “I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making. It did not need to do what it is doing, and I do not know why it is doing this. Maybe ego,” Burry wrote in response to a reader who asked why he had decided to bet against Nvidia and not Oracle. He didn’t disclose details about the put options. The view follows a volatile year for Oracle shares. The stock jumped 36% in a single session in September after the company issued a bullish forecast for its cloud business, signaling surging demand tied to artificial intelligence. Those gains quickly faded, however, as investors focused on rising capital expenditures, questions around the structure of some cloud deals and a swelling debt load linked to data-center expansion. Oracle finished the year about 40% below its September peak. Oracle has about $95 billion of debt outstanding, making it the biggest corporate issuer outside the financial sector in the Bloomberg high-grade index. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Burry, who became famous for betting against the US housing market during the 2008 financial crisis, said he has avoided shorting larger technology companies whose businesses extend well beyond AI, citing Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as examples. “If I short Meta, I’m also shorting its social media and advertising dominance. If I short Alphabet, I’m shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc. If I short Microsoft, I’m shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,” Burry wrote. “The big ones are not pure shorts on AI.” Those companies, he said, are likely to rein in spending over time, absorb losses from overbuilt capacity and potentially write down assets, while remaining dominant in their core businesses. “These three will not go away,” he added. He said he would short OpenAI at a $500 billion valuation, underscoring his broader skepticism about the pace and economics of the AI buildout. Burry described Nvidia as the most concentrated way to express a bearish view on the artificial intelligence trade. “Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,” he wrote. “So shorting it is cheap, and its puts are cheaper than some of the other big shorts out there that are more doubted.”

Title: Weekend reading: Alas Smith and the active investing Joneses

Time Published: 2026-01-10T11:36:55Z

What caught my eye this week. The formerly fêted fund manager Terry Smith has had a few rough years in the markets, but last year was a doozy. The UK investors who once poured money into his flagship Fundsmith vehicle saw their domestic market deliver nearly 26% in 2025. A global tracker – a better comparison for the free-roaming Fundsmith – delivered roughly 14%. But Fundsmith managed just a 0.8% return. Barely there, and handily outpaced by cash in the bank. Now Terry Smith is a big and famously acerbic boy who has rained on many a parade over his long career. While the schadenfreude must be positively Wagnerian in some quarters and it’s never nice to kick a man while he’s down, he doesn’t need me defending him. I will just a tad though. Like Nick Train – another once-loved but now seemingly reviled fund manager 1 – Smith invests exclusively in ‘quality’ type shares. This doesn’t (just) mean ‘quality’ the way a car salesman might quip about that vehicle you’re eyeing up. The quality factor describes a particular kind of company that boasts – among other things – high returns on equity, strong profit margins, and the ability to turn most of its profit into cash. And since the reset of 2022, these kinds of companies have been in the doghouse. I know because I favour them with my stock picking myself. Although happily my returns in 2025 were an order of magnitude better than Smith’s. (But now I’m doing the schadenfreude dance…) Of course, Smith and Train didn’t exactly call out the tailwinds that boosted their returns during the low interest rate era. Worrywarts like me saw ‘bond proxy’ companies increasingly owned by weak hands who would rather be invested in bonds, and which were thus primed for a fall when interest rates rose. Train in particular dismissed such concerns, while Smith just continued to talk like you’d need a lobotomy to own anything other than his favoured firms. But when the reckoning came, those multiples duly corrected – and the share prices went south. The fact that even good investors suffer when their style is out of favour is of course another of the many arguments for passive investing. I’m one of diminishing band who still believes both Smith and Train have skill. But I also think most people should invest the bulk of their money in index funds, rather than bet their net worth on either the jockey or the horse they’re riding. However Smith has continued to lend his voice to the chorus warning that those same index funds are part of a wider problem. In his letter to investors this week, he recapped the now-common argument that the growing share of money invested in index funds is distorting the market, concluding: …even if we are right in diagnosing this move to index funds as one of the causes of our recent underperformance and it is laying the foundations of a major investment disaster, I have no clue how or when it will end except to say badly. He would say that, wouldn’t he? He’s an active fund manager. Well no. The greatest active investor of all-time, Warren Buffett, cheerily urges people – including his wife – to put their money into tracker funds. For my part, I am not sure exactly what I think. While Smith’s recap in his letter on the perils of excessive indexing is uncharacteristically muddled, I’ve read more persuasive arguments as to why the weight of money in index funds is distorting prices. At least at the margin and especially for the biggest companies. (Here’s the latest). I’ve also read comprehensive counters too. Now you may wonder why someone who has been writing a blog about both active and passive investing for 20 years cannot be more definitive about this? The truth is the maths is non-trivial and it’d take a good chunk of time to separate theoretical outcomes from any real-world implications. So I’m leaving it to the investing titans to argue it out. With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do. But whether they will be enough to make any meaningful difference – let alone be something that should prompt everyday investors to return to paying the known cost of active investing – is another matter altogether. On a practical level, if I was a passive investor I might favour equal-weighted funds a bit more, though that’s been a losing bet for years. Then I’d wait to see what happens! There’s no world in which index funds crash while a preponderance of active funds soar, that’s for sure. Remember, active funds basically are the market. 2 If passive and index investing has been unduly inflating prices, then beyond the edge cases it’s doing it for all investors. Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Surely this idea that indexing is causing overvalution is absolute nonsense? Like before indexing we never had overvaluation/ undervaluation in the market? Look at 1929, and more recently the late 1990s bubble and the subsequent drop after 1999. Human nature causes bubbles and their collapse, not indexing. @Indexing — Agree with the historical perspective. I’d have a read of the literature though before using the phrase “absolute nonsense”. If I was going to redux the argument down, it’s something like passive investing flows into the very largest index funds are sort of like a valuation agnostic active momentum fund funelling money into the market. (Remember, even index funds are ‘active’ in that they follow rules as to what firms to include and exclude, and in what weightings). So in that sense it’s the same as it ever was — just like big active funds in the 1960s or the late 1990s — but under a new guise. There’s then a bunch of maths overlaid onto that about demand/supply inelasticity and whatnot. In a simple world as I understood it, index funds just bought ‘the market’ and active funds traded against each other and were the market. But there are coherent arguments that at this scale quantity has a quality all of its own, as Napoleon said. Still, as noted in the piece, I’m not persuaded it’s an argument for active investing unless you want to go *very* active (e.g. buying small cap active funds to avoid an alleged large cap bubble) and that comes with a plethora of very known and real issues. If any bubble pops, however it was caused, then everyone will go down together, more or less, though no doubt some funds will do relatively better (including, perhaps, quality and value focused funds, which have struggled for so long versus tech/growth…) Fair enough, absolute nonsense is probably a bit harsh. But the idea bubbles are caused by indexing I think is a mistake. Bubbles or extreme price moves in both directions have occurred in all markets, not just stocks, since records began. Most of these markets did not have any form of indexing. On my long investing journey (am now 80) I remember my first convincing star manager Ian Rutherford of Personal Assets Trust whose investing outlook perfectly fitted my conservative investing feelings.Alas he was taken from us too soon -rather emphasising one of the problems of relying on “star” managers Various other heroes like Jim Slater shot briefly and brightly across the investing firmament -there were many of his ilk Realising that putting faith in one person was a fraught investing policy-how does a mere amateur investor pick the winners? Index investing eventually came to the rescue via Vanguard and John Bogle to my great investing relief-no educated guesswork needed I very much enjoy reading about the success of Terry Smith etc but then a Woodford comes along……… Index investing is very boring but retirement finances need to be 100% successful-so boring is OK with me Indexing has done the job for me-so far!-However I keep reading financial news-Monevator etc-but so far all it does is reinforce my current conservative investing policy but who knows down the line what might appear…….. xxd09 A very good article The Investor, which I thought was very balanced. Thank you. I have to confess that Fundsmith is the only active fund that I currently hold in my portfolio (less than 5% of it), with everything else being trackers (apart from one ‘fun’ individual company share). I have had it a long while now and, in the past, it has been good to me (186% up). I invested in it because I like Terry Smith (the UK’s Warren Buffet- we hoped) and how he talks. Although for the last five years his defence of his track record has become less and less convincing. I am curious to see what happens in the future. If in the next few years, he hugely underperforms the market does he decide that reducing the funds 1% management charge might be in order? ( I think Warren Buffet would). In fairness to him he does have integrity and is rich enough not to care about what other people think of him. A while back, buoyed by the success of Fundsmith, I invested in his FEET fund, basically Fundsmith in Emerging Markets. It was not a success (better to have bought an EM tracker). He run it for a few years before handing over to two of his team (who couldn’t improve it). He wound up FEET BUT the pay out was generous compared to the final share price (from memory I don’t think I lost any money on it apart from opportunity cost). With regard to his latest tirade against the unfairness of the all-encompassing passive trackers (I admit I haven’t actually read his words) I think he is on a sticky wicket. Passive trackers are here to stay – too bad, get over it. There is a truism in economics – You can never buck a trend! Seems to make some sense that passive flows could distort the stock market and lead to some misallocation of capital. But then, this should create opportunities that active managers can exploit, and we’re not seeing that. Active managers still underperform the market on average, and afaik the level of underperformance has been roughly the same over the past decades (and the rise of index funds). Academic economists usually work with “spherical horse in vacuum”-type assumptions. I think we’re better off relying on practical observations. Index funds it is for me, until I see active stock managers actually outperform. That said, if quality-factor stocks are so unloved at the moment, maybe it’s a good time to take a punt. @indexing #1 & #3: that’s not a claim being made under the Inelastic Markets Hypothesis (it’s a straw man point). The IMH does not postulate that passive flows ’cause’ overvaluation and/or crashes (at least per se). Rather, the IMH merely claims that, beyond a certain point, due to both increasing net passive flows and increasing passive share (dominance), public markets become increasingly less elastic, less informationally efficient (in terms of informed price discovery) and that larger caps weight stocks become progressively overweighted compared to their effective crisis liquidity (i.e. ever less effective liquidity under stress per unit of capitalisation): See Monevator here: “Why market cap investing still works”. March 4, 2025, @me #80 Here: “Passive investing, edge, and market efficiency: winners need losers”, September 19, 2024, @me #11 Here: “Weekend reading: oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms?” September 7, 2024, @ZX #16 and immediately following. Here: “Weekend reading: Fama and fortune”. August 31, 2024, @me #3 and #9 And here: “Weekend reading: We all feel the pain of active fund managers now.” February 9, 2024, @ZX #16 and @me #37 For the avoidance of doubt IMH is not an argument for active management. Index investing will clearly follow a trend and NEW money will reinforce that trend. In the present market we can underweight the stocks / region that we perceive as overvalued. At some point the markets fall, is that the correction or just a dip…. Given we feel the market has fallen, how do we respond ? A logical answer is that a tracker is the route out , we don’t know what will rise again most quickly , “if you can’t find the needle buy the haystack “ So we need to veer away from the market tracker and then head back in, timing is tough. It’s worth thinking back to 1988/89 Japanese market was very expensive and was 45% of the world index (iirc) and USA was 25% but when it crashed big time in 1989 , the world index fell but within a couple of years the index had largely recovered… Perhaps that might point to how the AI excitement might play out ? Peter Thiel, seriously? @Ian — It’s an excellent book. I don’t share the man’s politics but he understands 21st Century business! Terry Smith and Nick train get a lot of credit for their factor happening to outperform in the early days of their funds’ launch. Terry Smith’s long term track record (and short term track record for that matter) looks a lot less impressive if you pick an appropriate benchmark with a similar factor exposure (the MSCI World Quality index say, rather that the MSCI World). I would say that index funds exaggerate (and perhaps highlight?) strongly held beliefs. So the US Exceptionalism concept has a key impact on the allocation of the global trackers. Then at a lower level in the UK you do have shares at very unusually low valuations (for example, retail is generally trading both on low earnings and earnings multipliers). With others at better values. These are both beliefs about where value should or shouldn’t be, but both could be temporary. And index funds are led by the hand by these beliefs. The advantage of the active investor or an investor in industry ETFs is they can go against these preconceptions, which may work well IF they are right (this is basically Buffet, Graham etc). At its core – index funds are not God – they contain mistakes, but at its core they can be reduced to generalizations, and understood. The problem is it takes a lot of time and energy to understand the generalizations in an index, and with most market commentary being misleading at best, the question is whether it’s worth extra time of effort. That I think will forever be debated – but there will be cycles where indexes outperform, and cycles where they don’t. The smaller houses lead to happier lives article is interesting. There’s a lot to be said for living in a good community. I think i heard Naval say similar on a podcast they’ve purposely chosen to live in a smaller house in a nice community rather than a remote mansion. It’s hard deciding on size of home more space isn’t always better seem to get filled with junk. The population chart isn’t good. Without wanting to bring the b word into it if that was a vote for sovereignty then the Boris wave was a proper kick in the teeth. Now we seem to be in a situation where we have a brain drain of talent and a policy of importing less desirable (pc term) low skilled people. When are we going to see govt embrace autonomous driving and lay off importing uber drivers? Re “With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do.” I think your gut-level theory falls down on the point of equating index investing with a free lunch. Most active participants are trying to beat the market, indexers are accepting average which I don’t see as a free lunch. They’re already resigned to the fact they won’t beat the market, but are happy to settle for that, knowing they’ll have lower costs, less mental work, etc. @Scott — the free lunch here would be relying on the work of active investors to analyse and try to put the correct value on shares. “The market” is a result of that work at any moment in time (plus or minus any disputed in elasticity effects…) I suppose one could argue that the active investors are effectively squabbling over the bill themselves in terms of the Gains/losses netting out, but nevertheless there’s billions of dollars of work here index investors aren’t paying for. Of course how many billions are required to keep a market efficient is open to debate. I’d be very open to believing it’s a lot less than is still being paid today! 🙂 Enjoyed the BBC piece on willpower. There are so many mysteries in obesity which get little attention as we’re still stuck on the now discredited calories in, calories out model. It’s the only large scale public health intervention which has not only not worked but gotten worse (including other interventions which also require ‘willpower’ like smoking cessation). On The Root of All article, symbols and ritual are thought to have a role in nourishing the non-propositional machinery beneath the intellectual abstract world we consciously inhabit. There has in a way always been tracker funds and a lot of money in them. Just a different name, closet trackers, basically a tracker fund where an a manager fiddled around the edges and called it an active fund. If you went to your local bank you tended to end up in one of those. There will always be actively managed funds, hope springs eternal. I’m not surprised Terry Smith is blaming his poor performance on index trackers its a common practice by politicians etc, blame someone/something else. That way you get your customers to shift their focus away from your poor performance. I wonder how the active v passive argument will play out once the much predicted correction occurs. I suspect that global trackers stuffed to the gills with AI plays may fall more significantly than Train/Smith – making the active plays ironically but temporarily the low volatily choice. On a somewhat different note I would be really interested in Monevators opinions on Cedebergs July 2025 paper “Beyond the Status Quo A critical assessment of lifestyle investment advice”. Also any comments on Morningstar’s paper “The state of retirement income for 2026” that outlines alternatives to the fixed withdrawal rate e.g guardrails approach would be very welcome. So the Trump administration has fully escalated the battle with the Fed. Its going to be a long week Nassim Nicholas Taleb recounted the time he worked as a trader for some large bank in New York, and at the weekly team meeting, he was asked for his view on whether the market would rise or fall in the coming week. He replied that he expected the market to rise, on balance of probabilities, as it had done for many weeks. One of his colleagues “called him out” (or whatever this kind of misbehaviour was called in the 1980s), demanding to know why Taleb held a short position in the market, if he believed that it would rise in the coming week. Taleb calmly repeated his stated position that the market was likely to rise over the coming week, but if it didn’t, then it would fall a long way, and then he would profit handsomely. Many investors are asking the wrong question (“will the market rise over the next week?”), rather than looking at how to make rich returns from other people’s preference for steady return. It might be a good time to buy some call options on Iranian equities. Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

Title: Billionaire Chase Coleman Abruptly Dumps $3,490,202,000 of Meta, Buys Tech Stock That’s Soared 2x in Six Months

Full Content:
The founder of investment firm Tiger Global Management, Chase Coleman, is offloading a massive stake in Facebook’s parent company while loading up on a tech stock that has rallied massively over the past couple of months. According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Coleman dumped shares of Meta Platforms (META) worth approximately $3.49 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Since October, Meta Platforms has shed roughly 10% of its value. Over the same period, Coleman initiated a position in database software firm MongoDB (MDB) worth approximately $105.84 million. Earlier this week, MongoDB hit a 23-month high price of about $440 amid consecutive double-digit growth in revenues and profits over the past four quarters. MongoDB is trading at $414 at time of writing, up by approximately 106% from July of 2025. Another notable new position that Coleman initiated in the third quarter was a stake in streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) worth approximately $242.06 million. Besides Meta Platforms, other public companies that Coleman partially offloaded stakes in in the third quarter of 2025 include pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). In Eli Lilly, Coleman sold a stake worth approximately $1.18 billion, while offloading shares worth around $87.59 million in Novo Nordisk. Other stocks in which Coleman offloaded significant stakes include the world’s largest coatings company, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), cybsecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) and fintech firm Chime Financial (CHYM). Coleman sold shares worth $299.5 million, $254.7 million and $178.8 million, respectively, in the three public firms.
