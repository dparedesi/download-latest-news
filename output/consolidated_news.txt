Data from Bloomberg shows that of the 575 ETFs launched this year, 14 of the top 30 products have been either new Bitcoin or Ethereum funds, with the top four spots owned by Bitcoin funds. And in the past four years, of the 1,800 ETFs that started trading during that span, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust is the biggest by far in terms of inflows, the data shows. 575 ETFs have now launched in 2024... *14 of top 30* by inflows are either spot btc or eth ETFs. Includes 6 of top 10. There are also 2 MSTR-related ETFs in top 30. Crypto appetite from tradfi is real. pic.twitter.com/DmD6f5zJ1P — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) October 23, 2024 ETFs are popular investment vehicles that trade on stock exchanges. They allow investors to buy and sell shares that track the price of anything from the S&P 500 and gold to Bitcoin and real estate firms. In January, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Bitcoin products, allowing 10 such funds to start trading on American stock exchanges after a decade of denials. The investment vehicles have been widely popular, attracting billions of dollars in months in flows. Last week, they collectively crossed the $20 billion mark—smashing expectations by taking just 10 months to do what gold ETFs did over five years. The reason for the fast money, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF research analyst James Seyffart, is partly down to investors who had wanted to invest in Bitcoin for some time, but didn't have a safe or easy way before the approval of the ETFs. Now that the ETFs are trading, that demand is rapidly entering the market. “I think it was partly pent-up demand,” he told Decrypt. “But it’s also new demand as people are learning more.” He added that traditional financial institutions are interested in the products too—including hedge funds involved in futures trading. “That has helped improve flows and demand,” he said, adding that hedge funds have been going long on the ETFs and then selling the futures contracts. Massive institutions—including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs—now have exposure to Bitcoin via the new products. The price of Bitcoin even hit a new all-time high in March following their approvals. But the Ethereum counterparts haven’t had as much luck thus far. The SEC approved the ETFs for the second-biggest cryptocurrency—reluctantly, it appeared—in May. They haven’t done nearly as much in terms of inflows since trading began in July. This is partially because Grayscale’s Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) previously operated like a closed-end fund rather than an ETF before July. Its subsequent conversion means that investors who previously had cash locked up in the fund have fast been redeeming shares—leading to massive outflows. So far, $3 billion has left the fund, bringing the total flows for all nine Ethereum ETFs currently trading to negative $472.7 million, Farside data shows. However, that doesn’t mean demand won't pick up. Investors have thrown cash at the other products, and that could mean a turnaround is on the horizon. “It’s just that the outflows from ETHE are overwhelming the inflows to these other [Ethereum] ETFs,” added Seyffart. “For now.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Delta Sues Crowdstrike Over July IT Outage That Affected Thousands Of Flights

Delta Air Lines (DAL) is suing cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Inc. (CRWD) over a faulty software update in July that brought its operations to a halt and affected more than a million customers. In a lawsuit Friday, Delta said the software update that affected Microsoft (MSFT) Windows-based systems across the world was "catastrophic" for the company, leading to days of canceled or delayed flights. The airlines estimates that the debacle cost it $500 million, along with loss of future revenue and damaged reputation. The complaint alleges breach of contract, gross negligence and intentional misrepresentation or fraud by omission on CrowdStrike's part. Delta, which was among the most severely affected by the outage, took this legal action after months of finger-pointing among the three companies. Previously, both CrowdStrike and Microsoft had criticized Delta's handling of the situation, saying that the airline refused offers for help. “While we aimed to reach a business resolution that puts customers first, Delta has chosen a different path,” a CrowdStrike spokesperson told CNBC. “Delta’s claims are based on disproven misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.” CORRECTION: This article has been updated with the correct spelling of CrowdStrike in several instances, and of Delta Air Lines.

Title: Blizzard Kicks off WoW 20th and Warcraft 30th Anniversary Celebrations
URL: https://tagn.wordpress.com/2024/10/26/blizzard-kicks-off-wow-20th-and-warcraft-30th-anniversary-celebrations/

Full Content:
Hey, you want to buy a $90 Brutosaur mount? The 20th anniversary celebrations are kicking off for World of Warcraft, which is also being joined to the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise as a whole, and Blizz wants you to be able to celebrate the milestone in any number of ways, including handing them nearly a C note for a digital mount… because greed deserves representation too, doesn’t it? I mean, we’re coming up on the 15th anniversary of the Celestial Steed as well, the very first cash shop mount, the original greed steed… if we leave out that Runes of Magic mount from 2009. Blizz never met an idea they wouldn’t snatch and call their own! If Runes of Magic failed, it was probably in pricing too low. Why charge $10 when $25 is possible? Am I getting off course and editorializing too much already? That is the value add you come here for, isn’t it? Okay, let’s talk about the celebrations. WoW Turns 20 Blizz has the event broken out in their post nicely enough, so I am just going to use that. Two can play this stealing game Blizz! Here’s what you can look forward to during the WoW 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. All of which means you need to find the portal to the Caverns of Time… there is such a thing up in the old tower in Stormwind… and head on out of the cavern where you’ll find a fair laid out, with that big sword stuck in Azeroth visible in the distance. Did that show up with Battle for Azeroth? I forget. The event with the silhouette of the sword in the distance I found it a bit disorienting… but I also play WoW Classic with the old UI and so the whole new UI layout and such is different enough to require me to relearn a lot or go away. I did a couple of the intro quests and then went away. So that is the kick off of the big event. Over in WoW Classic… we have nothing on the calendar. If you’re playing 14 year old WoW you don’t get to celebrate 20 years. I was also a bit disappointed that, during my brief visit to retail, I did not see the $90 Brutorsaur mount out and about anywhere. I thought surely there would be one in the middle of the square in the grand tradition of “that guy on the mount” in Azeroth. But maybe $90 was too dear. Or maybe I just don’t go to the places where people show off those sorts of things in retail anymore. Stormwind is pretty old school at this point. A pity. It is a handsome mount, and even comes with an auctioneer and a mailbox, so you can do your business on the go. This baby will hold so many auctions If you want a better deal… for specific definitions of “better” I suppose… for just $30 they’ll sell you eight special edition mounts to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise. I guess it always comes back to commerce. Anyway, the event runs out into the new year. Lots of time to partake. The actual 20th anniversary of the game is a month out still and I suspect there will be an achievement for logging in closer to that date as well. We shall see. Well, as we know from economics class, things are worth what people are willing to pay for them. So someone out there must be that into WoW that an occasional Benjamin is reasonable. Or maybe, based on your observation, $90 is a bridge too far and we will soon see “special discounts” … LikeLike Might be that we need to know where to look, like in TWW zones or something. I read that if you convert the mount to Canadian dollars and include tax the mount is worth $150 (Canadian). That’s… Yikes. LikeLike The $90 mount people are probably standing on a mailbox in whatever location is the “new” level capped watering hole. I guess it’s for the best that Blizz got rid of the ability to /spit on people, because I’d imagine that people would be doing that a lot. As for the event, apparently it consists of a ton of FOMO-induced weekly events, so I guess getting that old “gotta do all the chores” feeling from Legion onward is what they were aiming for to bring that nostalgia. I have heard through some YouTube posts here and there that there were some really broken pieces to the Retail patch that dropped, so I guess THAT is part of the 20th anniversary experience too. But yes, the irony that there’s an “original” version of the game available in Classic Era as well as a Cataclysm Classic version of the game that neither actually have a celebration in place says a lot about what Blizz thinks of the entire Classic endeavor. Even just a short note saying “thanks” from Blizzard Entertainment –like back in the old days– would have been nice. LikeLike I saw an image online of a pack of these mounts standing on top of something to obscure it from other players… because that is always what happened. But I think it was out in the TWW zones, which I do not have access to and I wasn’t interested enough to go find them even if I did have access. LikeLike I’d have to say that compared to anniversary celebrations I’ve seen in quite a number of other games over the years, that does not look like a very impressive selection. But then, I don’t really play WoW so I don’t have the context to judge. LikeLike I can assure you there are plenty of Brutosaurs about in Dornogal (the War Within capital). While players always wail and gnash their teeth about this kind of thing, there are enough of them out there who’ll happily buy it instantly to make it worth it for Blizz. I may write my own post about the anniversary event at some point, but it’s early days. It has some fun activities, but based on how it was described I kind of expected more. And the limitations on earning the event currency definitely feel heavy-handed. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

ERIC KIM Benzinga has extensively covered recent Bitcoin trends, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s resilience and investor interest. As Bitcoin currently hovers around $68,000, analysts on Benzinga see strong underlying support and potential for further gains. They suggest that the upcoming U.S. election could be a pivotal factor, with predictions that a Trump victory might push Bitcoin to $80,000 by year-end due to expected crypto-friendly policies, while a Harris victory might lead to a short-term dip before resuming an uptrend . Additionally, Benzinga notes that October has historically been a strong month for Bitcoin, often termed “Uptober,” with the coin gaining around 8.9% so far this month. High inflows into Bitcoin ETFs also signal robust institutional interest, with companies like BlackRock leading the way, driving positive market sentiment and solidifying support at key price levels .

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Demand At 6-Month High, BTC Capped Below $70,000
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-demand-btc-below-70000/
Time Published: 2024-10-26T13:00:52Z

Bitcoin prices are steady above the $66,000 support when writing on October 25. While confidence is high, the coin is still trending below the psychological round at $70,000. It has yet to shake off sellers in early October. However, looking at emerging spot Bitcoin ETF trends, this is about to change. The latest analysis by Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant on October 25 shows that the demand for these crypto derivative products has risen over the last 30 days. The uptick has seen the demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States rise to a six-month high, attracting over 64,900 BTC in net flows. Net flows, which consider total inflows and outflows over the test period, can be used to gauge institutional interest. Whenever it rises, coupled specifically with expanding inflows, it means more institutions are getting exposure to the digital gold. The more institutional interest increases, the more likely BTC will shoot higher. Soso Value data shows that issuers in the United States collectively manage over $66 billion. On October 24, investors bought over $188 million of BTC through their issuers. So far, BlackRock, through its IBIT, is the largest issuer, controlling over $27 billion of BTC. Over the past few months, Grayscale’s GBTC has seen massive outflows. On October 24, over $7 million of BTC were redeemed from GBTC. There are high hopes that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States paved the way for institutions to drive prices. Before then, most found exposure to BTC via approved Trusts, some offered by Grayscale. Meanwhile, some institutions bought MicroStrategy stocks as their performance reflected BTC, given the public company’s heavy investment in the digital asset. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy owns over 250,000 BTC, the biggest haul of any public company in the United States and worldwide. Over the years since their strategy of regularly stacking BTC, its stock, MSTR, has outperformed top stocks and indices in the United States. Only time will tell whether BTC bulls have what it takes to break above $70,000. The round number marks September highs. If Bitcoin builds on the rejection of lower prices on October 24, it could find the momentum necessary to define the short-term trajectory. A firm close above this psychological resistance line paves the way for a retest of $72,000 and all-time highs. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

The era of double-digit growth in the stock market may be coming to an end. Goldman Sachs (GS) strategists led by David Kostin estimate that the S&P 500 index will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade — well below the 13% returns in the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%. Read More The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major indexes opened lower on Wednesday as the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note continued its upward climb, reaching 4.23%—a level not seen since July. However, there was some relief for investors as oil prices eased, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures trading around $70.65 per barrel. Read More The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a downturn, closely mirroring the decline in the stock market. On Wednesday, Bitcoin saw a significant drop of over 2.5% in the past 24 hours, with its price hovering around $65,000. This decline has dashed hopes of breaking the $70,000 threshold, which had gained traction just a week prior. The downward trajectory underscores the growing volatility in the crypto market and highlights the interconnectedness between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets. Read More It was a mixed day for investors, as the Dow dropped over 200 points and the Nasdaq jumped after Tesla’s better-than-expected earnings report.

Title: Here are the make-or-break factors for bitcoin after a blistering rally so far in 2024

It's been a momentous year for bitcoin, with big price gains to match some of the most important developments for the token in years. It started with the Securities and Exchange Commission's groundbreaking approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January. That made it easier for average investors to buy and trade the crypto, and helped mainstream the token via fund offerings from asset management titans like BlackRock and Fidelity. In April, bitcoin underwent its scheduled "halving," reducing the amount of tokens miners are rewarded by half. The event, which happens roughly every four years, is bullish as it cuts the supply of new tokens to the market. The cryptocurrency has surged 57% in 2024, and is up by over 90% in the last year. Investors and analysts are still bullish, eyeing more gains in the year to come even as election uncertainty looms. "I'm really bullish for 2025," Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told Business Insider. "There are all these positive trends." Still, other market pros told BI that there are some headwinds building that could cause the rally to stumble. Here are the make-or-break factors to watch. Hougan pointed to a broad set of monetary easing cycles from central banks as a key bullish driver for bitcoin. Central bank easing typically boosts risk assets like crypto. When interest rate volatility was high over the summer, Bitcoin slumped as investors poured into defensive areas of the market. The Federal Reserve's big rate cut last month fueled a bitcoin rally, and crypto experts say the broader central bank easing cycle that's kicking off around the world should reinforce the gains. CoinDesk Indices' Andy Baehr says that monetary easing should fuel the cryptocurrency's rise in the months ahead. "This is something the market can count on for months or quarters. The mood changed right away," Baehr said, pointing to the immediate rise in bitcoin's price as well as an increase in other indicators of strength like rising exchange volumes. Less bullish for crypto would be a more muscular regulatory approach to the market, and uncertainty about the oversight regime is a headwind. "The worst outcome for crypto is one that sustains uncertainty around the direction of crypto legislation and regulation," Hougan said, adding that the election outcomes could throw a wrench into the equation. "We have a hunch of what a Harris administration or a Trump administration would do, but we know that those promises don't always come through, and you can have harsh results," Hougan said, pointing to when crypto was excited for Gary Gensler to take over as SEC chair before proving strict on crypto regulation. Hougan said, though, that he thinks bitcoin appears to be in the clear with regulators after the SEC approved the spot ETFs. The US presidential election also remains top of mind for crypto investors. While both Trump and Harris are seen as pro-crypto, it's been Trump who has embraced the market publicly in recent months, speaking at events and even launching his own NFTs. This has led the market to believe he'd be the one to truly allow it to flourish and bitcoin has rallied as Trump's odds of winning the election have risen. A Trump win could shoot bitcoin to $125,000 by the end of the year, a jump of over 80% from Friday's prices, according to Standard Charter analyst Geoff Kendrick. But even if odds shift in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris, bitcoin will likely still rally, Hougan said. He says a Trump win would be an accelerant for crypto in the few months after the election, but bitcoin will likely do well in the long term regardless, as Harris appears to be friendlier to crypto than President Joe Biden. "Two years ago, crypto was talking about Sam Bankman Fried and the biggest financial crime of all time, and crypto was completely toxic. Today, both presidential campaigns are posturing in positive ways toward the crypto industry," Hougan said. After the election, bitcoin's path looks less clear. As markets fixate on the result of the November contest, there's no clear catalyst for further gains after that. "Sharks need to swim to survive. If they stop they will die," Hougan said, adding, "Bitcoin is sort of like that. It is, in the end, a narrative- and growth-focused entity." He says, though, that the narrative could point toward greater institutional adoption, or toward more potentially real-world applications for crypto. Among the bullish drivers, the spot ETFs that drove a rally earlier this year will likely still have a positive impact. "I think Bitcoin ETF flows will accelerate in Q4 and then accelerate again in 2025. And I don't think that's priced into the market or expected," Hougan said. Baehr said the rising prominence of bitcoin ETFs and their backing from firms like BlackRock will help the crypto push further into the mainstream. "I think that the asset class now is able to participate in more serious conversations, and so the price of bitcoin is just going to enjoy that universal expansion and that network enrichment," Baehr said.

Title: Tokenized treasuries are red-hot, but face struggles to dethrone stablecoins

Time Published: 2024-10-26T11:25:20Z

Investing.com -- Creating digital versions, or tokenizing real world assets on blockchains has been at the cutting edge of demonstrating crypto's use case. And now tokenised treasuries are enjoying their moment in the spotlight as an alternative yield to stablecoins, but these emerging digital assets face significant hurdles toward wider adoption needed to dethrone stablecoins. Tokenized treasuries -- the digital versions of Treasury bonds created on a blockchain such as Ethereum -- have racked up a market cap of nearly $2.5 billion, up from around $800M since the turn of the year, according to data from tracker RWA.xyz. "This universe of tokenized treasuries has been growing fast over the past year approaching $2.4bn. And, although much smaller than the $180bn universe of traditional stablecoins, their fast growth has the potential to challenge stablecoin's dominance in the future," analysts at JPMorgan said in a recent note. The need for yield-bearing alternatives to major stablecoins such as Tether and USDC/USD, which typically don't offer interest or share reserve yields, has been driving demand for tokenized treasuries. It makes good regulatory sense for stablecoins to avoid offering interest to its users as doing so would attract further regulatory restrictions, requiring compliance with securities law, JPMorgan said, "thus hindering their current seamless and permissionless use as source of collateral in the crypto ecosystem." Stablecoin users, however, aren't sitting idle willing to stomach the opportunity cost of holding yield-bearing assets. They have been employing various strategies to earn yield on their stablecoins. But these strategies such as secured lending, unsecured lending, basis trade "involve risk and ceding control and custody of their balances," the analysts said. With U.S. Treasury yields still at multi-year highs, and now expected to remain higher for longer as U.S. economic exceptionalism continues, tokenized government debt appears to be scratching the 'need for yield' itch and could potentially continue to pry away dollars from stablecoins. Tokenized treasuries offer several advantages over traditional stablecoins. They provide yield to users without the need for risky trading or lending strategies, not require users to cede control or custody of their assets. The market for tokenized treasuries has also been spurred by institutional investors launching tokenized funds, allowing investors access to on-chain offerings with 24/7 liquidity. Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL, earlier this year on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing investors to redeem their shares or BUIDL tokens for USDC stablecoin through a smart contract at any time, without the need for an intermediary. Some tokenized funds including Blackrock's BUIDL, which has amassed a market cap of nearly $0.6 million since its launch in April, are also looking to steal stablecoins' lunch in a key market: the crypto derivatives market. Stablecoins tend to be used as collateral in crypto derivatives trades, with Tether Holdings’s stablecoin USDT and Circle Internet Financial's USDC among the most widely used tokens for derivatives collateral on exchanges, with market caps of $120B and $34B, respectively. But this very advantage, the offering of yield, that tokenized treasuries are able to dangle in front of investors poses a major headwind in their quest to steal sizable portion stablecoins' lunch. "Tokenized treasuries fall under securities law which restrict offerings to accredited investors, thus inhibiting broader market adoption," the analysts said. BlackRock's BUIDL, for example, has high entry barriers with a minimum investment of $5 million and restriction on offering these products to accredited investors. Blackrock's big push to persuade cryptocurrency exchanges to more widely use its digital token shows there is potential to partly replace traditional stablecoins as collateral in crypto derivative trading, but the liquidity or the lack thereof (relative to that of stablecoins), suggest these new kids on the crypto derivatives market block aren't likely to dominate any time soon. This regulatory hurdle suggests that stablecoins -- boasting a market cap nearing $180B across multiple blockchains and centralized exchanges, ensuring traders receive low transaction costs even for large transactions -- aren't at risk of losing the significant advantage they hold over tokenized treasuries in terms of liquidity, JPMorgan said. This deep liquidity, which is key to seamless trading, implies that tokenized treasuries, with a market cap of around $2.4B, would "eventually replace only a fraction of the stablecoin universe," JPMorgan said. While the bar to knock stablecoins off their perch is likely to remain high, tokenized Treasuries are expected to continue to grow by potentially replacing "non-yield-bearing stablecoins in DAO treasuries, liquidity pools, and idle cash with crypto venture funds."

Title: Is Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA) the Best Airline Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Airline Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA) stands against the other airline stocks. We also dive deep into trends in the commercial aviation industry, especially the impact the return of international travel to pre-pandemic levels has had on the airline industry. The coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc across the global airline industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), industry revenues slumped from $838 billion in 2019 to $384 billion a year later, registering a 54.1% downfall. However, the market has gradually recovered over the last few years and is on track for solid growth as international travel resumes worldwide. READ ALSO: 10 Best Airline Stocks To Buy According To Short Sellers and 10 Worst Airline Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. A report by UN Tourism in January this year stated that international tourism was recorded in 2023 at 88% of pre-pandemic levels, and is on track to return to levels before the coronavirus struck. The IATA anticipates global airline revenue to reach $996 billion in 2024, 19% higher than in 2019 and 1.5 times higher than the pandemic low of 2020. The global travel recovery has been led by the Middle East, the strongest tourism market in 2023, as it welcomed 22% more travelers than it did in 2019, becoming the only region to prevail over pandemic levels. Europe reached 94% of the levels in 2019, while Africa stood at 96%. Asia Pacific has been rather slow, recovering only 65% of pre-pandemic levels as of last year. The uptick in international travel is yielding solid returns this year. As of October 23, 2024, a major airline ETF issued by U.S. Global Investors has grown by 18.44% YTD, outperforming the broader market by 4.5%. Analysts at Forbes believe airline stocks are poised for strong growth during the second half of 2024 as fuel prices dip after long periods of price hikes. Fuel accounts for between 20-30% of airlines’ total costs. Moreover, airlines in the US are cutting down on excess domestic capacity after compressed margins during the summer season. The oversupply of seats has resulted in lower fares, and airline operators are determined to correct that. The deceleration of capacity, coupled with strong travel demand, will enhance their pricing power and improve earnings. Hedge fund sentiment on airline stocks is also encouraging. Tony Bancroft from Gabelli Funds shared his insights on commercial aviation at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago on June 26. He noted a significant growth in aircraft orders, resulting in major aircraft manufacturers having a 12-year backlog of orders. Bancroft cited China as the primary catalyst driving robust demand. According to the portfolio manager, the country represented 20% of all new aircraft orders as Chinese airlines strive to cater to the growing demand for travel among the middle class at home and in neighboring India. Bancroft also highlighted the rising middle class in the United States and other parts of the world that are increasing international travel, and contributing to the strength of the commercial aviation industry. We sampled stocks from ETFs with airline exposure and then picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Boeing 737-Next Generation aircraft in flight, highlighting the efficiency of the company's fleet. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24 Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA) is a publicly traded airline passenger and cargo service company. It owns two airlines: Copa Airlines, which provides international air transportation through its hub in Panama City, and Copa Airlines Colombia, which operates domestic and international flights from various cities in Colombia. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2 2024, 24 hedge funds held stakes in the company, making it one of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Renaissance Technologies is the biggest investor in the company, among those tracked by Insider Monkey, with its holding valued at $82.99 million as of June 30, 2024. The company reported robust results during the second quarter of 2024, earning a net profit of $120.3 million, with EPS logged at $2.88. Its operating margin stood at 19.5%, making it the second-best quarter in the airline’s history. The strong performance was driven by a 10.6% increase in passenger traffic from the same period last year. Capacity increased by 9.7% during the quarter, resulting in a 0.7% increase in load factor, which now stands at 86.8%. Another metric that paints a promising picture of the company is the 5.8% year-over-year decline in cost per average seat mile, driven by lower sales and distribution charges and reduced aircraft maintenance costs. Low sales and distribution costs were attributed to most passengers directly booking their flights from Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA), instead of third-party channels. Customers also increasingly utilize the low-cost NDC travel agency channel. Looking ahead, the airline is aiming to ramp up its capacity between September and December to reach full capacity by the end of the year. It has also reaffirmed its operating margin for the full year 2024 to be in the range of 21% to 23%. This has led to a bullish sentiment around the stock. Wall Street analysts have consensus on the stock’s Strong Buy rating and anticipate a near 49% upside potential, on average, in its share price. The company does face a challenge emanating from the suspension of flight operations to Venezuela which is likely to affect its capacity and unit revenue guidance. However, the overall outlook for the company remains positive. Overall CPA ranks 6th on our list of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of CPA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CPA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:LUV) is a major airline based in the United States, that offers flights from 117 airports across 11 countries. The low-cost carrier operates on a point-to-point model enabling direct flights between destinations, and eliminating the time and distance taken when traveling with airlines that require passengers to travel through a conventional hub. During the second quarter of 2024, Southwest Airlines generated a revenue of $7.35 billion, beating expectations of $7.32 billion, and up 4.5% from last year. Net income for Q2 stood at $367 million, resulting in an EPS of 58 cents, which beat estimates, but was down 46% year-over-year. The company’s earnings continue to be burdened, partly driven by plane delivery delays from Boeing, which has depressed revenues and increased pressures on costs. The airline has also been greatly affected by dampened airfares amid overcapacity in the domestic market. According to a September report in the Associated Press, the company’s shares have lost around half of their value over the past three years due to these factors, which has led to increased investor pressure to improve performance. Elliott Investment Management, a hedge fund, has launched a campaign to call a special meeting of shareholders to dump CEO Bob Jordan and replace two-thirds of the board of directors for underperformance. The airline has recently announced plans to end its open-seating policy and begin offering premium seating, in a bid to elevate customer experience and drive shareholder value. Southwest Airlines expects revenue from its new seat model and extra legspace to be north of what it generates from its ancillary offerings. The company will also be starting red-eye flights in early 2025. Southwest has also been improving its operational systems, which helped the company stay largely unaffected by the global tech outage in July. While hedge fund sentiment towards the company has dipped significantly – from 33 hedge funds having investments in the stock in Q1 to just 23 in Q2 – because of the ongoing headwinds, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) continues to be one of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Overall LUV ranks 7th on our list of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of LUV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Chart of the Week: Taking a closer look at the Magnificent Seven

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Tesla (TSLA) stole the show this week, notching its biggest day in over a decade on Thursday as investors applauded the company’s quarterly results with a flurry of buying. A 22% increase that day put the stock firmly back in the green for the year, up nearly 7% now after having lagged its “Magnificent Seven” counterparts — and at one point in April being down almost 43% since the new year began. That means that for the first time since September, all seven Magnificents are back in the green, as our Chart of the Week shows. And if there’s one chart that encompasses 2024’s story for the stock market, this continues to be a good candidate. The more you look at it, the more thoughts jump out. For example, amid the euphoria of the Tesla comeback story, its 2024 arc still skews tragic — significantly lagging its peers as a distant backmarker despite the week’s gains. Zooming out further, the differences among Big Tech stocks continue to be stark, keeping questions bubbling up about Tesla’s membership in this informal — but important — cohort amid potential replacement candidates, like former FAANG member Netflix (NFLX), up 63% so far this year. Perhaps the most important line on this chart is the benchmark — who’s above it and who’s not. As Nvidia's (NVDA) outsized returns have broken further away from the rest of Big Tech, only two others have even managed to outperform the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into other sectors. Nvidia, of course, is responsible for a lot of that. When Nvidia moves, the S&P 500 usually moves too. But between Meta's (META) line and the S&P's 23% benchmark are around 150 companies — 30% of the index — that are pulling the index up as they benefit from the market’s broadening and rotation. Since the future trajectory of stocks, smoothed out, is likely to continue to go up and to the right, a narrative to watch for 2025 is exactly where the S&P 500 line will fall on this chart and which companies can outperform it. As DataTrek’s Nicolas Colas wrote this week, this is where the rubber meets the road for the economy and the Magnificent Seven. “If one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet,” Colas wrote. “Our own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech.” Ethan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

Title: Will Microsoft Shareholders Vote ‘Yes’ On Bitcoin? What To Expect

Time Published: 2024-10-26T01:00:47Z

In a recent SEC filing dated Thursday, October 24, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) revealed that an “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin” will be a voting item at its forthcoming shareholder meeting on December 10. This development has ignited discussions within the investment community about the potential direction of Microsoft’s treasury strategy and the likelihood of shareholder approval. Microsoft’s board of directors has formally recommended voting against the Bitcoin investment proposal. In supplementary materials filed with the SEC on October 25, the board articulated that the requested assessment is redundant, emphasizing that Microsoft’s management already integrates considerations of cryptocurrencies into their broader investment strategy. The board highlights that “This proposal requests that the Board conduct an assessment that is unnecessary because Microsoft’s management already carefully considers this topic. Microsoft’s Global Treasury and Investment Services team evaluates a wide range of investable assets to fund Microsoft’s ongoing operations, including assets expected to provide diversification and inflation protection.” The filing further noted that past evaluations have included Bitcoin among other cryptocurrencies. “Past evaluations have included Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among the options considered, and Microsoft continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making,” the filing adds. The board asserted confidence in Microsoft’s existing processes to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders, deeming the public assessment unnecessary. “Microsoft has strong and appropriate processes in place to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders and this requested public assessment is unwarranted.” Microsoft’s shareholder base is a diverse mix of institutional investors, public companies, and individual investors. As of June 30, 2024, institutional investors held approximately 43.13% of Microsoft’s outstanding shares, while public companies and individual investors accounted for 56.84%. Insiders held a negligible 0.04% of the shares. The Vanguard Group stands as Microsoft’s largest shareholder, owning around 9.09% of the total shares outstanding. BlackRock follows with a 7.45% stake, making it the second-largest shareholder. State Street holds the third-largest position with a 4.04% ownership. Given this distribution, these major shareholders could be pivotal in determining the outcome of the proposal. Vanguard’s anti-BTC stance suggests a likely “no” vote, aligning with the board’s recommendation. Conversely, BlackRock has become a strong proponent of Bitcoin and offers its US clients a spot Bitcoin ETF since January this year. In their latest earning call, CEO Larry Fink said, “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.” He added, “It is an alternative to other commodities like gold.” State Street seems somewhat open-minded to Bitcoin. In mid-September, State Street launched in collaboration Galaxy 3 new crypto ETFs. In August, State Street partnered with Taurus to enhance its crypto services, facilitating the transformation of real-world assets into tradable digital assets. Nonetheless, industry analysts largely predict that the proposal to invest in Bitcoin will not gain sufficient support among Microsoft shareholders. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, summarized the situation on X: “Microsoft Shareholders to Vote on Proposal to Invest in Bitcoin. MSFT Board Advises ‘Nay’. No-Coiner Vanguard owns ~9%.” Similarly, Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store and Co-Founder of the ETF Institute, expressed his expectations: “Gonna go out on a limb & predict Microsoft’s largest shareholder (Vanguard) will be voting ‘no’ on adding btc to the balance sheet…” Di Lewis, CFO at BTC Inc., also expressed strong skepticism about Microsoft’s likelihood to adopt Bitcoin, stating there is “0% chance Microsoft adds bitcoin to their balance sheet this decade.” Adam Cochran, a partner at CEHV, dismissed the proposal as a “fringe” idea from a think tank shareholder. He stated, “No. This is a fringe proposal by a think tank shareholder, and is not a serious consideration by Microsoft at large.” At press time, BTC traded at $67,608.

Title: Bitcoin Could Bring Microsoft ‘Next Trillion Dollars’ in Value, Michael Saylor Suggests
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/bitcoin-could-bring-microsoft-next-trillion-dollars-in-value-michael-saylor-suggests/

Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and executive chairman, has told Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella that he could help the company make “the next trillion dollars for MSFT shareholders.” In a post on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Saylor tagged Nadella and added along an image with a recent proposal for Microsoft shareholders to weigh in on adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet. While the proposal, put forth by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has garnered attention, Microsoft’s board of directors has recommended voting against it. The company’s board argues that it has already evaluated many investment opportunities, including Bitcoin. The NCPPR’s rationale for the proposal centers on the success of Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment strategy, which saw it outperform Microsoft by over 300% this year on the market even as it conducted a “fraction of the business” of the tech giant. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj The proposal points out that Microsoft has $484 billion in total assets “the plurality of which are US government securities and corporate bonds that barely outpace inflation,” and argues that corporations have a “fiduciary duty” to consider “diversifying their balance sheets with assets that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term.” It points out that Bitcoin’s price has been rising significantly and that MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, managed to see its shares outperform those of Microsoft this year by more than 300%, despite “doing only a fraction of the business that Microsoft has.” The NCPPR’s proposal also points out that Microsoft’s second-largest shareholder BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – offers its clients a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that can be used to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. Per the independent think tank, BTC’s volatility means companies “should not hold too much of it,” but given its track record as a hedge against inflation companies should “also not risk shareholder value by ignoring Bitcoin altogether” and recommends a minimum allocation of 1% of the company’s assets to Bitcoin.

Title: Walmart maintains the upper hand as it battles Target for Americans' wallets

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In the battle for America's shoppers, Walmart (WMT) is still dominating Target (TGT). The world's biggest retailer continues to gain high-income shoppers in the face of sticky inflation while it expands its membership and advertising revenue. It's maintained its edge in value, offering grocery prices that are about 10% to 12% cheaper for an average basket of food, per Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane. "The Walmart thesis is they're really among the biggest and best retailers out there," Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman told Yahoo Finance over the phone. The company is "well positioned when times are tough, they're well positioned when things are getting better." Walmart has done "a very good job going after a more affluent consumer and keep retaining their core customer" of lower- to middle-income consumers, Feldman added. Groceries make up 60% of US sales for Walmart but just 20% to 25% of Target's sales, per Morningstar analyst Noah Rohr. Go inside the fascinating leadership journey of Target CEO Brian Cornell Target has been trying to turn the tide, announcing a plan in May to cut prices on 5,000 goods, which Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes said "brought a positive momentum to foot traffic for Target." This week, Target announced another price cut on 2,000 items ahead of the holiday. "We believe that additional pricing cuts could spur additional traffic as we enter the crucial Holiday shopping season. Overall, we view this announcement as positive for Target's top-line and comparable sales ahead," Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe wrote in a note to clients. Walmart isn't just competing with Target, but also supermarket chains, drug stores, and discount stores. In the latest quarter, its US same-store sales were up 4.3%, while Target's declined 2.0%. Investors have awarded the results. Walmart's stock is up 52% in 2024, compared to Target's 5% gain and the S&P 500's 23% gain. Walmart's edge in the food aisles continues to help counter soft sales in categories like toys, apparel, and electronics. "Discretionary has been down for the last 10 quarters," McShane said, with some signs of recovery at both retailers. In 2025, discretionary goods spending is expected to grow, which could be a boost for Target, said McShane. When it comes to branching into other high-margin businesses, like memberships, e-commerce, and retail advertising, Walmart also took a head start. The company launched its Amazon (AMZN) Prime competitor, Walmart+, in 2020 for $98 per year. Target only started its Target Circle 360 program this March for $99 a year. Both include same-day delivery, though Target has a $35 minimum. Walmart+ touts additional perks, like savings on Paramount+ subscriptions, 25% off Burger King digital orders, $0.10 off a gallon of gas at over 13,000 stations, pickup for returns at customers' homes, and even free tire repair. "What really happened with Target Circle is they didn't do a lot with Target Circle during the COVID years where they were over-performing everybody," Ohmes said. "They really had to get beyond COVID ... beyond the inventory issues they had in 2022, and that led to the clearance issues they had in 2023." Now Target is trying to invest more aggressively in its loyalty rewards and paid memberships. It's offering Circle members an extra 30 days for returns, plus same-day orders from dozens of retailers through the Shipt Marketplace. Last quarter, Walmart US saw its e-commerce sales jump 3%, boosted by store pickups and delivery. "Pickup is growing faster than our in-store or club sales, and delivery is growing even faster than pickup. Delivery accuracy and speed continue to improve," CEO Doug McMillon said on the earnings call. Target saw its digital sales jump 8.7% year over year. CEO Brian Cornell said its Drive Up and Target Circle 360 programs both grew sales in the low teens. He added that same-day services now make up two-thirds of its digital sales, with most customers opting for Drive Up, which brought in $2 billion in sales in Q2. Walmart Connect, the company's advertising business, has also been blooming. Its US revenue grew 30% year over year, with advertising sales by online marketplace sellers up nearly 50%. Target is trying to develop its own offering, Target Roundel. Cornell said it "continues to experience rapid growth based on the joint value it creates for both our guests and our vendors," with double-digit revenue growth. It's expected to grow in the "high teens" for the full fiscal year, after "more than 20% growth in 2023." Neither retailer has shared exact revenue figures for its ads business. For reference, Amazon's ad unit boasted a 20% revenue growth year over year last quarter, bringing $12.77 billion in Q2. Walmart's e-commerce marketplace is "getting very close to being profitable" at Walmart, said McShane. "There's more buy-in from the investor base [in] the alternative revenue streams that Walmart's been going after... that they are faster-growing and higher-margin businesses that should drive better profitability for the company longer term," McShane said. "Walmart's had a great year and they've been outperforming ... From a fundamental standpoint, all is going so well for them from a stock perspective. Plus, it doesn't look like we're done ... With the setup for this holiday season, everybody's searching for value. What better retailer gives value than Walmart?" Feldman said. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: FAIR: LA Times Non-Endorsement Another Sign of Our Billionaire-Dominated Politics
URL: https://fair.org/home/la-times-non-endorsement-another-sign-of-our-billionaire-dominated-politics/
Time Published: 2024-10-25T22:22:52Z

FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING Challenging media bias since 1986. FAIR FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. The Los Angeles Times will not be making a presidential endorsement in this election, the first time the paper has stayed silent on a presidential race since 2004. But the decision not to endorse a candidate was not made by an editor. The paper’s billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, stepped in to forbid the paper from doing so. The move sparked a furor over the lack of editorial freedom (Semafor, 10/22/24; KTLA, 10/22/24; Adweek, 10/23/24). The paper lost 2,000 subscribers, and editorials editor Mariel Garza resigned in protest, along with two other staffers, including a Pulitzer Prize winner (Guardian, 10/25/24). Guardian (9/23/16): “The lack of transparency around Soon-Shiong’s reasons for not allowing his paper to make a presidential endorsement has left journalists in the Los Angeles Times’ newsroom frustrated and confused.” The LA Times was widely expected to support the Democrat, Vice President Kamala Harris, a Southern California resident and former senator from the state. The paper’s editorial board enthusiastically supported Joe Biden in 2020 (9/10/20) and Hillary Clinton four years before that (9/23/16). According to news reports, the paper had been preparing an endorsement until Soon-Shiong reached across the wall that is supposed to separate the business and editorial wings of a newspaper. He tried to rationalize his decision, according to the Guardian: “I think my fear is, if we chose either one, that it would just add to the division,” Soon-Shiong told Spectrum News, noting he was a “registered independent.” On Wednesday, Soon-Shiong tweeted that he had asked the editorial board to instead publish a list of positive and negative attributes about both of the presidential candidates, but that the board had refused. Soon-Shiong said that the dangers of divisiveness in American politics was highlighted by the responses to his tweet about his decision not to endorse, saying the feed had “gone a little crazy when we just said, ‘You decide.’” And the LA Times is not alone. The Jeff Bezos–owned Washington Post will also issue no presidential endorsement, for the first time since 1980 (NPR, 10/25/24). Former editor-in-chief Martin Baron called the move “cowardice,” telling NPR: Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate the Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage. Stat (11/21/16): “Soon-Shiong called it an ‘incredible honor’ to dine with Trump, who ‘truly wants to advance health care for all.’” Soon-Shiong, who bought the LA Times from Tronc in 2018, attempted to portray himself as a defender of the free press against attacks from then-President Donald Trump (CNBC, 9/7/18). But Soon-Shiong—a doctor who made a fortune in the for-profit medical industry (New Yorker, 10/25/21)—was not shy about his ambitions for a top health position in the Trump administration (Stat, 11/21/16, 1/25/17). Is Soon-Shiong trying to make nice with Trump? One thing we know about him is that he’s not big on paying taxes; “He hasn’t paid federal income tax in five consecutive recent years,” ProPublica (12/8/21) reported. He’s also not overly concerned about ethical niceties; Stat (7/20/17) has raised questions about conflicts of interest in his medical business and how they might impact patients. A Politico investigation (4/9/17) of Soon-Shiong’s research foundation found widespread self-dealing: Of the nearly $59.6 million in foundation expenditures between its founding in 2010 and 2015, the most recent year for which records are available, over 70% have gone to Soon-Shiong–affiliated not-for-profits and for-profits, along with entities that do business with his for-profit firms. This isn’t the first time Soon-Shiong’s intervention at the paper has raised alarms about editorial freedom. The Daily Beast (10/22/24) reported that earlier this year “executive editor Kevin Merida resigned after Soon-Shiong tried to block a story that accused one of his friends’ dogs of biting a woman in a Los Angeles park.” Layoffs at the Times earlier this year also sparked outrage from trade unionists and journalists. “A delegation of 10 members of Congress warned Soon-Shiong in a letter that sweeping media layoffs could undermine democracy in a high-stakes election year,” reported Los Angeles Magazine (1/23/24). There was also a racial element, the Times union said in a statement (Editor and Publisher, 1/24/24): It also means the company has reneged on its promises to diversify its ranks since young journalists of color have been disproportionately affected. The Black, AAPI and Latino Caucuses have suffered devastating losses. Bezos is far better known than Soon-Shiong; while it’s not reported that he directly intervened to stop a Post endorsement, like at the LA Times, NPR noted that Bezos depends on harmonious interactions with the federal government, as the company he founded, Amazon, depends on government contracts. Conflict-of-interest questions have long surrounded his control of the paper (FAIR.org, 3/1/14, 3/14/18, 9/19/19; CJR, 9/27/22; Guardian, 6/12/24; CNN, 6/18/24). NPR (10/25/24): Elon Musk “has become one of the leading boosters of baseless claims that Democrats are bringing in immigrants to illegally vote for them — a conspiracy theory that Trump and other Republicans have made core to their narratives about the 2024 election.” It’s hard to ignore that in blocking endorsements expected to go to Trump’s opponent, billionaire owners are using their media power to help a fellow billionaire. With the Washington Post, readers can easily assume that Bezos cares more about not offending the powerful than its now-laughable slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Bill Grueskin (X, 10/25/24), a professor at Columbia Journalism School, said that these endorsements are “unimportant politically” because “few votes would be swayed”—the Los Angeles area and the Beltway are solidly blue. But there’s an ominous factor here, he said, because “the billionaire owners are (intentionally or not) sending a signal to the newsrooms: Prepare to accommodate your coverage to a Trump regime.” Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, is likewise using his wealth and his ownership of the social media network Twitter (rebranded as X) to boost Trump (PBS, 10/21/24; NPR, 10/25/24). And Republican megadonor and billionaire Miriam Adelson “shelled out $95 million to the pro-Donald Trump Preserve America PAC during its third quarter,” Forbes (10/15/24) reported. Her late husband bought the Las Vegas Review-Journal in December of 2015 (AP, 12/17/15), and as the New York Times (1/2/16) reported: Suspicions about his motives for paying a lavish $140 million for the newspaper last month are based on his reputation in Las Vegas as a figure comfortable with using his money in support of his numerous business and political concerns, said more than a dozen of the current and former Review-Journal staffers and local civic figures who have worked closely with him. Big money has played an enormous part in US elections, especially since the Citizens United decision eviscerated limits on campaign spending (PBS, 2/1/23). “A handful of powerful megadonors have played an outsized role in shaping the 2024 presidential race through mammoth donations toward their favored candidates,” Axios (10/23/24) reported. These megadonors “skew Republican,” the Washington Post (10/16/24) reported. Much of the press in the United States has, correctly, portrayed a second Trump term as a threat to democracy and a move toward corrupt autocracy, eroding institutions like the free press and independent justice system (Atlantic, 8/2/23; New York Times, 9/21/24, 10/3/24, 10/22/24; MSNBC, 10/22/24; NPR, 10/22/24). Yet the intervention of Soon-Shiong and his fellow moguls is an indication that our media are already not in democratic hands. Far from it; they are in the hands of the billionaire class.

Doug Latimer October 25, 2024 at 7:17 pm The right thing to do For the so very many wrong reasons QadK October 25, 2024 at 9:58 pm Aren’t you presuming to know the motives of the LA Times owner? I do agree with you that it was probably not a bad decision, but this whole critique seems to be an indictment based more on who the owner is than the merits of his decision. Both parties are deaf to the policies favored overwhelmingly by the public, and favoring one over the other seems to be foolish in that regard. Add to that the almost lockstep unity in the media in its dismissal of Trump as a legitimate representative of a large swath of the electorate, and an endorsement for Kamala Harris who has been a lackluster candidate would serve as confirmation of that. I don’t know enough about the LA Times owner to condemn him for it wanting to appear as biased as most of the mainstream media. Gary October 25, 2024 at 11:00 pm LA is is not important. The major media {TVs) outlets, including social media and MTVs are Jewish-controlled and are endorsing the live-streamed murderous Genocide in Palestine. Alissa Reed October 26, 2024 at 7:28 pm And here we have Gary, just another hate spewing antisemite going on record with the well worn Jewish controlled media conspiracy. Next please. WalterZ October 26, 2024 at 9:01 am News outlets should not be in the business of endorsing candidates. As for Harris, she is part of an administration that has the power to stop the genocide in Gaza and to engage in de-escalation and diplomacy. Harris has indicated she will do neither of those things if elected. Why endorse such a person? TB October 26, 2024 at 10:01 am This is about taxes pure and simple. Harris has said she will make the ultra wealthy pay their fair share. Well, they don’t want to, so they go against everything they say they believe in because of their own greed. Anaisha Chopra October 26, 2024 at 12:42 pm Yea right. Is that why Mark Cuban, who is her top billionaire marquee supporter, has public stated ‘zero chance’ of asset based ‘fair’ taxes? Do you forget she was appointed by the powers that be in the Democrat party? Worse yet, she is an empty suit who stands for nothing and has no convictions. At the end of the day, she is simply the lessor of two evils. Pathetic we have to chose from these two trolls. Alissa Reed October 26, 2024 at 7:15 pm Humm…a newspaper that has never endorsed a Republican presidential candidate in it’s entire history announces it will not endorse Harris or Trump for president. They did endorse Jimmy Carter and Mondale way back when yet won’t be backing Harris. Perhaps they learned a lesson, can read leaves and don’t want to be on the losing side. Félix Matos MD October 26, 2024 at 10:10 pm By in large, today’s media is indeed in the hands of the billionaire class. The business model changed and the legacy media sorta missed the boat, with these billionaires picking up the pieces for penny’s on the dollar. That said, you gotta give Elon Musk his due. Not only was he a visionary regarding Tesla but also a genus relative to unrelated businesses like SpaceX. I admire him actually. Ryan Mills October 27, 2024 at 12:11 pm I gotta say, Musk’s SpaceX company catching that huge Starship booster rocket shortly after liftoff was a major achievement. It was also a shot across the bow for all these bloated, corrupt defense and space competitors in the US. Developing reusable boosters for its Falcon vehicles has been key to SpaceX’s efforts to cut the cost of space flight. From a small start up to this is amazing for sure and you got to give Musk his due. Bradley Grower October 26, 2024 at 10:54 pm Why this is pretty funny. Does anyone (including the above author) really think ANYONE makes up their mind on who to vote for by what a given newspaper or any media source is telling me who to vote for ? I don’t trust a given newspaper; I don’t trust anybody. Dave E October 27, 2024 at 8:25 am Mainstream media has been stepped on by their corporate owners for decades. That’s why top-flight mainstream, investigative journalist, Robert Parry, who broke the Iran Contra story left mainstream journalism to form Consortium News (which just went down today, hopefully, just a temporary server problem and not censorship). But there are many good reasons in this case not to endorse either of these two mainstream candidates, foremost being that the Biden-Harris Administration vetoed the UN call for an arms embargo to stop a genocide. Candidate Harris has assured that she will not support an arms embargo, a position that places her to the right of Ronald Reagan. Senator Kamala Harris in 2017 supported Trump’s ditching of Obama’s Iran Nuclear deal. Really, as much as I think billionaire shouldn’t exist (no, they shouldn’t all be poisoned! The system shouldn’t allow such wealth disparity!), the idea of listing the pros and cons of both is a better idea than endorsing either. However, the best idea would be to look outside the top-two (worst two) parties for one to endorse. Jill Stein and Butch Ware are far more in tune with the populace than either major party which both represent their megadonors rather than their constituents.

Title: Small Business Owners are branded “terrorists” by Federal Government

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/25/2024 3:20:20 PM PDT by george76 In just over 2 months every small business owner in America is required to be registered with the Federal Government’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The Biden/Harris administration rolled out this unconstitutional law, known as the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), on January 1st, 2024. The CTA requires all small business owners in the United States, with revenue under 5 million and less than 20 full time employees to self-report to FinCEN, housed under the Department of Treasury. According FinCEN’s website: “FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “ Your failure to report into this terrorism and intelligence database by January 1st, 2025 means that you will be subjected to fines of $591 per day and you could face a penalty of up to 2 years in federal prison. Small business owners in the United States could be jailed for up to 2 years for committing no crime, other than failing to turn over their personal, protected data to Big Brother. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

And he is a populist--the people's man--and the Deep State/Democrats/Elites hate the people.This is at the heart of this revolution. The Deep State--the government--believes it should be in charge. They don't believe the people are smart enough to have a say in the way the country is run. And the Democrats support the government.Eisenhower almost got it right...but he forgot about the permanent government when he warned us about the military/industrial complex.This is a revolution to destroy our representative government. And that will take the destruction of the Constitution.This is why the Democrats and the Deep State believe Trump and MAGA are an existential threat to their power.And they are right.If our country is to survive, Trump must win and the Democrats and the Deep State must be destroyed.There cannot be a compromise because our enemy will not accept a compromise.This is what Trump means when he speaks of our enemy within.

According FinCEN’s website: “FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “ Your failure to report into this terrorism and intelligence database by January 1st, 2025 means that you will be subjected to fines of $591 per day and you could face a penalty of up to 2 years in federal prison. Small business owners in the United States could be jailed for up to 2 years for committing no crime, other than failing to turn over their personal, protected data to Big Brother. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

Small businesses are owned and managed by "the people."This is why they hate Trump. He is not part of the system. Though he is wealthy, he is independent and the Deep State couldn't control him. And he is a populist--the people's man--and the Deep State/Democrats/Elites hate the people.This is at the heart of this revolution. The Deep State--the government--believes it should be in charge. They don't believe the people are smart enough to have a say in the way the country is run. And the Democrats support the government.Eisenhower almost got it right...but he forgot about the permanent government when he warned us about the military/industrial complex.This is a revolution to destroy our representative government. And that will take the destruction of the Constitution.This is why the Democrats and the Deep State believe Trump and MAGA are an existential threat to their power.And they are right.If our country is to survive, Trump must win and the Democrats and the Deep State must be destroyed.There cannot be a compromise because our enemy will not accept a compromise.This is what Trump means when he speaks of our enemy within.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “ Your failure to report into this terrorism and intelligence database by January 1st, 2025 means that you will be subjected to fines of $591 per day and you could face a penalty of up to 2 years in federal prison. Small business owners in the United States could be jailed for up to 2 years for committing no crime, other than failing to turn over their personal, protected data to Big Brother. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States.

Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Small businesses are owned and managed by "the people."This is why they hate Trump. He is not part of the system. Though he is wealthy, he is independent and the Deep State couldn't control him. And he is a populist--the people's man--and the Deep State/Democrats/Elites hate the people.This is at the heart of this revolution. The Deep State--the government--believes it should be in charge. They don't believe the people are smart enough to have a say in the way the country is run. And the Democrats support the government.Eisenhower almost got it right...but he forgot about the permanent government when he warned us about the military/industrial complex.This is a revolution to destroy our representative government. And that will take the destruction of the Constitution.This is why the Democrats and the Deep State believe Trump and MAGA are an existential threat to their power.And they are right.If our country is to survive, Trump must win and the Democrats and the Deep State must be destroyed.There cannot be a compromise because our enemy will not accept a compromise.This is what Trump means when he speaks of our enemy within.

All materials posted herein are protected by copyright law and the exemption for fair use of copyrighted works. Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

All materials posted herein are protected by copyright law and the exemption for fair use of copyrighted works. Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America?

The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know.

A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern.

Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing.

The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

Even when I worked for other companies, the majority of those didn’t have 20 full time employees. Don’t think they grossed $5 million, either.

No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach.

According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) stands against other best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. The modern digital world is built with its transistor-based chips on the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, the physics governing the world at the fundamental level. However, the world has barely scratched the surface when it comes to the full potential of Quantum Mechanics, that is, until Quantum computing came to the foray. In the same spirit but in different light to its classical counterpart, quantum-computing technology seeks to exploit particle superpositions for computing operations. It differs from classical computing due to the particle superpositions that occur at the quantum scale, allowing a qubit to be in a state of both 0 and 1 until it interacts with the environment. This exploit would allow Quantum computers to outperform classical computers exponentially in certain computing tasks. This could have huge implications for healthcare, finance, telecom, and energy industries, among others, ushering the world in a new era of accelerated economic growth. Mckinsey estimates that an economic value of $0.9 – $2 trillion can be extracted by 2035 across four industries – chemicals, life sciences, finance and mobility – due to quantum computing. The McKinsey report estimates the Quantum computing market size to be between $45 billion to $131 billion by 2040. Precedence Research appears more conservative and probably more grounded (You’ll see why). According to their report, the market for quantum computing is around $1 billion as of this year and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 30.9% from 2024 to 2034, reaching a size of $16 billion by the end of the forecast period. The US is expected to comprise $7 billion of the projected quantum market pie by the end of 2034. The market in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.2% from 2024-2034. As of 2023, North America unsurprisingly comprises 61% of the quantum-computing market. As we point out in a similar article from May, analyzing the quantum-computing equity market based on an ETF exposed to it is a bit tricky. Very few companies have core business related to quantum computing and most companies in these ETFs have peripheral Quantum computing projects but are big and high-performing in other industries that are core to their business, so an ETF’s performance wouldn’t be saying much about the quantum computing industry. Therefore, we’ll delve a little deeper to see what actual challenges there are in the industry and whether they can be practically solved for the delivery of a return on investment as far as scalable practical use cases go. Solving Quantum computing is akin to a Herculean labor. It’s hard to argue with the laws of physics, and when it comes to Quantum computing, a major problem yet to be overcome is Decoherence-induced errors. Decoherence is the enabler of transition from Quantum physics to the everyday physics we experience. Qubits (the quantum equivalent of bits) can only remain in a superposition as long as there’s no interaction with the environment. Even the slightest interaction causes them to decohere to classical bits, introducing computing errors. The hard part is to keep them in a superposition long enough for quantum computation to be viable. Further, to scale quantum computing, you have to add more qubits to the system, but adding more qubits, in principle, increases the probability of error. Finally, any approaches to error correction must obey the Quantum no-cloning theorem, which makes these approaches inherently more challenging than their classical counterparts. In 2022, Azure Quantum demonstrated the soundness of physics required to build topological qubits (these qubits are different in that they can maintain coherence for longer and would thereby lead to a reduced error rate through more stability). On the other hand, Researchers at Quantum AI, an arm of another big tech company, made a breakthrough in 2023, demonstrating a reduced error rate even with an increased number of traditional Qubits. However, rare correlated error events that happened roughly every hour limited the exceptionally low error rate required for practical quantum computing, with more research required to tackle them. Despite these steps, the challenges remain to be effectively overcome. It’s anyone’s guess how long it’ll take for quantum computers to scale and become economically viable. If the amount of capital being invested by venture capital firms in the industry is any guide, it certainly doesn’t look good for the industry as of recent. According to IQM’s State-of-Quantum Report of 2024, the venture capital invested in Quantum startups dropped by 50% worldwide in 2023 compared to the year prior, with the US quantum startup ecosystem seeing the greatest decline of capital at 80%. As far as public equity in the quantum computing industry goes, it is overall yet to be profitable. The industry hasn’t experienced any operating leverage in any meaningful sense and is focused on growing revenue in its early stage. The hard problems with regards to practicality and scalability has resulted in many quantum computing stocks trade at price levels that make them non-compliant with stock exchanges, resulting in delisting threats by stock exchanges. Also read why Jim Cramer can’t recommend a particular quantum computing stock here. For our list, we’ve selected companies that have a presence in the quantum computing industry and ranked them on the basis of their 12-month price upside on analysts’ consensus. Please note that we have used the median upside because average upsides can be greatly affected by outlier analysts on either side of the low or high. For some stocks, both mean and median upsides were too low, but since we wanted to limit our list to pure-play stocks as much as we could, we chose them using the high end of the upside, provided that at least 9 analysts had contributed to their average upside. Finally, we ranked the stocks on weighted scores, with median upside having a weight of 0.4 while analyst count having a weight of 0.6. For stocks for which we have used high-end of the upside, the weight for the upside is 0.2, with analyst-count weight reduced to 0.4. For stocks whose upside is based on only one analyst, and if the upside is over 30%, we assigned weights of 0.01 to both the upside and the analyst count. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

A shot of a commercial plane with a blur of color in the background, representing the production of auxiliary power units in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment. High Upside Potential: 9.74% Number of Analysts: 9 Insider Monkey Weighted Score: 5.5 Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a conglomerate headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. The company operates in several industries like aerospace, energy, logistics, technology and healthcare, among others. The conglomerate operates in the quantum computing industry through its company Quantinuum, which was formed after the merger of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambrige Quantum. Among Quantinuum’s quantum partners are Airbus and BMW Group. In quantum, the company is known for ion-trapped qubits that it claims are easier to manufacture and control. The advantages offered by the approach are high fidelity and long coherence times. Compared to other technologies like superconducting qubits, trapped ions have shown better error rates. In January 2024, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) raised $300 million for Quantinuum, bringing the company’s valuation to $5 billion. This funding round, led by partners like JPMorgan Chase, has boosted investor confidence in Honeywell’s quantum initiatives. According to reports, Honeywell is considering an IPO for Quantinuum as early as 2025 and is reportedly looking for a valuation of $10 billion for its subsidiary. In its 2030 roadmap, the company said it would have a working universal quantum computer it calls Apollo by the end of the decade. A total of 9 analysts have rated the stock, and although the median upside is -3.31%, we ranked it on its upside from the high end, which stands at 9.74%. Overall, HON ranks 10th on our list of best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of HON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM): ‘The Big Home Builder Reported What Looked Like A Jim-dandy Quarter’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. On Tuesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, analyzed the day's market activity, shedding light on why some Big Tech stocks gained traction while others struggled. He pointed out that investors are increasingly concerned about the broader economic effects of rising bond yields. Cramer began by questioning how a day could unfold where recent market leaders lose their momentum, prompting money managers to shift back to established favorites like Big Tech. Cramer acknowledged his growing worry about the bond market, noting that since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, bond prices have plummeted. “... Ever since the Fed cut rates last month, right, bond prices have plunged. Bond yields, meaning longer-term interest rates, have soared. Not supposed to happen. But when it does happen, money managers reach for the companies that simply aren't impacted by the change in the 10-year, the 20-year, or the 30-year US Treasurys.” Cramer likened Wall Street to Chinatown, suggesting that sometimes, it defies easy understanding. He remarked that people seem to abandon the market's recent winners in a snap as if discarding hot fries. He then explained that the day’s disappointing earnings reports created confusion, as they didn’t align with the prevailing narrative of strong employment alongside rate cuts. “See, this morning we got a series of earnings reports that just didn't add up. They didn't fit the thesis. They were disappointing. They don't jive with a rather benign moment when we have the Fed cutting rates, yet employment remains strong. When we get these problematic quarters, several in one day, I might add, money managers default back to the tried and true growth stories that we all know and love. Yes, Titans of Tech. You know what? These managers can't help themselves. They feel they have to rotate out of what was hot at one point and into something else that's not that impacted by the big rate-cut cycle.” READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch He addressed the “alleged earnings disappointment,” clarifying that he chose the term “alleged” because he holds these companies in high regard and does not want to undermine their reputations. Cramer stated that when the 10-year Treasury yields rise, money flows back to these tech giants. He noted that on days like Tuesday, large investors often become apprehensive about cyclical stocks, with concerns about various sectors like aerospace, home building, and even auto parts. He reassured viewers that this phenomenon is familiar; it has been a recurring theme for over a decade. Cramer suggested that money could just as easily rotate back to previous favorites, but it might take a day or two for that to happen, which shows the volatility of the current market environment. Concluding, Cramer noted that Big Tech experienced a significant resurgence. He remarked: “But the bottom line, Big Tech made a big comeback today because of the bond market, not anything to do with the stocks themselves. So, keep in mind that the pause in the rally is temporary, even as you should still own some of the Magnificent Seven for diversification.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 22. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Construction workers laying bricks during the residential development of multiple lots. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 Cramer commented on PulteGroup, Inc.’s (NYSE:PHM) offering of incentives to reel in home buyers. Here’s what he had to say: “Then we go to Pulte Group. Yeah, the big home builder reported what looked like a Jim-dandy quarter, but when you look underneath, you see newfound “rot”, incentives, that was the point. Pulte has to now offer incentives for people to buy homes. The conference call bummed people out because CFO, Bob O'Shaughnessy said, and I'm gonna quote here, ‘We expect incentives to remain elevated for at least the remainder of the year’. PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) is a leading homebuilder in the United States, engaged in acquiring and developing land for residential purposes and constructing a variety of housing options. In its third-quarter earnings report released on October 22, the company reported a net income of $698 million, which shows a rise from $639 million in the same period last year. The growth translated to earnings of $3.35 per share, up from $2.90 per share in the prior year. Home Sale revenues also saw a significant boost, climbing 12% to reach $4.3 billion. The company reported net new orders totaling 7,031 homes during the quarter, indicating strong demand in the housing market. At the close of the third quarter, its backlog comprised 12,089 homes valued at $7.7 billion. However, PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) faced challenges related to increased incentive costs, which impacted its profit margins. Incentives offered to buyers during the quarter reached 7%, marking a sequential increase of 70 basis points from the previous quarter. Management acknowledged that competitive market conditions necessitated higher incentives to maintain sales momentum and efficiently manage assets. Overall PHM ranks 11th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of PHM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PHM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best FAANG Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. Each of the big tech stocks has revealed its plans to invest $50 to $100 billion in GPU compute, evidence that Artificial intelligence may be the biggest theme right now. On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research’s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence. The third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well. READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch and 10 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark. Wang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold. FAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let’s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Analyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 10.9% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 130 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. 2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies such as the industry’s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. To keep its strategy active, on October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom’s subsidiary, T-Systems. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider. On June 13, Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, appeared in an Interview on Yahoo Finance where she shared her bullish stance on AVGO. Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man’s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components. As Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence. ClearBridge Investments’ ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: "In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket." Overall AVGO ranks 4th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. 2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies such as the industry’s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. To keep its strategy active, on October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom’s subsidiary, T-Systems. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider. On June 13, Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, appeared in an Interview on Yahoo Finance where she shared her bullish stance on AVGO. Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man’s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components. As Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence. ClearBridge Investments’ ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: "In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket." Overall AVGO ranks 4th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Meta’s Earnings

Meta (META) will report earnings after the market closes Wednesday, with investors watching whether the social media giant's stock can keep up its strong performance so far this year. Analysts expect Meta to post third-quarter revenue of $40.25 billion, surging nearly 18% year-over-year. Net income is projected to land at $13.56 billion or $5.20 per share, up from $11.58 billion or $4.39 per share a year ago. Meta shares popped after the social media giant reported in July that it's seen early gains from artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize user engagement, benefitting its ad business. Deutsche Bank analysts told clients earlier this month they expect Meta's AI-driven optimization campaign to continue to bring "durable ad wallet share gains.” Meta posted advertising revenue of $38.33 billion in the second quarter, with the Street consensus sitting at $39.54 for the third quarter. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in July that Meta AI is "on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.” In September, Meta released Llama 3.2, its most capable open-source AI model yet, in its efforts to compete with Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, and Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic. Ahead of the company's earnings call, Bank of America analysts called the social media giant a “top AI pick,” pointing to strong core ad growth, growing core app usage among younger users, and the capability of the company’s large language model. All but one of the 31 analysts covering Meta tracked by Visible Alpha hold a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock, with an average price target of $612.34, implying about 7% upside from Friday's closing price. Meta shares have surged more than 60% since the start of the year, finishing Friday at $573.25.

Title: AIL Preview: Cork Con and Clontarf aiming to bounce back

Defending champions Cork Constitution and Clontarf meet again at Temple Hill on Saturday in a reprise of last April’s memorable semi-final which the home side won by 40-34, but in altogether different circumstances. While Clontarf lead the table and Con sit six points adrift in seventh place, both teams are seeking to bounce back from sobering defeats last week against Terenure and Lansdowne respectively. Con start the Munster academy and Emerging Ireland hooker Danny Sheahan and have also promoted Killian Coughlan at outside centre and lock Seán Duffy, as Matthew Bowen continues at fullback. Andy Wood has rotated his entire frontrow, with Barry Gray starting and the prolific Dylan Donnellan on the bench, while also promoting lock Jim Peters and centre Victor Allen. Terenure, a point behind Clontarf, start Fintan Gunne alongside fellow academy halfback Casper Gabriel for the first time at home to City of Armagh in a partnership rich with potential. Marcus Hanan starts at loosehead while Armagh bring in outhalf Evin Crummie, prop Niall Carville and backrower Barry Finn in a team featuring centre Sam Berman, the former St Michael’s and Irish Under-20 centre whose form with Terenure last season earned him an Ulster academy spot. Young Munster and Lansdowne, level on 10 points in sixth and fifth, meet at Tom Clifford Park. Munsters, beaten 26-25 at home by Ballynahinch as all six Limerick sides lost last week, bring in scrumhalf Jake O’Riordon and loosehead Peter Meyer. Without Cormac Foley and Charlie Tector, Lansdowne name James Kenny and James McMahon at halfback. There’s an interesting match-up in the Ballynahinch-Garryowen game where Ieland Sevens winger Zac Ward comes up against Garryowen’s Munster signing from Connacht, Diarmuid Kilgallen, after his recovery from a hamstring injury. Garryowen name Brian Gleeson as well as Academy halves Jack Oliver and Dylan Hicks. UCD welcome back centre Ben Brownlee and number eight Diarmuid Mangan to supplement a side containing fellow Leinster academy players Ruben Moloney, Rory McGuire, Conor Ó Tighearnaigh and Alan Spicer for the visit of St Mary’s, who make three changes up front but keep their potent backline intact. After last week’s big win in Nenagh Ormond to move top of 1B, Old Belvedere are on the road again, albeit just up the road to face Old Wesley in Donnybrook. Second-placed UCC are in Naas, Nenagh host Highfield and Blackrock head to Queen’s in what looks like a competitive and unpredictable division, witness the Thomond Park clash of two relegated sides, Shannon and Trinity, in a meeting of ninth and seventh. Something has to give in the pick of the 2A ties this season when Corinthians, average age just under 20, host Instonians on the Tuam Road, each having earned four bonus point wins. Corinthians’ more all-court game, orchestrated by outhalf Seán Naughton, inflicted one of just two defeats on Instonians in their last 40 AIL games at Corinthian Park last season, but the latter have a powerful maul; witness seven tries already by hooker Neil Saulters. Men’s Division 1A:_Ballynahinch v Garryowen, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v Clontarf, Temple Hill; Terenure v City of Armagh, Lakelands Paek; UCD v St. Mary’s College, Belfield; Young Munster v Lansdowne, Tom Clifford Park.

Title: The billionaire owners of the Washington Post and L.A. Times just capitulated to Trump

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Once upon a time, after the publisher decided our newspaper would endorse a candidate that those of us on the editorial board didn’t prefer, a colleague circled the date on the calendar and joked that it was “Reminder That We Work for The Man Day.” We knew, even if readers didn’t, that newspaper endorsements don’t always reflect a consensus or the majority opinion of its editorial writers. I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent. Mariel garza, former editorials editor for los angeles times At The Los Angeles Times, the man in charge is Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire doctor and founder of the health care software company NantHealth who spent $500 million for the newspaper in 2018. Soon-Shiong’s decision to block the paper from endorsing California’s own Kamala Harris for president, as its board was reportedly planning to do, led to Donald Trump crowing and the paper’s editorials editor quitting. “I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,” Mariel Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review. “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.” Two more members of the newspaper's editorial board resigned after Garza did. At The Washington Post, the world’s third-richest man, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, is The Man. And his venerable newspaper, which he bought in 2013 for $250 million, will not endorse a presidential candidate this year. And won’t going forward, according to its relatively new publisher and chief executive, Will Lewis. “The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election,” Lewis wrote on the newspaper’s website Friday. “We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.” The newspaper, Lewis writes, didn’t endorse in presidential races from 1960 to 1972 but did from 1976 to 2020. The newspaper endorsed Joe Biden in 2020. It endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, but almost three months before that, it had declared Trump “a unique threat to American democracy.” As The Washington Post did, from 2008 to 2020, the L.A. Times endorsed Barack Obama twice and then Clinton and Biden. Importantly, the L.A. Times endorsed Harris in 2014 when she was the state’s attorney general running for re-election and then endorsed her successful 2016 U.S. Senate run. To Garza’s point, the stakes are high in this election, at least for people who aren’t billionaires. And we have to consider the possibilities that the leaders of these newspapers are OK with Trump — or terrified of him. Given the size and influence of these papers, neither of those possibilities is comforting. On X, Marty Baron, a former executive editor of The Washington Post who was in charge when the paper adopted “Democracy Dies in Darkness” as its slogan, responded to Lewis’ piece: “This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.” He said Trump “will see this as invitation to further intimidate” Bezos, and he called it “Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.” According to a Washington Post story about the nonendorsement that cited two sources briefed on the events, “The decision not to publish was made by The Post’s owner — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.” It certainly appears that Soon-Shiong and Bezos are less concerned with their newspaper’s duty to the public and to history and more worried about what might happen to them if Trump wins and carries out his plans of retribution. As important as it is to save newspapers, an obvious downside of billionaires coming to the rescue is their influence on those publications and their editorial pages. (On top of that, these billionaire owners have not put an end to the layoffs of journalists or the offers of buyouts that plagued major publications before they were “rescued” by them.) Granted, there are questions about how effective endorsements are. According to the American Presidency Project, which looked at the country’s top 100 newspapers by circulation, in 2016, 57 newspapers (with a combined circulation of 13,095,067) endorsed Clinton for president. Another three newspapers with a combined circulation of 3,243,140 urged their readers not to vote for Trump, and 26 didn’t endorse. The Las Vegas Review-Journal and The Florida Times-Union (combined circulation of 315,666) were the only two that endorsed Trump. Granted, there are questions about how effective endorsements are. Little good that did Clinton, though. She lost. Not the popular vote, of course, but, still, she lost. What’s striking is that in 2020, there were almost as many of those newspapers that didn’t endorse (44) as the 47 that endorsed the eventual winner, Biden. (Trump received seven endorsements that time.) There are likely multiple reasons for smaller newspapers declining to endorse, including public assumptions that endorsements govern news coverage and the anger that such endorsements inevitably cause. It is far more likely that a newspaper subscriber will cancel their subscription if the paper endorses the candidate they oppose than it is that someone who doesn’t subscribe will become a reader because their candidate was endorsed. It’s a high-risk/no-reward proposition. But it’s still something newspapers do, and if other owners and publishers can take the risks, then billionaires certainly can. Soon-Shiong posted a comment on X Wednesday that mischaracterizes what editorials boards do: The Editorial Board was provided the opportunity to draft a factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House, and how these policies affected the nation. In addition, the Board was asked to provide their understanding of the policies and plans enunciated by the candidates during this campaign and its potential effect on the nation in the next four years. In this way, with this clear and non-partisan information side-by-side, our readers could decide who would be worthy of being President for the next four years. Instead of adopting this path as suggested, the Editorial Board chose to remain silent and I accepted their decision. An endorsement is not an analysis. It’s an opinion. It picks a candidate in the same way readers will pick one. The path that Soon-Shiong said he suggested is not a path editorial writers and editors would take. Because editorial writers take sides. That said, Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review that she’d received no such request from Soon-Shiong to write an analysis of the candidates. In 2016, almost three months before The Washington Post endorsed Clinton’s candidacy, it published an editorial identifying Trump as “a unique threat” to democracy. It should be noted that the newspaper did that years before “saving democracy” became a theme. Trump’s threat to democracy is even more obvious today. And, yet, the newspaper that tells us that “democracy dies in darkness” can’t be bothered to put up a fight for it. Yes, there may have been hell to pay if the paper had endorsed Harris and Trump won and then turned against the press as he has promised to do. But hell will be visited on more vulnerable people to a much greater degree. It is unforgivable that the ultra-wealthy who have purchased these huge and influential platforms appear to be more concerned with their own interests than the interests of the readers they serve.

Title: Retail Investors Are Buying Up Nvidia and Other Single Stocks. Here's What That Means.

Time Published: 2024-10-25T19:29:38Z

Retail investors have been buying up Nvidia (NVDA) and favoring single stocks over exchange-traded funds lately. That could indicate optimism about the markets. According to Vanda Research, which tracks investment flows from retail buyers and sellers, net retail purchases of Nvidia totaled more than $1.1 billion between Oct. 17 and Oct. 23. Retail investors had inflows totaling $885 million into single stocks versus $497 million into ETFs during that period, Vanda said. "The recent uptick in single stock purchases suggests that confidence levels remain relatively optimistic," wrote Vanda analysts in a Thursday note. "In a more cautious environment we would see purchases of ETFs increase as individuals generally like to stay invested but scale down risk levels by broadening exposure outside of concentrated single-name bets." Tesla (TSLA) was a not-so-close second to Nvidia, attracting more than $353 million of retail investors' dollars between Oct. 17 and Oct. 23. Tesla reported earnings that beat expectations after the ball on the 23rd, causing its shares to rise 22% in yesterday's session. The EV maker's results and outlook rejuvenated interest in the shares, Vanda said, writing that a recent robotaxi event "failed to meet lofty expectations and retail investors began to flock back into their semiconductor darling" — meaning Nvidia. Nvidia's results are due next month. While retail investors are still putting their money in big tech companies like Nvidia, Tesla, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), they're also betting on Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) ahead of election day in the United States. There were $34 million worth of net retail purchases of "DJT" between Oct. 17 and Oct. 23, Vanda said. "DJT has historically been regarded as a 'meme stock', but now it’s increasingly being used by retail speculators as a vehicle to bet on a Trump win at the upcoming US election," wrote Vanda analysts.

Title: MicroStrategy Pushes Higher As BlackRock Buys In, But Peter Schiff Sees A Crash Ahead

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) continues its upward sprint, reaching a 52-week high of $236.29 during Thursday trading, with investors rallying behind the stock. The stock's meteoric rise—up 55% in the past month and 244% year-to-date—signals renewed investor confidence in the company's strategic mix of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) investments and AI-powered software advancements. Over the past year, MicroStrategy has soared an incredible 444%, and many are betting that this momentum will keep going. Don’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! A significant driver of the optimism comes from BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), which recently expanded its stake to 5.2% in MicroStrategy, effectively placing a larger bet on the company's unique positioning as a gateway for institutional investors to gain Bitcoin exposure. With Bernstein analysts projecting Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end 2025, it seems BlackRock is bullish on the long-term outlook for both crypto and MicroStrategy. However, not everyone is celebrating. Noted Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has made headlines again, calling MSTR "the most overvalued stock in the MSCI World Index." Schiff warns that when the stock eventually crashes, it'll be a "real bloodbath." Known for advocating gold over Bitcoin, Schiff has long argued that crypto lacks the intrinsic value needed to sustain its current valuations. His sharp criticism adds a dose of skepticism to an otherwise optimistic narrative.

Chart created using Benzinga Pro The stock is currently trading well above its eight-, 20-, and 50-day simple moving averages, reflecting strong buying pressure and a bullish trend that shows no signs of weakening. With the share price at $235.89, MicroStrategy stock's eight-day simple moving average sits at $210.78, signaling continued strength. Similarly, the 20-day simple moving average is $193.16, and the 50-day SMA is $159.06, indicating that momentum is solid. The long-term trend is equally bullish. MicroStrategy's 200-day simple moving average is at $134.65, far below the current share price. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator stands at 18.66, another indicator of a buy signal, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 73.13, which indicates the stock is in overbought territory. See Also: Despite some warning signs—like the RSI suggesting possible overheating—the overall outlook for MicroStrategy remains positive, at least for now. The company's dual focus on Bitcoin and enterprise AI is winning over institutional players like BlackRock, while skeptics like Schiff continue to warn of an impending collapse.

Title: Microsoft tells shareholders to reject call to invest corporate cash in Bitcoin

As the year comes to an end, Microsoft plans to hold its annual shareholder meeting on December 10th. On this year’s list of “voting items” for shareholders is a proposal to diversify Microsoft’s assets and increase shareholder value by investing in Bitcoin, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published on Thursday. The company’s board of directors is urging shareholders to vote against it. The proposal titled “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin” posits that Microsoft’s current investment in corporate bonds barely outpaces inflation rates and suggests that the company should consider diversifying their assets with Bitcoin, an “excellent, if not the best, hedge against inflation.” “Therefore, in inflationary times like these, corporations should—and perhaps have a fiduciary duty to—to diversify their balance sheets with assets that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile in the short-term,” the proposal said. Beneath the proposal is a section labeled “Board Recommendation” in which Microsoft’s board of directors advises shareholders to vote against the proposal. The board explains that the company does not need to assess investing in Bitcoin because “Microsoft’s management already carefully considers this topic,” the filing said. The tech giant, whose largest shareholders are Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, says it has a Global Treasury and Investment Services team that regularly evaluates a vast array of potential investments to effectively diversify Microsoft’s assets and protect shareholders from inflation. This team has considered Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in past evaluations, Microsoft said in the filing. “Microsoft has strong and appropriate processes in place to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for long-term benefit of shareholders and this requested public assessment is unwarranted,” the filing said. The proposal was set forth by The National Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank. The organization serves as an advisory board member of Project 2025, a far-right policy initiative to expand presidential power and impose a traditionalist social order under the next Republican administration. The proposal notes that while the company should consider investing in Bitcoin, it should not risk shareholder value by investing too much of their assets in the cryptocurrency. The organization suggests that Microsoft “evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 1% of its assets in Bitcoin.” This proposal comes as MicroStrategy, another large tech company, reaches a new high of $241 this year as the company’s strategic pivot toward Bitcoin investment pays off handsomely. The company has amassed 252,220 Bitcoins since 2020, worth about $17 billion. This has led MicroStrategy’s stock to surge 250% over the past year while Microsoft is up 16%. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin Calls Michael Saylor’s View on Bitcoin Corporate Ownership ‘Insane’

Full Content:
Ethereum (ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin is not seeing eye to eye with Microstrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor when it comes to the custody of Bitcoin (BTC). In an interview, Saylor said that unlike with Bitcoin held by unregulated entities, lawmakers and law enforcement authorities are less likely to go after crypto held by regulated public entities such as financial titans BlackRock and JP Morgan. “I think that when Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure.” Buterin responded to Saylor’s statement, saying he does not share the same view about the corporate custody of Bitcoin. “I’ll happily say that I think Saylor’s comments are batshit insane. He seems to be explicitly arguing for a regulatory capture approach to protecting crypto (‘when you have regulated public entities like Blackrock and Fidelity and … holding the asset, all the lawmakers and law enforcement arms are invested in those entities’). There’s plenty of precedent for how this strategy can fail and for me, it’s not what crypto is about.” Following Buterin’s criticism, Saylor said anyone can choose however they want to hold their crypto assets. “I support self-custody for those willing & able, the right to self-custody for all, and freedom to choose the form of custody & custodian for individuals & institutions globally. Bitcoin benefits from all forms of investment by all types of entities, and should welcome everyone.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Nvidia dethrones Apple as the world's most valuable company
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-market-cap-apple-most-valuable-company-nvda-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-25T17:50:35Z
Full Content:
Nvidia briefly eclipsed Apple to become the world's most valuable company on Friday. It's the first time Nvidia has been the world's largest company since mid-June. Nvidia stock jumped as much as 3% on Friday to an intra-day high of $144.13, catapulting its market valuation to $3.53 trillion. In contrast, Apple traded up less than 1%, giving it a market valuation of $3.52 trillion. Nvidia stock has since pared its gains to about 1% and is trading neck-and-neck with Apple's valuation, at $3.52 trillion compared to Apple's $3.53 trillion at 1:24 p.m., according to data from YCharts. The massive size of Nvidia is a testament to its quick ascent since OpenAI released its first version of ChatGPT in November 2022. Since then, shares of Nvidia, which supplies the technology world with AI-enabling GPU chips, have added $3.1 trillion to their market valuation, with their stock price soaring more than 740%. Wall Street believes the gains can continue, with some analysts expecting the stock to eclipse a $4 trillion valuation soon. Bank of America analysts raised their Nvidia price target to $190 last week, citing strong upside and a "generational opportunity" as it grows its lead in the AI space. Meanwhile, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino bumped his price target to $160 as an "AI war" takes place among the major cloud companies. "The higher multiple and target reflect our higher conviction that NVDA will post results that exceed our/consensus views in CY 25, as Blackwell ramps. As we previously cited, Blackwell will take greater wallet share from hyperscalers (e.g., greater GPU, CPU, networking, and software revenue) amid an AI war in the cloud," Zino wrote. All eyes will be on Nvidia when they report their third-quarter earnings results next month. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Fantasy Basketball Waiver Wire Week 2: Dyson Daniels' new role could yield improved Fantasy numbers, more
URL: https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/fantasy-basketball-waiver-wire-week-2-dyson-daniels-new-role-could-yield-improved-fantasy-numbers-more/
Time Published: 2024-10-25T16:46:29Z
Full Content:
If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Welcome back! I missed the NBA. And I missed you, dear readers. Glad to have this space we can share together again. It's been a bizarre opening week. Half of the first 12 games were double-digit blowouts, and four of last season's top-14 per-game fantasy producers missed Game 1. As opening weeks go, these complications mean we've learned less than we'd hoped, but we've still learned plenty. We can learn infinitely more from a single lopsided and injury-riddled regular season game than the entire preseason and training camp put together. As you'd expect, the waiver wire is deep this week. Two players are stop-everything-go-now must-adds, and a whole lot more have attractive potential. And, of course, our annual cautionary note: don't panic-drop your middle-round picks. Jonathan Kuminga and Jabari Smith put up disappointing stats in their first games, but there's a reason they were widely hyped by analysts and went inside the top 100 in every industry draft I was a part of. Smith, in fact, was also featured in this paragraph after an Opening Night dud last year – he finished the season safely inside the top 90, mildly beating expectations. Don't panic on earlier picks with tremendous upside after one disappointing night. As we do every year, the players in this article must be rostered in less than two-thirds of CBS leagues. Players are listed in the order that I recommend adding them, assuming they are equally good fits for your team. Players rostered in more than two-thirds of leagues but who are still under-rostered. Double-check to make sure they aren't available in your league. In many cases, these players qualified for this article before big opening night performances, meaning managers with once-weekly waiver runs are particularly likely to see these players still available. Walker Kessler, Jazz (80% rostered) Dereck Lively, Mavericks (71% rostered) Jalen Suggs, Magic (80% rostered) Brook Lopez, Bucks (77% rostered)Cameron Johnson, Nets (75% rostered) Jeremy Sochan, Spurs (69% rostered) Andrew Wiggins, Warriors (81% rostered)Ben Simmons, Nets (82% rostered) Dyson Daniels, Hawks (43% rostered) Daniels started and played 35 minutes in the opener. Securing that massive role is, by far, the most important reason that Daniels is this week's top add. The fact that he was wildly productive – 15-5-2 with five steals, two 3s, and a block – is a nice bonus, but he'd be addable regardless. The 21-year-old former lottery pick was buried on the Pelicans' depth chart before coming to Atlanta in the Dejounte Murray trade last summer. Daniels' per-minute productivity was mediocre, but earning the start and playing big minutes over a healthy Bogdan Bogdanovic likely implies that Daniels will get enough work to rack up stats. He's likely to be most helpful on defense, with low-ish scoring and decent rebounds and assists. Note: I would prioritize Daniels over everyone listed in "double-check your leagues," except for Kessler. Onyeka Okongwu, Hawks (61% rostered) If the Hawks' minute distribution in their first game is indicative of what will happen all season, then calling Okongwu a must-add is underselling it. Fantasy managers have known about Okongwu's great per-minute productivity for years, pining for the day when he'd finally see a full workload. In the opener, he played 28 minutes off the bench, while starter Clint Capela played only 20. It's only one game, but it was a real game – and there was no blowout, foul trouble, or injury to muddle the data. The Hawks' second game is Friday night at 7:30 ET. If you're reading this after that game, and Okongwu once again saw 28-ish minutes while Capela played 22 or fewer, then go ahead and flip him ahead of Daniels for this week's top pickup. Note: I would prioritize Okongwu over Wiggins and Simmons, listed in "double-check your leagues" above. Mark Williams, Hornets (62% rostered) Williams (foot) will miss the second game of the season, an ominous start after playing in just 62 games combined through his first two seasons. That said, waiver pickups are free, and he's really productive when he plays. Last season, he averaged 13-10 with 1.1 blocks and 0.8 steals in just 26.7 minutes. Especially if you have an IR spot, add Williams, stash him, and then add someone else. Note: I would prioritize Williams over Wiggins and Simmons, listed in "double-check your leagues" above. Norman Powell, Clippers (63% rostered) The Clippers are short-staffed. With Kawhi Leonard (knee) out indefinitely and P.J. Tucker permanently away from the team, they lack rotation players. We learned Wednesday that part of their plan to replace all of those players is to just give all their minutes to Powell. He played 40 in the opener, tying teammate James Harden for the third-most by any player so far this season. With that many minutes, it would be hard to avoid making a fantasy impact. Powell should score a lot while also helping in 3s and steals. Note: I would prioritize Powell over Wiggins and Simmons, listed in "double-check your leagues" above. Rui Hachimura, Lakers (52% rostered) Hachimura took over as a starter shortly before the All-Star break last season. Over those final two months of the season, he averaged 16-5-1 with 1.8 3s in 31 minutes per game while shooting 56-45-76. If the 35 minutes he played in the opener is indicative of a further increasing role, then Hachimura should easily flirt with the top 100, and that's without factoring in any improvement for the 26-year-old. Trayce Jackson-Davis, Warriors (46% rostered) Another player who took over as a starter late last season and carried that promotion into the new campaign. He averaged 11-8-2 with 2.4 stocks in 25.4 minutes in his 11 full-time starts, and his opening night workload mirrored that. Jackson-Davis was drafted in most industry leagues, and his roster rate is much higher on other host sites – he's only so widely available because CBS had an unusually low default rank on him in their draft room. He's highly likely to reach a near-universal roster rate within a couple of weeks. Yves Missi, Pelicans (25% rostered) The Pelicans probably have the worst center depth chart in the league. It's just Daniel Theis, Missi, the 21st pick in last June's draft, and Karlo Matkovic. Matkovic was a late second-round pick in 2022 who spent last season in the G-League and made his NBA debut in the final minute of Wednesday night's game. Theis started but played only 19 minutes to Missi's 23. Missi was having a good game, and the margin was somewhat small, so we'll need to keep watching to see if this pattern continues. But if it does, Missi could emerge as an excellent source of defensive stats. In the "actions speak louder than words" department, Missi was the first player in this column that I actually went out and added in my own competitive leagues (in part because the players listed above were already rostered). Andre Drummond, 76ers (55% rostered) When Joel Embiid is out, Drummond needs to be in lineups. It's that simple. I don't think Drummond will have much utility while Embiid is playing, hence Drummond's low-ish placement in this column. But he's a must-start any time Embiid is out, and we already know Embiid (knee) will be out on Friday. De'Andre Hunter, Hawks (40% rostered) Despite foul trouble, Hunter still managed 26 minutes in an opening night start. That's a great sign for a chronically underrated Fantasy contributor. Hunter has popped up in this column repeatedly over the past two seasons, averaging basically 16-4-2 with nearly two 3s while playing around 30 minutes per game. His workload in the debut implies another season of a similar role, which means another season of rosterability for as long as he can stay healthy. After Missi, Hunter was the second player I added in my own leagues this week. Bilal Coulibaly, Wizards (47% rostered) It was kind of unfair for the Wizards to kick off their schedule against the Celtics. The two teams are just in completely different classes. But one of the few bright spots in their merciless drubbing was Coulibaly, who put up 8-6-6 with a steal in 30 minutes. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was solid production and a lot of minutes against a great opponent. It might not turn into anything, but this is the sort of performance that can easily build into a breakout campaign. Toumani Camara, Trail Blazers (10% rostered) Generally speaking, I think the fantasy basketball community underrates the "he's just a good player" factor, especially when it comes to surprising players like Camara. A good recent parallel is Herb Jones, who, like Camara, was a defense-first, second-round pick who surprised everyone by forcing his way into a large rotation role as a rookie. That undeniability usually matters. Camara isn't as good as Jones, but he is a good defender who has earned a large role in the rotation. He played 30 minutes as a starter in the opener, though, granted, that was without Shaedon Sharpe (shoulder) and Matisse Thybulle (knee). Sharpe is the more serious threat, so we'll see what happens when he returns (expected in about two weeks). Even with that looming threat, however, I like Camara as a flier to see if he can maintain this workload and what happens to his numbers as he continues to improve. Other recommendations: Al Horford, Celtics (54% rostered); Nikola Jovic, Heat (23% rostered); Tre Mann, Hornets (25% rostered) Dalton Knecht, Lakers Knecht barely did enough to warrant a blurb, but he was the most popular pickup on CBS this week after playing a larger-than-expected 16 minutes on opening night, so I wanted to address him. It is an excellent sign that Knecht appears to be starting the season firmly in the rotation. The rookie sharpshooter could be a solid contributor if he earns a larger role. But first, he'll have to hold onto these minutes once Jarred Vanderbilt (foot) returns). Knecht's surprisingly lengthy appearance Tuesday increases his dynasty appeal. But he's droppable if you drafted him in a standard-sized league. Lonzo Ball, Bulls Another of the week's most popular pickups that need to be dropped. It is very exciting to see Ball back in action after nearly three years away. If he ever gets anything near full health and a full workload, he'll be rosterable. But he played 14 minutes in the opener. Keep an eye on the transaction page in your league – the following injured players have seen their roster rates fall meaningfully over the past week. As evidence of these players' value, all of these players were selected well inside the top 100 in recent industry drafts. Let other managers' impatience be your benefit. Isaiah Hartenstein, Thunder (71% rostered) – out at least four more weeks Trey Murphy, Pelicans (66% rostered) – out at least two more weeks Ausar Thompson, Pistons (50% rostered) – out indefinitely Toumani Camara, Trail Blazers (10% rostered) Just making sure you noticed that Camara is 10% available. His blurb is in the "adds for all leagues" section. Miles McBride, Knicks (21% rostered) McBride was the clear sixth man for the Knicks on Opening Night. The blowout was obvious early, so it's unclear how many minutes that will translate to during a competitive game – but, historically, it's been a profitable position under substitution-challenged coach Tom Thibodeau. Last season, in the 20 games where he played between 19-33 minutes, he averaged 11-2-2 with 2.1 3s and 1.1 steals (while averaging 24.9 minutes). If he is, in fact, firmly entrenched as the sixth man, then that strikes me as a realistic and possibly slightly conservative expectation of what we might see from him moving forward. Other recommendations: Bruce Brown, Raptors (8% rostered); Dean Wade, Cavaliers (1% rostered); Derrick Jones Jr, Clippers (5% rostered) © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.

Election 2024 coverage presented by Lazard (LAZ), a 175-year old global financial services and asset management company, is the latest among traditional financial players jumping on the asset tokenization trend, planning to create tokenized funds with Bitfinex Securities and SkyBridge Invest. The tokenized funds will be set up and issued under Kazakhstan's financial services law, under regulatory oversight of Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA), where SkyBridge and Bitfinex are licensed to operate. Bitfinex Securities is responsible for the tokenization process, while SkyBridge will act as broker and manager of the tokenized fund. The products will be available to retail users, but with certain geographic limitations, and available to be purchased with Tether's stablecoin (USDT). Representatives of the companies involved signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) toward creating the tokenized funds on Friday in Lugano, Switzerland at a side event during the Plan B conference. The vehicle will offer exposure in a "fund of funds" structure to various existing Lazard-managed funds focused on global equities and emerging market equities, which have been available only to professional investors and institutions before, Matthias Kruse, managing director at Lazard, told CoinDesk. "We are a B2B [business-to-business] investment firm, and this is a good way for us to service retail investors," Kruse said. Kruse also touted tokenization as a process that improves efficiency, liquidity and helps lower operational costs. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is a rapidly growing sector in the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance that involves placing assets such as bonds, credit and funds on blockchain rails. Participants do so in pursuit of faster settlements and increased efficiency compared to traditional financial plumbing. The tokenization trend came to the forefront this year with global banks and asset managers, including BlackRock, HSBC starting offering tokenized products. The RWA market is poised to become a multi-trillion dollar market over the coming years, according to McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein. Lazard's asset management business has $245 billion of assets under management (AUM). SkyBridge Invest is a Kazakhstan-based investment services firm, different from SkyBridge Capital of veteran Wall Street hedge funder Anthony Scaramucci. Bitfinex Securities is a licensed trading venue in El Salvador and Kazakhstan. Bitfinex Securities is the tokenization platform arm of crypto trading venue Bitfinex. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

Title: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's compensation rises 63% to $79.11 million despite his request for a pay cut
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/105302-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-compensation-rises-63-7911.html

What just happened? In a scenario that the vast majority of us will never experience, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has seen his take-home pay increase 63% compared to last year despite the CEO requesting the amount he receives be reduced. While Nadella's salary was cut by 50%, other forms of his compensation increased significantly, bringing his total to $79.11 million in fiscal 2024, up from $48.51 million a year earlier. Nadella requested that his pay be reduced as a reflection of his accountability in relation to the company's security failures, including the major cyberattacks against Microsoft's and the CrowdStrike fiasco. The incidents led to Nadella making security a "top priority" above all else at Microsoft, which now ties employee bonuses and promotions to security performance. Microsoft's board compensation committee agreed to Nadella's request, reducing his cash incentive from the $10.7 million he was set to receive by more than 50% to $5.2 million. Like most CEOs, the majority of Nadella's compensation – around 90% – comes in the form of stock awards. This year saw those awards increase from $39 million in 2023 to around $71 million as Microsoft's market cap passed $3 trillion. "The Board reviewed the Company's performance and firmly believes that Mr. Nadella provided exceptional leadership and was both critical in achieving the extremely strong performance of the Company and personally responsible for the ongoing repositioning of its investments and priorities," the Microsoft Compensation Committee wrote in a filing. "It also considered the factors that Mr. Nadella raised in requesting a reduction of his cash incentive and concluded that such an adjustment was appropriate." Surprisingly, this isn't the largest award Nadella has received during his time at the head of Microsoft. He was paid $84 million in 2014, the same year he became the Redmond giant's third chief executive. Other Microsoft execs also received a pay bump. President Brad Smith's compensation was up 29% to $23.4 million, while Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood saw a 30% increase to $25.8 million. Microsoft's valuation has increased by more than tenfold in the decade since Nadella took over from Steve Ballmer. Its share price has continued to grow in recent times, up from $327 one year ago to $427 today. It is currently the third-largest company in the world by market cap, sitting behind Nvidia and leader Apple. TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Title: Weight loss drugs have yet to lower patients' health care costs

GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy (NVO) might help with weight loss, but they aren’t leading to lower health care costs yet, according to a new analysis of U.S. health insurance claims. A review by pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics, and reported by Reuters, found that patients with obesity incurred average annual medical costs of $18,507 two years after starting GLP-1 drugs, a 46% increase from before they were on the drugs. For comparison, medical costs for a control group not using GLP-1 drugs rose by 14% over the same period. The analysis found that prescription drug costs were the primary driver of these increases, with other medical expenses also rising during the two years on the drug. It showed no reduction in obesity-related medical events — such as heart attacks, strokes, and type 2 diabetes diagnoses, compared to the control group. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY) — the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, both GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss — into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know However, many U.S. employers and government insurance programs have been hesitant to cover these medications due to their high initial costs and uncertainty about long-term savings. Prime Therapeutics analyzed the pharmacy and medical claims of 3,046 commercially insured patients who received new GLP-1 prescriptions for obesity in 2021, excluding those already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Among the GLP-1 users, 46% were taking Wegovy or Ozempic, while others were on Saxenda, Victoza, Rybelsus, or Lilly’s Trulicity. Newer drugs, such as Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound, were not included since they launched after study started. The analysis also highlighted adherence challenges. Only 25% of patients who were prescribed Wegovy or Ozempic for weight loss were still taking the medication two years later. This low adherence rate makes it challenging to replicate the results shown in clinical trials, according to Prime Therapeutics VP for pharmacy clinical services David Lassen. “I don’t think it’s fully conclusive at this point,” Lassen told Reuters (TRI). He noted that more data and time may be necessary to fully gauge the costs. “We want to do everything possible to help individuals achieve the positive outcomes of being on this medication,” Lassen said. “But if we determine there is not a positive outcome with our data and there is not a return on investment, that will be an inflection point ahead that we will have to consider.” Prime’s assistant VP for health outcomes Patrick Gleason estimated that GLP-1 drugs will cost employers and insurers about $11,200 more per patient over the first two years, despite discounts and rebates. The company said that fewer than 20% of its members have coverage for these weight-loss drugs. Still, it supports clients who choose to cover GLP-1s when combined with lifestyle modification programs. Prime manages pharmacy benefits for about 38 million people and is owned by 19 U.S. Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance plans.

Title: Microsoft Board says no to Bitcoin: What’s behind the decision?

Microsoft’s board evaluates Bitcoin, but advises against adopting this strategy now. Microsoft’s upcoming shareholder meeting on the 10th of December is set to capture significant attention. A notable proposal for the tech giant to explore Bitcoin [BTC] investments will be a part of the meeting’s agenda. According to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microsoft’s board and shareholders will address several key issues at the meeting. These include the suggestion to adopt BTC as a hedge against inflation and broader economic shifts. However, Microsoft’s board has advised a vote against this proposal, stating that the company has already given careful consideration to such strategies, according to the filing. As outlined in a company statement opposing the proposal, Microsoft emphasized its stance against Bitcoin investment. “Past evaluations have included Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among the options considered, and Microsoft continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making.” This proposal, initiated by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), pointed to MicroStrategy’s notable Bitcoin investment approach, which it claims has outperformed Microsoft’s stock by over 300% in the past year despite the smaller scale of MicroStrategy’s operations. The NCPPR also highlighted the growing trend of institutional and corporate interest in BTC. This included through spot Bitcoin ETFs, and argued that, although Bitcoin remains volatile, it could act as a potential hedge against inflation and declining corporate bond yields. ”At minimum, companies should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 1% of its assets in Bitcoin.” BTC institutional holdings has grown remarkably, with top players like Satoshi Nakamoto, Binance, BlackRock, Grayscale, and MicroStrategy all steadily increasing their stakes in the leading cryptocurrency. Hence, the race to secure Bitcoin has intensified to the point where BTC ETFs are nearing the total holdings attributed to Nakamoto, as highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In fact, MicroStrategy’s prominent Bitcoin acquisition strategy has further inspired entities such as Japan’s Metaplanet. The organization recently raised 10 billion Yen through a fresh stock issuance as part of its 11th series of Stock Acquisition Rights. Tesla’s Q3 report also underscored its role as the fourth-largest BTC holder among U.S.-listed firms, trailing MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Riot Platforms. Moreover, SpaceX’s 8,285 BTC—valued at roughly $560 million—cements its position as the seventh-largest private Bitcoin holder. As of the 25th of October, BTC was trading at $67,576.65, showing a 1.02% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. In contrast, Microsoft (MSFT) shares saw minimal movement, closing at $424.7 on the 24th of October with a slight uptick of 0.03%, per Google Finance. By the 25th of October, MSFT shares had inched up further to $424.73, marking a modest 0.13% rise.

Title: AST SpaceMobile: SpaceX Is a Bully, Uses Anticompetitive Tactics
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/networking/26573/ast-spacemobile-spacex-is-a-bully-uses-anticompetitive-tactics
Time Published: 2024-10-25T15:44:29Z
Full Content:
AST SpaceMobile is criticizing SpaceX for allegedly using "anticompetitive" tactics to try and override concerns about its cellular Starlink system for phones. "Ironically, SpaceX's own attempt to intimidate and bully its competitors, regulators, and cellular operators is itself anti-competitive and an effort to deflect technical shortcomings of its own system,” AST SpaceMobile tells the Federal Communications Commission. The startup is hitting back after SpaceX sent a letter to the FCC earlier this month, accusing AST SpaceMobile of spreading misinformation meant to “hamstring” its work on the direct-to-cell Starlink system. SpaceX also derided AST SpaceMobile as “meme stock” driven by investors and foreign partners. In response, AST SpaceMobile sent its own letter to the FCC on Thursday, calling out SpaceX for allegedly trying to “manufacture a controversy.” “SpaceX has resorted to hurling unfounded accusations at AST SpaceMobile, a company capable of delivering space-based cellular broadband [device-to-device] connectivity to every American,” the company told the FCC. “AST SpaceMobile respectfully requests that SpaceX refrain from making further inflammatory statements to distract from key MNO [mobile network operator] concerns.” The dispute highlights the simmering competition in the race to deliver satellite connectivity to today’s smartphones. Like SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile is working to launch a high-speed satellite service to help carriers fill dead zones in their cellular coverage. But SpaceX is much closer to launching its own competing service through T-Mobile; it already has 240 satellites in orbit. In contrast, AST only has five satellites in space and may need another year or more before its satellite fleet is large enough to offer continuous coverage over the US. The problem is that SpaceX has been urging the FCC to grant a waiver to loosen the radio emission limits for the cellular Starlink satellites. Without the waiver, the satellites risk losing the ability to power real-time satellite voice calls for consumer phones. However, a growing number of companies—including AT&T and Verizon, key investors of AST SpaceMobile—have been imploring the FCC to reject SpaceX’s request to loosen the radio emission limits, citing their own data showing it’ll generate radio interference for their mobile networks. The regulatory battle has since escalated; a group of European telecommunication firms and partners of AST have also told the FCC they’ll sue if SpaceX receives the necessary waiver to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond the normal limits. AST is now taking a more vocal role in the dispute. In Thursday’s letter to the FCC, the company said it supported the mobile carriers' "legitimate" interference concerns about cellular Starlink technology operating beyond the normal radio emission limits.

Title: AST SpaceMobile: SpaceX Is a Bully, Uses Anticompetitive Tactics

AST SpaceMobile is criticizing SpaceX for allegedly using "anticompetitive" tactics to try and override concerns about its cellular Starlink system for phones. "Ironically, SpaceX's own attempt to intimidate and bully its competitors, regulators, and cellular operators is itself anti-competitive and an effort to deflect technical shortcomings of its own system,” AST SpaceMobile tells the Federal Communications Commission. The startup is hitting back after SpaceX sent a letter to the FCC earlier this month, accusing AST SpaceMobile of spreading misinformation meant to “hamstring” its work on the direct-to-cell Starlink system. SpaceX also derided AST SpaceMobile as “meme stock” driven by investors and foreign partners. In response, AST SpaceMobile sent its own letter to the FCC on Thursday, calling out SpaceX for allegedly trying to “manufacture a controversy.” “SpaceX has resorted to hurling unfounded accusations at AST SpaceMobile, a company capable of delivering space-based cellular broadband [device-to-device] connectivity to every American,” the company told the FCC. “AST SpaceMobile respectfully requests that SpaceX refrain from making further inflammatory statements to distract from key MNO [mobile network operator] concerns.” The dispute highlights the simmering competition in the race to deliver satellite connectivity to today’s smartphones. Like SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile is working to launch a high-speed satellite service to help carriers fill dead zones in their cellular coverage. But SpaceX is much closer to launching its own competing service through T-Mobile; it already has 240 satellites in orbit. In contrast, AST only has five satellites in space and may need another year or more before its satellite fleet is large enough to offer continuous coverage over the US. The problem is that SpaceX has been urging the FCC to grant a waiver to loosen the radio emission limits for the cellular Starlink satellites. Without the waiver, the satellites risk losing the ability to power real-time satellite voice calls for consumer phones. However, a growing number of companies—including AT&T and Verizon, key investors of AST SpaceMobile—have been imploring the FCC to reject SpaceX’s request to loosen the radio emission limits, citing their own data showing it’ll generate radio interference for their mobile networks. The regulatory battle has since escalated; a group of European telecommunication firms and partners of AST have also told the FCC they’ll sue if SpaceX receives the necessary waiver to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond the normal limits. AST is now taking a more vocal role in the dispute. In Thursday’s letter to the FCC, the company said it supported the mobile carriers' "legitimate" interference concerns about cellular Starlink technology operating beyond the normal radio emission limits. "AST SpaceMobile’s position is simple: SCS [supplemental coverage from space] providers should be allowed to operate as long as they avoid causing harmful interference to the cellular networks on which billions of people rely globally,” the company said. In the same letter, AST also alleged that SpaceX’s lobbying efforts to the FCC are a “thinly veiled attempt to deflect the technical shortcomings of its own design and its inability to effectively share terrestrial spectrum.” However, SpaceX has long maintained its request to increase the radio emission limits for the cellular Starlink technology won’t generate radio interference, citing its own analysis.

Title: Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett: Splitting up America’s leading chipmaker is a bad idea
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/25/former-intel-ceo-craig-barrett-splitting-up-america-leading-chipmaker-bad-idea-semiconductors-tech-finance/
Time Published: 2024-10-25T14:33:08Z
Full Content:
Throughout the 59-year history of Moore’s Law, the only consistent truth in the semiconductor industry has been that performance wins. Competitors come and go, and new technologies like PCs, smartphones, and artificial intelligence rapidly change the landscape. But in the end, the company with the best technology and ability to manufacture in high volume wins the prize. For decades, this was Intel. The company’s mantra was to drive technology leadership at all costs and push Moore’s Law to the limit. That’s how Intel became the most successful semiconductor company on the planet, with manufacturing technology consistently one generation (about two years) ahead of everyone else. During the last decade, this all changed. Intel stumbled and lost its leadership position—and now it’s viewed by some as just another company struggling to survive. Some pundits think there is a simple solution: split the company into two. That way, their argument goes, the Intel design company can compete with other chip designers (AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, etc.) while the foundry part of the company can be free to serve all chip designers. This simplistic solution ignores the existence of Moore’s Law—and would be bad for Intel and the United States. Every design company wants the best manufacturing technology available so as to maximize the performance of its chips. This holds true for companies that sell chips on the open market as well as those that design for the internal use of the likes of Apple and Amazon. Whichever foundry has the latest and greatest technology will win the lion’s share of all the chip designer’s business. Today, that position is held by TSMC. Much of the industry relies on the same manufacturer to build their products—their only manufacturing advantage is TSMC’s technology leadership. Intel can attract these same chip customers by restoring its foundry technology leadership. Even if you compete with Intel designs, why put yourself at a disadvantage? As long as Intel has the best technology and is competitive on price, competitive issues can be resolved. This is all unfolding at a time when the world needs a more globally diverse and resilient semiconductor supply chain. Geopolitical tensions around the world are escalating, making the urgent need for having a strong U.S. manufacturing capability on our own shores even more pressing. Splitting Intel into two separate companies wouldn’t do the U.S. any good if the Intel design business succeeds and the foundry business does not. In that case, the U.S. would remain dependent on a foreign supplier for leading-edge technology—and the $50 billion in the CHIPS ACT would have been wasted. We’ve seen this movie before. Years ago, a struggling AMD split off its manufacturing capacity into Global Foundries. Pundits applauded the split at the time. A decade later, AMD is doing well using TSMC, while Global Foundries has little if any differentiated technology. Global Foundries just didn’t have enough research and development (R&D) budget, and with limited production and revenue, struggled to keep up with market leaders. The economic reality is that it takes massive investment to drive Moore’s Law. In today’s semiconductor industry, only three companies (Intel, Samsung, and TSMC) have sufficient revenue to contend for technology leadership. If you split up Intel, the foundry portion will probably fail because of decreased R&D spending along with the complex realities of splitting up a huge multinational company in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort. Instead of wasting time and effort splitting Intel into two separate companies, why not focus on the real issue? The Intel of tomorrow needs to be like the Intel of 15 years ago—the driver and leader of Moore’s Law. That way, you get a win-win scenario with U.S.-based design and manufacturing technology. This starts with rebuilding Intel’s technology leadership. The current CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has precisely the right strategy and attributes, and he is already driving the right changes. Intel is on the verge of completing an unprecedented pace of node development to catch up to TSMC. It has taken the lead on next-gen technologies that will shape the semiconductor industry for years to come, such as high NA EUV lithography and backside power delivery. Yes, more work is needed—but this is a good start, and they must keep going. The U.S. government must do its part as well. This includes increased funding of basic pre-competitive research in semiconductor technology in our research universities and national laboratories. The U.S. has made a small step in this direction with the creation of the National Semiconductor Technology Center, but there is still a ways to go, especially when you consider the NSTC budget for five years is less than what Intel spends annually on R&D. There are immense challenges as leading manufacturers race to create technologies that combine 100 billion transistors into a piece of silicon the size of a fingernail. These are the most complicated things mankind has ever built, and semiconductor leaders will spend tens of billions of dollars to make it happen. Let’s not kid ourselves: If the U.S. wants to be a leader in this game once again, simply slicing Intel in half is not the solution. We must be willing to invest and do the hard work of leading Moore’s Law into the future, not waste time rearranging the deck chairs. I remember a similar time in Intel’s history—the dot-com bubble crash of the early 2000s. Customer demand evaporated. Wall Street said we should have layoffs, close factories, and cut R&D spending. The Intel board agonized over the situation but followed management’s plan to maintain investment in R&D and build new factories. The stock price crashed, but when demand returned, Intel was in a stronger position than before. It wasn’t pretty but it was the right thing to do. Pat Gelsinger is doing the right thing now.

Title: Nasdaq Hits All-Time High—First Since July As Tesla Stock Leads Tech Rally
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/25/nasdaq-hits-all-time-high-first-since-july-as-tesla-stock-leads-tech-rally/

The Nasdaq Composite jumped to an all-time high Friday, a first for the tech-heavy stock index in more than three months as the group shook off tailwinds such as rising bond yields and enjoyed a boost from Tesla’s share price. A new tech stock high was set Friday. The Nasdaq rose as much as 1.5% to a new record of 18.690.01, surpassing the previous high set July 11. Predictably leading the way for the Nasdaq were the “magnificent seven” behemoths, with Amazon, Facebook parent Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla stocks all rising at least 1.5% by midmorning, with Tesla’s near 3% gain leading the group and Apple stock’s 0.7% advance trailing those of its peers. The less tech-exposed S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes rose 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively, short of their all-time highs set last week. 25%. That’s how much shares of the electric vehicle giant Tesla are up since Wednesday, as its third-quarter earnings report impressed investors. The Nasdaq was much harder-hit by this summer’s economic growth scare selloff than the more industry-neutral Dow and S&P, as the Nasdaq fell into a more than 10% correction in August as the market sold off on tech companies thought to be more sensitive to a potential recession. But data over the last two months have shown little signs of an economic slowdown, helping restore faith in the earnings growth trajectory necessary to justify the Nasdaq’s more than 70% gain over the last two years. Much of that rally is tied to investor excitement over the profit potential for tech companies stemming from the exploding interest in artificial intelligence. Nvidia, which is the primary architect of the semiconductor technology powering generative AI, is the poster child of this rally, growing its market capitalization from less than $300 billion in Oct. 2022 to $3.5 trillion Friday. Tech stocks will face several tests next week as major third-quarter results come in. Alphabet, Amazon Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Uber are among the companies whose earnings reports will out between next Tuesday and Thursday. One Community. Many Voices.

Yesterday's hit stock has cooled a bit today—but it's still working its way higher. Shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA) were up nearly 3% in early trading Friday to around $268, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500. (Read today's markets coverage here.) That's less dramatic than the numbers the stock turned in Thursday as the company saw its shares rise 22%, its biggest percentage gain in more than a decade, on the back of an earnings report and outlook investors cheered. Today's move has the stock on track for a weekly gain of about 21% from last Friday's close of $220.70. It has the company's market capitalization at around $840 billion, according to Visible Alpha data. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have yet to catch up to Tesla's latest ride higher, with their mean price target at about $232. It also comes as the other six of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap tech shares—Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA)—rose, with all but Apple up more than 1% in recent trading. That would point toward general optimism ahead of quarterly financial results from Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta that are expected next week.

Title: ‘Money in Exchange for Silence’: Behind Neom’s Green Image, Western Firms Cash in on Saudi Commitment to Oil

Lambert here: Strong original reporting from DeSmog. Every so often, Saudi propaganda for Neom comes across my feed, and it’s obviously a grandiose real estate development signaling some sort of horrid end state; the very last thing the Saudi people need is an indoor ski resort. But I didn’t realize how grandiose. Ka-ching ka-ching. By Adam M. Lowenstein, a freelance journalist and writer covering the climate crisis, capitalism, and corporate power. A former Capitol Hill aide and U.S. Senate speechwriter, his work has also appeared in The Atlantic, The Guardian, The American Prospect, The Lever, and other publications. Originally published at DeSmog. The video opens with the voice of a child. “Since the beginning, we’ve changed things,” she says. “It’s in our genes. It’s what makes us human.” The viewer zooms through stages in human development — agriculture, science, air travel, space flight. A dramatic musical score rises steadily in volume. “Now, we have a chance to change everything,” the narrator intones, as the camera comes to rest on a blank canvas. After a beat, water explodes across the screen, soaking the frame. “Let’s change water,” she says, “so it flows forever. Energy, so it powers our lives sustainably.” From climate change and food security to aging and mobility, the video proceeds topic by topic, issuing an inspiring call to action — one seen more than 22 million times on YouTube, and by countless others on massive screens in New York City’s Times Square. “This is where we can change it all,” the narrator intones. “Neom,” she concludes, is “made to change.” “Neom” is the brainchild and flagship construction project of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the ruler-in-waiting and de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. Designed hand-in-hand with elite Western consulting firms McKinsey & Company, Oliver Wyman, and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and named for a combination of “neo” and “mustaqbal” — the Greek and Arabic words for “new” and “future” — Neom is portrayed as a futuristic, emissions-free utopia in the country’s northwest Tabuk province, which sits along the coast of the Red Sea. The mega-development is chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed and owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s $900 billion sovereign wealth fund, which the crown prince also chairs. As the “made to change” video suggests, Neom’s promotional efforts often consist of fanciful digital renderings of luxurious resorts and futuristic cityscapes replete with lush greenery, vibrant natural wonders, and promises of ecological and environmental preservation. “Sustainability is a very big theme in everything that we do,” Rayan Fayez, Neom’s deputy CEO, told an audience in Rio de Janeiro in June. Fayez was addressing an event organized by the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute, a PIF-led nonprofit that convenes investors and global power players in cities around the world. Some of America’s wealthiest investors and chief executives will be speaking at this year’s flagship FII gathering known as “Davos in the Desert” — which will take place in the Saudi capital of Riyadh from October 29-31 — including Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google; Stephen Schwarzman, the head of the private equity giant Blackstone; and Larry Fink, CEO of the asset manager BlackRock. The FII Institute counts Neom as a “strategic partner.” Paradoxically for a project cloaked in green branding, Neom — or at least the idea of Neom — has emerged as an important asset in the Saudi government’s campaign to preserve global demand for fossil fuels. “Mohammed bin Salman wants to be part of this … global concern with the climate,” said Madawi Al-Rasheed, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics (LSE) Middle East Centre. “But also, let’s not forget that the [Saudi] economy is based on oil, and this is one of the most polluting industries that you can imagine. … The whole country’s based on an oil company. They have to show that they’re diversifying, investing in other things.” This dilemma has made Neom a core plank in Crown Prince Mohammed’s plan for the future of Saudi Arabia. Known as “Vision 2030,” the McKinsey–conceived roadmap ostensibly charts a course for the country to open itself to the world — primarily through tourism and foreign investment — while reducing its dependence on oil. Key to this transformation is an aggressive rebrand of the kingdom as a leader in the global fight against climate change. It is a delicate challenge to portray the world’s largest oil exporter — and a documented opponent of global climate action, particularly at UN climate talks — as a champion of sustainability. But it is not a challenge that the Saudi government is attempting alone. DeSmog found that at least two-dozen communications firms mentioned in this story — including agencies specializing in PR, consulting, advertising, and video and graphic design — have together earned tens of millions of dollars helping Crown Prince Mohammed and the Saudi government develop and sell the idea of Neom. To build up a picture of these companies’ activities, DeSmog reviewed hundreds of internal company documents; industry award submissions and press releases; social media posts and case studies published by staff and executives at Neom and many of the individual firms; as well as thousands of pages of documents filed with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). (The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires American companies who advocate or lobby for foreign governments to disclose information about those activities, as well as the names of the employees involved in them, to the DOJ.) If Neom’s marketing materials are to be believed, the city will soon offer a globally integrated, carbon-free home for billions of dollars’ worth of investor capital and millions of people from around the world, thanks to engineering and urban development marvels like The Line, a 170-kilometer-long, 500-meter-tall city “powered by 100 percent clean energy,” and Trojena, a mountainous region that promises to deploy cloud seeding to create an outdoor ski resort in the desert. The Line provides “a blueprint for how people and planet can co-exist in harmony,” says a Neom press release distributed by Chicago-headquartered Edelman, one of the largest PR agencies in the world. Trojena, which is scheduled to host the Asian Winter Games in 2029, “confirms our commitment to be part of the global effort to protect the environment,” Crown Prince Mohammed says in another release, this one distributed by the New York City-based communications firm Teneo. In fact, all of Neom’s regions and projects “will be aligned in their respect for the environment and achieving balance, because Neom’s ambitious vision seeks to shape the future in which living and working are integrated in a sustainable way,” Teneo’s release says. Edelman distributed this press release and graphic in early 2021 as part of its promotion of The Line. Edelman included the image with a Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filing to the U.S. Department of Justice. Experts told DeSmog that whether or not Neom is ever built, the reward for the Saudi government of involving so many prestigious firms goes beyond branding the country as green and legitimizing the crown prince’s hold on power. The scale of Western entanglement creates a financial dependence on Saudi largesse that makes it more difficult for these firms to disengage from Saudi Arabia — or for business leaders and government officials to speak out publicly — because of the Saudi state’s human rights abuses, its repression of civil and political liberties, or its efforts to obstruct global climate negotiations. Following the October 2018 abduction and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi — an operation that Crown Prince Mohammed “approved,” according to a U.S. intelligence assessment — Western elites’ shunning of the kingdom ultimately proved as fleeting as their governments’ promises to isolate the crown prince. But the outcry, while short-lived, nonetheless served as a wake-up call for the crown prince and his allies, experts said, particularly as the government has faced criticism over allegations of forcibly evicting residents of the Tabuk province to make space for Neom. “What they want is to create a substantial Western interest and personnel in Saudi Arabia in order to make Saudi Arabia defended by Western interests, should Saudi Arabia need that,” said LSE’s Madawi Al-Rasheed. “If you have a big population of Westerners in a country … then it becomes like a satellite state that has to be protected because Western interests are really intertwined with the local economy, and you can’t just abandon your people.” The crown prince is “thinking about alternative ways of keeping Western interests alive in Saudi Arabia,” Al-Rasheed said. “These projects, these consultancy firms, the PR companies are all meant to create that bondage — an alternative to just one commodity, and that is oil.” I. A ‘Golden Cash Cow’: Elite Agencies Capitalize on Neom According to the documents reviewed by DeSmog, the list of firms that have signed contracts with Neom includes some of the world’s biggest marketing, advertising, and communications conglomerates and their subsidiaries, such as: Independent agencies, such as Edelman, Teneo, KARV (formerly KARV Communications), Ruder Finn, and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck have together won millions of dollars’ worth of additional work for Neom, as have countless smaller creative agencies, many headquartered in New York City and London. This list of companies working to shape Neom’s image, which is not comprehensive, omits many of the lobbying and public affairs firms that work to shape the Saudis’ reputation in Washington, DC and other capitals. It also omits the 23 architecture studios shaping the city’s actual construction, according to a tally compiled by the architecture publication Dezeen. Other U.S.-based companies, including FleishmanHillard and Prosek Partners, have been hired by the FII Institute, which frequently promotes Neom at its events. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the head of the PIF and the chairman of the board of Saudi Aramco, the country’s state-run oil giant, also serves as chairman of the FII Institute. (There is no indication that FleishmanHillard, which is part of Omnicom, or Prosek Partners have worked for Neom directly.) The FII Institute is run by Richard Attias, a former Publicis Groupe executive and longtime producer of the World Economic Forum (WEF), an annual gathering for global elites in Davos, Switzerland. These days Attias, who has close ties to the Saudi royal family, and his communications firm, Richard Attias & Associates, are largely known for hosting the FII’s “Davos in the Desert” in Riyadh. (The crown prince publicly launched Neom at the gathering in 2017.) Beyond the FII, however, Attias and his company have also done significant work for Neom, including organizing “Discover Neom” tours to solicit foreign investment in cities ranging from Boston and Miami to Berlin, Paris, and Seoul, according to news reports and social media posts. The PR agency KARV’s work for Neom, which remains ongoing, is also run through Attias’s company. A spokesperson for the office of Richard Attias told DeSmog in an email that Richard Attias & Associates “is a global strategic communications and events firm that works with more than 50 clients worldwide annually, including Neom. We have provided events services for the Discover Neom Roadshows from 2022 to 2023, and communications advisory since 2023.” The FII Institute, the spokesperson said, “counts more than 30 international and regional entities as strategic partners, and Neom is indeed one of them.” * * * DeSmog’s findings suggest that many PR and consulting companies have anchored themselves in the lucrative ecosystem of Neom and the Saudi government, in part by capitalizing on Crown Prince Mohammed’s desire to be perceived as taking action on climate change. Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the nonprofit DAWN (Democracy for the Arab World Now), a Washington, DC-based nonprofit that was co-founded by Jamal Khashoggi, said the Saudi government is willing to spend vast amounts of money for purported Western expertise with little oversight. Put simply, Neom contracts are a “golden cash cow,” Whitson said. (One Neom-focused job opening in London, which was posted by a Publicis subsidiary, appealed to potential applicants by describing Neom as a client offering “unlimited content budgets.”) In conversations with DeSmog, a former employee of a sustainability-focused subsidiary of one of the world’s biggest communications conglomerates described witnessing an aggressive, even desperate, push to win a contract with Neom. The pitch, which eventually involved some of the conglomerate’s most senior executives, was for work to promote one of Neom’s widely touted environmental projects. The advertising agency’s history of working with clients seeking to advance their climate and environmental goals formed a key part of its appeal. The former employee, who requested to share their story anonymously for fear of professional repercussions, expressed concerns to executives within the agency that Neom could be largely a greenwashing exercise for a government funded by, and committed to, oil extraction. The former employee also cautioned that the firm, by doing this work for Neom, could contribute to sanitizing the Saudi government’s human rights record. When this employee shared their concerns internally, they were told that the agency’s participation in the pitch was vital because the agency had such a strong reputation for sustainability. After escalating concerns to more senior executives throughout the company, the former employee came to believe that they had been silenced and excluded from the project. Eventually, the employee chose to leave the company after concluding that their position was no longer tenable — and that their concerns about sustainability and human rights, despite featuring prominently in the company’s code of conduct, would continue to be ignored. As this employee’s experience suggests, for the Western creatives and communicators cashing in on Neom contracts, whether Neom’s flagship projects are actually green — or whether they are even ever likely to exist — appears to be of secondary importance to the task of portraying them that way. For these companies, “why not get in on the action? It’s easy money, with more to come,” said DAWN’s Sarah Leah Whitson. II. ‘A Blank Canvas’: Crafting a Convenient Narrative In response to a series of detailed questions, as well as requests for an interview and comments for this story, a spokesperson for Neom emailed a statement to DeSmog: “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2060. Neom is supporting that goal by investing in emerging green technologies, including hydrogen production at scale, such as the world’s largest hydrogen plant … We are also committed to making our developments net zero emission zones upon completion, as we continue to focus on leveraging 100 percent renewable energy sources with sun and wind being abundant in this region of Saudi Arabia. In the construction phase of our developments, we are focused on decarbonizing, with the integration of circular economy principles including the use of carbon capture and utilization technology in our cement manufacturing plants. “Sustainability is deeply woven into Neom’s ethos, values, business practices, and operations. One of our core commitments is to preserve 95 percent of Neom for nature. We are also regreening and rewilding native landscapes as part of our Neom Nature Reserve. Five native species have already been reintroduced to two native habitat zones, and more than three million trees, shrubs, and grasses have been planted across 750 hectares as part of our program to restore extensive natural habitats with 100 million native plants.” In addition to Neom, as part of this investigation DeSmog contacted the firms mentioned in the story to request interviews and comments about their work for Neom. DeSmog also submitted a comment request to the Saudi embassy in Washington, DC. Most firms either declined to comment or did not respond. The embassy also did not respond. In order to work for the Saudi government, many companies agree to aggressive confidentiality and nondisclosure terms. Earlier this year, for instance, McKinsey, Teneo, M. Klein & Company, and BCG defied a subpoena from the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which was examining the Saudi government’s efforts to influence U.S. policy through tactics such as “sportswashing,” telling senators that Saudi officials would not allow them to discuss their work. “It’s simply staggering to me that American companies are not only willing to accept this claim, allowing the Saudi government to determine what is permitted to provide this subcommittee, but also that they would use it to justify their refusal to comply with a duly-issued congressional subpoena,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, the chairman of the subcommittee, said in a prepared statement for a February hearing with executives of the four firms. Despite these strident nondisclosure terms, however, some companies have been more vocal about their work for Neom on their websites and on social media. “From introducing a new model for urban sustainability powered by 100 percent renewable energy to creating hyper-connected communities centered around nature, not roads — [Neom’s] ‘living laboratories’ will embrace technology and innovation at scale to enhance liveability and answer some of humanity’s most urgent challenges,” McCann Enterprise wrote in a case study about its role in Neom’s “made to change” video. “Designed to inspire, it offers a tantalizing glimpse of what the future could look like.” Slides from The Story of NEOM, an internal document created for Neom by McCann Worldgroup. “Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do,” the presentation stated. McCann Enterprise is part of the global network McCann Worldgroup, which itself is the creator of a 168-slide presentation titled “THE STORY OF NEOM.” This internal document, which was obtained by DeSmog, features detailed overviews of Neom’s regions and provides promotional language and graphics that have appeared repeatedly across Neom’s website, social media activity, videos, and other materials. The words “sustainable” and “sustainability” together appear 58 times throughout the document. McCann Worldgroup declined to comment. “Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do,” the presentation states — a message McCann Enterprise has carried forth in much of its work for Neom. In the case study about the “made to change” video (part of what the agency called a “spectacular” campaign), McCann Enterprise described Neom as “a place designed to concentrate and accelerate the human drive for progress.” The city, the company said, is “a blank canvas for a new era of sustainable living.” “The creative idea from McCann London positions Neom as a change-maker that will inspire the world as it reimagines a healthier, more responsible, efficient, sustainable, and balanced way of life, starting from a blank canvas,” echoes a LinkedIn post by Joy Films, a production company that worked on the “made to change” video and has been involved in promoting numerous Neom projects. The “blank canvas” narrative is one that the Saudi government has promoted eagerly. “Since we have [an] empty place, and we want to have a place for 10 million people, then let’s think from scratch,” Crown Prince Mohammed said in a 2023 documentary about The Line on Discovery UK. The “blank canvas” in Neom’s “made to change” video. “Now, we have a chance to change everything,” says the narrator, as water explodes across the screen and drenches the canvas. But the Tabuk province in northwest Saudi Arabia, where pieces of Neom are slowly being built, was neither blank nor empty before it was claimed for the city’s construction. The land’s longtime residents include members of the Huwaitat tribe, who the Saudi government began forcibly evicting at the beginning of 2020, according to a report from the international nonprofit ALQST for Human Rights. The tribal community, whose members had lived for centuries in what Western creative agencies repeatedly portray as empty, “was terrorized into submission,” DAWN’s Sarah Leah Whitson told DeSmog. “[We] haven’t heard a peep from them since.” ALQST has documented that at least 15 Huwaitat people who opposed being displaced for Neom’s “blank canvas” have been sentenced “to prison terms of between 15 and 50 years.” Another five have been sentenced to death. In 2020 Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti, a prominent Huwaitat protestor, was killed by Saudi special forces in his home. Earlier this year a former Saudi intelligence official told the BBC that the government had “licensed the use of lethal force against whoever stayed in their home.” The forced eviction of the Huwaitat tribe and the death of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti have not captured global attention in the same way as the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. But these developments have nevertheless been widely reported in the media and publicized by human rights advocates. In May 2023, a group of independent experts appointed by the UN warned that three members of the Huwaitat tribe were facing “imminent execution” for opposing their eviction for The Line. “We urge all companies involved, including foreign investors, to ensure that they are not causing or contributing to, and are not directly linked to, serious human rights abuses,” the UN experts wrote. A handful of companies have proven willing to walk away from Saudi contracts. In July 2018, Gladstone Place Partners, an independent New York City-based communications firm, signed a nearly $200,000 agreement to promote Neom in U.S. markets and introduce the city’s CEO to Fortune magazine and other “top-tier media.” Gladstone terminated the contract shortly after Khashoggi’s disappearance. More recently, Malcolm Aw, the CEO of the renewable energy firm Solar Water, told Business Insider that he scrapped a $100 million contract with Neom to build solar-powered water desalination plants in the city after learning of the government’s aggressive eviction of the Huwaitat people. But rather than walking away, most Western companies doing business with Neom appear to have chosen the more lucrative path of looking the other way, a pattern that appears likely to continue. “Spreading such large amounts of capital … through such a broad spectrum of elite American companies precludes that kind of blowback from happening again,” said DAWN’s Sarah Leah Whitson, referring to the global backlash that followed Khashoggi’s murder in 2018. In fact, the Saudi government’s explicit commitment to extracting fossil fuels and obstructing global climate diplomacy, as well as its human rights abuses, ongoing political repression, and intolerance of dissent — such as decades-long prison terms for social media posts critical of Neom or the government itself — seem only to have created more demand for elite reputation cleansing. One PR industry award framed that challenge as an opportunity: “The global sentiment around Neom … was one rooted in cynicism and confusion rather than excitement.” III. ‘What is Neom?’: A Sprawling Web of Contracts In 2023, the year after it painted Neom as “made to change,” McCann Enterprise returned for another piece of work, this time to present Google searchers, YouTube streamers, and social media scrollers with the question of “what is Neom?” — and then align their answers with a Neom-approved narrative. As it had during the “made to change” campaign, the London agency teamed up with Monks, a “digital operating brand” of S4Capital, an advertising and marketing company founded by Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and former head of the global conglomerate WPP. (Neom is “one of the most visionary, ambitious, thrilling, and motivating projects I have ever seen,” Sir Martin wrote of “made to change.”) Monks referred DeSmog to its statement on modern slavery and its code of conduct. Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and former head of the global conglomerate WPP, posted to his LinkedIn account in December 2021 that Neom was “one of the most visionary, ambitious, thrilling, and motivating projects I have ever seen.” Additional contributors to the new campaign included Google; Mathematic, a Paris-headquartered design studio that had also worked on videos for Trojena; Whisper, a UK-based production company; and Starcom, Leo Burnett, and Saatchi & Saatchi – all subsidiaries of the French holding group Publicis. Whisper and McCann Enterprise had previously collaborated on videos for Tonomus, Neom’s so-called “hyperconnected cognitive city,” which both Edelman and the DC lobbying shop Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck have also helped promote. “What is Neom?” featured a particularly close partnership between Neom and Google Creative Works, an operation within the tech giant that helps companies monetize Google users’ data and attention. According to a February 2024 case study written by a former Neom marketing executive and published by Google, “what is Neom?” sought to use detailed tracking and targeting of browsing behavior by Google search and YouTube users to change how viewers thought about Neom. The campaign’s entry point was a series of “15-second teaser video ads” on YouTube and other platforms. If viewers engaged with the teaser videos, they were then “automatically shown” a longer video that “used simple, conversational language to demystify the complexity of the Neom project, which was critical to the campaign’s storytelling element,” the case study said. Many of the videos emphasized Neom’s environmental claims. Neom is “an entirely new model for sustainable living,” stated one video. “Call it what you want, but it’s a place that’s going to change the way we live on this planet,” said another. Parts of two industry award submissions by Monks (top) and McCann Enterprise (bottom) for their work on the “What Is Neom?” campaign. Creating the campaign involved “an incredibly fast turnaround shoot that spanned the globe,” said one Whisper employee in an interview published on LinkedIn. “A real feat of impressive logistics delivered by the team!” For McCann Enterprise’s part, the “what is Neom?” videos involved a team of at least 14 employees, according to a celebratory LinkedIn post by the company’s chief creative officer. “Exaggerated and negative commentary overwhelms the media and online landscape, drowning out credible information about many topics including Neom,” McCann Enterprise wrote in a separate case study. “We needed to bring the truth to the front page. And today’s front page is the Google results page.” According to McCann Enterprise, for the 2023 project it hired Ipsos, a survey firm, in part to track Neom’s “brand health.” In May, a few months after “what is Neom?” launched, some journalists opened their inboxes to find that they were being asked to fill out an “Ipsos Survey for Neom.” The request came from KARV, the independent PR agency based in New York City. (It is unclear whether the Ipsos survey distributed by KARV is the same one referenced in the McCann Enterprise case study.) Earlier that year, KARV had signed a $980,000 contract to provide “Neom leadership” with “strategic communications and media relations,” including “strategic positioning counsel” and “messaging and editorial support,” via Richard Attias & Associates. This wasn’t KARV’s first time doing business with the Saudi government. In February 2019, barely four months after Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance, KARV head Andrew Frank personally signed a contract with the PIF. Crown Prince Mohammed’s position as chair of the investment fund means it is effectively controlled by him. The PIF “is just MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] himself,” Abdullah Alaoudh, the senior director for countering authoritarianism at the DC-based Middle East Democracy Center, told DeSmog. “I don’t know why they call it [a] sovereign wealth fund. It’s just MBS’s wealth fund, basically.” (KARV’s work for the PIF would eventually bring in more than $3 million.) A portion of KARV Communications’ contract with the Public Investment Fund. KARV’s CEO personally signed the contract in February 2019, barely four months after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by Saudi government agents. In a statement emailed to DeSmog, a KARV spokesperson said, “KARV works in conjunction with Richard Attias & Associates in providing strategic communications, messaging, and media relations support to Neom as it aims to address the world’s greatest challenges through advancements in healthcare, education, economic opportunity, and sustainability.” * * * Among the numerous projects that “what is Neom?” sought to introduce to the world was Trojena, Neom’s ski resort and one of its most heavily promoted endeavors. In fact, another arm of McCann Worldgroup had already been involved in Trojena: In early 2022, around the same time that McCann Enterprise was portraying Neom as “made to change,” the U.S.-based McCann New York had been gearing up to help launch the mountain resort. Trojena, according to the “STORY OF NEOM” internal branding document created by McCann Worldgroup and obtained by DeSmog, will house “The Vault,” a “folding village” and “vertical city inside of a mountain with its own microclimate,” as well as “the first outdoor ski resort in Saudi Arabia” with “30 km of planned ski slopes.” Slides about Trojena from McCann Worldgroup’s internal branding document, The Story of Neom. To bring this implausible-sounding concept to life, McCann New York worked with Joy Films — which was also involved in the “made to change” and “what is Neom?” campaigns — to create a video portraying a group of skiers and snowboarders racing uphill in the snow, through an avalanche, before shooting into the sky under the slogan, “journey to new heights.” The video has racked up more than 17 million views on YouTube, though experts cautioned that these numbers are to be interpreted with some skepticism, given the Saudi government’s record of using bots and troll farms to boost social media numbers and harass critics. Neom also took the companies’ work beyond social media. With the help of Pixel Artworks, a UK-based “immersive experience” company, Neom splashed the agencies’ Trojena imagery across huge moving billboards in Riyadh, Times Square, and London’s Piccadilly Circus. On LinkedIn, Neom touted its massive Times Square billboards promoting Trojena in this April 13, 2022 post. A wide array of firms, including Teneo, McCann New York, Pixel Artworks, Joy Films, Squint/Opera, and KARV, are among the firms that have been paid by Neom to promote Trojena. This campaign put Neom’s commitment to sustainability front and center. Sometimes the message was implicit: Winter sports, by definition, require water and cold temperatures. Other times, the agencies were more direct. “Trojena will redefine mountain tourism for the world by creating a place based on the principles of ecotourism, highlighting our efforts to preserve nature and enhance the community’s quality of life,” read one unattributed quote included in a case study published by Squint/Opera, a UK-based creative shop owned by the U.S. agency Journey. The same quote was also attributed to Crown Prince Mohammed in a press release — distributed by Teneo — that accompanied Trojena’s launch. The release also quoted Nadhmi Al-Nasr, Neom’s CEO, describing Trojena as “a major contribution to achieving Neom’s long-term ambitions by adhering to the principles of sustainability.” Pixel Artworks, Joy Films, and Squint/Opera have each won other contracts with Neom. All three, for instance, have promoted The Line; Pixel Artworks says its video about the hypothetical horizontal city has generated more than 157 million YouTube views. And many continue to generate revenue from Neom. In March, Joy Films posted a video on Instagram about its ongoing work for Elanan, Neom’s “unique wellness retreat embedded in nature.” (KARV and Teneo have also promoted Elanan.) Whether projects like Elanan, Trojena, and The Line actually come to life or remain in the digital realm of slide decks and social media promises, the image of Neom — and the sprawling, interconnected web of contracts that helps create that image — serves an important function for the Saudi government. “I think what happened with Neom is that there’s so much money at stake that … what it managed to do is to buy people’s silence, including companies and states,” Lina Alhathloul, the head of monitoring and advocacy for ALQST, told DeSmog. Alhathloul’s sister, Loujain, an activist for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia, was jailed by the government for more than three years and is still banned from leaving the country. “Everyone [is] accepting Saudi money in exchange for silence,” Lina Alhathloul said. IV. ‘Hydrocarbons…for Many, Many Decades to Come’: A Kingdom Committed to Oil In January 2024, Neom invited investors, politicians, corporate executives, and other attendees of the World Economic Forum in Davos to drop by “Neom House,” a pop-up space branded with Neom’s logo and emblazoned with environmental imagery. Some of the building’s walls appeared to be covered in greenery. A nearly floor-to-ceiling graphic described Neom as “redefining the circular economy” and “powered by 100 percent clean energy.” Interactive screens showed visitors how Neom would “redefine livability, business, and conservation,” Neom later said. A look inside “Neom house” at the World Economic Forum in 2024. Source: Neom’s YouTube channel. Throughout the week, Neom House, which was designed in part by the same Pixel Artworks that had done work for Trojena and The Line, hosted a series of conversations about the city’s progress and potential. Many of these events seemed designed to create the image of a government leading the fight for global climate action. (Among those touting the promise of Neom to investors was Eric Cantor, the former majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives.) Despite the green imagery and messaging surrounding the events, some officials who spoke at Neom House offered a different take on the government’s climate agenda. During a discussion about “mitigation through proactive action,” Adel Al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs — and, since 2022, the country’s climate envoy — told the audience, “We want to be a realistic partner, and we want the world to be realistic,” employing a common rhetorical tactic of Saudi officials to caricature calls for the phase-out of fossil fuels as naïve or a “fantasy.” “We are saying that hydrocarbons will be the main source of energy for the world for many, many decades to come,” Al-Jubeir said. Flanked by a banner reading “Redefining Life for People and Planet,” Saudi climate envoy Adel Al-Jubeir (left) told Neom deputy CEO Rayan Fayez (right) that the Saudi government believed in “hydrocarbons… for many, many decades to come,” at a talk held in “NEOM house” during the 2024 World Economic Forum. Source: Neom’s YouTube channel. Saudi Arabia is the biggest exporter of oil in the world. Nearly two-thirds of government revenues stem from oil. Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil giant valued at around $2 trillion, is one of the world’s most valuable and most profitable companies. The kingdom controls around 82 percent of Aramco; the PIF, which owns Neom, also owns around 16 percent of Aramco — a stake worth around $160 billion. (McCann Worldgroup, Hill & Knowlton, Publicis, BCW, IPG, Mathematic, and FleishmanHillard are among the Western advertising and PR firms named in this story that have also worked for Aramco. The oil giant has also spent millions of dollars on sponsored content deals with the in-house creative studios of Western media outlets, including the New York Times, Financial Times and Reuters, in recent years, according to previous reporting by DeSmog and Drilled). “We’re trying to redefine how businesses coexist with nature,” Rayan Fayez, Neom’s deputy CEO, told Richard Attias at a 2023 FII Institute event. “Everything that we’re doing today at Neom has nature and environment at the core.” Yet the city’s construction is funded by oil sales, and the government’s entire operating model — including its investments in Neom and the crown prince’s other “giga-projects,” such as Diriyah, a $63 billion tourism development that will supposedly boast 38 hotels, and Jeddah Central, a waterfront project for which the Saudi government has also faced criticism for forcibly evicting local residents — depends on continuing to sell as much oil as possible, for as long as possible. “The crown prince [is] worried about all this talk about climate change and renewable energy — all of that creates tension in his mind because Saudi Arabia depends on selling oil,” LSE’s Madawi Al-Rasheed told DeSmog. “If oil becomes the ‘bad’ energy, then he’s stuck.” That’s why, even as Saudi policymakers work to reduce the kingdom’s own reliance on fossil fuels — an aim Neom might in fact support if its solar energy, desalination, “green” hydrogen, and other renewable energy projects come to fruition — the kingdom continues to work diligently to obstruct efforts that could reduce global demand for oil. In a 2008 paper, Cambridge University scholar Joanna Depledge summed up the Saudi government’s approach to international climate negotiations as “striving for no.” Thanks to its negotiators’ savvy tactics, including sowing disagreements among different countries, challenging established science about climate change, promoting false solutions to the crisis, and leveraging procedural rules and objections to stall discussions, “Saudi Arabia has been extremely successful in diverting the agenda and debates of the climate change government away from those issues it opposes, and towards those it supports,” Depledge argued. More than 15 years later, Depledge told DeSmog that what she wrote in that 2008 paper “nearly all still applies.” The Saudi government “has a thirty-year record of obstruction and delay, protecting its national oil and gas sector, and seeking to ensure UN climate talks achieve as little as possible, as slowly as possible,” Depledge and two co-authors wrote in 2023. “From Saudi Arabia’s perspective, ambitious global climate action is … more of a threat than climate change itself.” Last year the nonprofit Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) revealed the existence of a Saudi government effort, known as the Oil Demand Sustainability Program, which “aims to boost oil consumption across Asia and Africa, with the ultimate goal of protecting Saudi oil revenues from efforts to phase out fossil fuels,” CCR’s Lawrence Carter and Tom Costello wrote. At last year’s UN climate summit, meanwhile, Saudi negotiators “flatly opposed any language in a deal that would even mention fossil fuels,” the New York Times reported. (Saudi Arabia is reportedly one of a group of oil-dependent countries already working to make sure the upcoming UN summit in Azerbaijan does not call for a global phaseout of fossil fuels, according to the Financial Times.) While Saudi Arabia is far from the only country committed to obstructing and delaying climate action, its efforts have proven particularly successful and, as Depledge and her co-authors noted, provided cover for the United States other nations that benefit from continued fossil fuel production but would rather not be seen as spoilers. Then there’s the environmental impact of Neom itself. Despite the rhetoric and imagery pushed by the city and its Western consultants, experts and observers are skeptical that many of Neom’s projects can match their green hype. The Line, for instance, “will require a truly colossal quantity of materials, with emissions likely much higher than those produced in building a typical city,” predicted Philip Oldfield, a professor of architecture at the University of New South Wales in an opinion piece in the New York Times. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Neom was building multiple gas power plants “to power the region until greener energy is sourced.” “Trojena is a ski resort with fake snow. ‘Preserve the environment’ when you need to create new snow? It’s just not credible,” ALQST’s Lina Alhathloul told DeSmog. “The Line actually cuts the environment and removes all [of] the nature and all of the animals. It removes it completely.” Trojena and The Line are “the two most famous projects in Neom,” Alhathloul said, and “the two main projects are clearly not green.” V. ‘A Model for Sustainable Living’: Cashing in on the Idea of Neom While Western companies have been eager partners in portraying Trojena, The Line, and other Neom endeavors as green, many have proven equally adept at transforming their work for Neom into contracts with other parts of the Saudi government. In 2020, the independent agency Ruder Finn agreed to a $1.7 million deal to promote Neom’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, including by creating videos that “tell the story of CSR and its impact on the beneficiaries and the local community.” In the contract, Ruder Finn described itself as “a women-owned business with a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion.” Members of the LGBTQ community routinely face repression by the Saudi government. Lina Alhathloul’s sister, Loujain, remains one of numerous women’s rights activists in detention. “Saudi Arabia’s own record on women’s rights is abysmal,” Amnesty International’s Sherine Tadros told the Guardian. (Ruder Finn declined to comment.) Portions of Ruder Finn’s 2020 contract with Neom. A few years after wrapping up its work for Neom, Ruder Finn notified the DOJ that the firm had signed a contract with the country’s defense ministry to provide “strategic counsel, media relations, media monitoring, and content strategy and creation.” Kathy Bloomgarden, Ruder Finn’s CEO, personally registered with the DOJ to work on both contracts. Edelman, another independent firm that also began working for Neom in 2020, followed a similar path. According to DOJ filings, the company’s first contract with Neom, signed in November 2020, was expected to generate $75,000 a month for three months — a small sum for a firm that would bring in $840 million in revenue that year. Since then, however, Edelman has signed at least a dozen additional contracts and contract extensions with Neom and the Saudi government. Together these projects appear likely to generate more than $10.8 million for the firm, according to DeSmog’s analysis. As with Ruder Finn, Edelman’s work for Neom appears to have opened the door to work for other Saudi government agencies — and involved the firm’s most senior executive. In July 2022, Richard Edelman, Edelman’s CEO, hosted an invitation-only breakfast for Joseph Bradley, the head of Tonomus, one of Neom’s flagship projects. A few months later Richard Edelman registered with the DOJ as a foreign agent representing the Saudi culture ministry. The following year Richard Edelman hosted another “roundtable breakfast,” this time as part of the firm’s work promoting a “sustainable tourism” initiative for the Saudi tourism ministry. A July 8, 2022 invitation to a breakfast hosted by Richard Edelman for the CEO of Tonomous, one of Neom’s flagship projects. Edelman included the email in a FARA filing to the Justice Department. In response to a request for comment, Edelman referred DeSmog to its human rights policy and its public report on “citizenship.” In May 2023, Neom Green Hydrogen Company — a joint venture between Neom, Air Products, and ACWA Power, which itself is partly owned by the Saudi PIF — announced an $8.4 billion investment valuation for a “green” hydrogen plant located in Oxagon, a floating industrial development “powered by renewable energy.” (Edelman, Teneo, and Landor have also promoted Oxagon.) Hill & Knowlton, a U.S.-based firm, appears to have won industry awards for its work for Neom Green Hydrogen Company, including a campaign titled “Pioneering a green hydrogen future,” which won an industry award for “Best Campaign Demonstrating Environmental Initiatives.” Hill & Knowlton is listed as a media contact in an Air Products filing with the U.S. government. Earlier this year Hill & Knowlton merged with BCW to form Burson, which itself is part of London-headquarted WPP, one of the world’s largest communications conglomerates. According to federal filings, ASDA’A BCW, a subsidiary of BCW, signed its first contract with the Saudi government in January 2017, before linking up with Neom in the spring of 2020 for $390,000 worth of work. Burson is not the only WPP subsidiary to work for Neom. Landor (formerly Landor & Fitch) “worked through 24-hour shifts” to create Neom’s “brand idea and narrative,” according to a case study written by the company. Landor has been supporting Neom “since 2017,” one executive said last year, and has “many more Neom projects in the pipeline.” Landor Global posted to X on Nov. 18, 2021 about Oxagon, Neom’s floating industrial development “powered by renewable energy.” Edelman, Teneo, and Hill & Knowlton are among the other firms that have been paid to promote Oxagon. VI. ‘You Want to Maintain That Image’: Perception Is Reality The web of Western agencies’ involvement with the Saudi government can appear endless, likely with stronger and more numerous connections than will ever become public. Even so, one firm stands out for its success cashing in on the idea of Neom. According to federal filings with the DOJ, the strategy consulting firm Teneo began its work for Neom in May 2019, barely eight months after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. In an agreement worth more than $2 million, Teneo agreed to provide the city with messaging, communications, crisis response, and executive coaching. Both the contract and Teneo’s DOJ filings noted that Douglas Band, a former close aide to former U.S. president Bill Clinton and then president and co-founder of Teneo, would be personally involved in the work. (Band left the company in 2020.) Teneo’s early efforts were evidently to the Saudi government’s liking. Teneo agreed to another contract with Neom with an “effective date” of November 1, 2019 — shortly after many media outlets and human rights groups had marked the one-year anniversary of Khashoggi’s assassination at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and only weeks after Turkey’s government revealed transcripts of the journalist’s struggle with the Saudi hit squad sent to intercept him. (The assassins flew to and from Istanbul on planes owned by the PIF.) “You’ll suffocate me” were Khashoggi’s final words before his death. Excerpts from Teneo’s first contract with Neom. Teneo signed the contract in May 2019, barely eight months after Saudi government agents murdered Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in October 2018. In its federal filings about the $900,000 agreement, Teneo said it would “manage the Neom Communications Department” and “provide leadership of the department as well as staff resources to ensure the foreign principal’s corporate messages and positioning are effectively communicated.” The company’s responsibilities included preparing “a Crisis Preparedness capability for Neom,” according to the contract. Teneo signed two additional contracts with Neom in 2020, bringing in an additional $1.2 million. In August 2021, Teneo’s work for the Saudi government expanded beyond Neom when the firm agreed to work for the PIF. The same month Teneo signed another $3.3 million contract with Neom. Since 2022, Teneo has signed at least nine additional contracts and contract extensions with Neom, the PIF, and another entity created in part by the PIF (and 80 percent owned by it) that, in Teneo’s words, exists “to offer guidance and resourcing to support businesses and industry in the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] region as they play their part in the global transition to net zero.” All together, Teneo’s work for the kingdom appears to have been worth more than $30 million so far. “We are also establishing a model for sustainable living around the world,” said Al-Nasr, the Neom CEO, in a press release distributed by Teneo. * * * From Teneo to McCann to Google to Edelman, the web of prestigious and influential Western companies doing business with Neom and the Saudi government is vast and deeply interconnected — and impossible to map in full. This opacity stems from a powerful combination of aggressive nondisclosure agreements, strident corporate obfuscation, and an overwhelming torrent of marketing and PR imagery that blurs the boundary between what is real, and what exists only in digital simulations and science fiction-style YouTube videos. For both the Saudi government and its Western contractors, the distinction between the real and the imaginary appears irrelevant: The image of Neom as a sustainable city of the future is ultimately what matters. What is inescapably real, however, is the amount of money involved, and the growing demand among autocratic oil-producers for help revamping their reputations and selling a green image to domestic audiences and throughout Western capitals. This lucrative ecosystem extends well beyond the borders of Neom: In April, Teneo won a $4.2 million contract with the authoritarian government of Azerbaijan to handle communications for next month’s COP29 UN climate conference. “The whole point of this kind of dictatorship is [to] make believe that everything is so rosy and great,” said LSE’s Madawi Al-Rasheed. “And if you’re targeting partners such as the West — companies, global businesses, banks — then you don’t want them to hear about the bad side of the country. You want to maintain that image.” Additional reporting by TJ Jordan Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. I find it odd that people don’t question the narrative to Neom, particularly the people who try to point out the impossible aspects of the project, and that it might be a cover for something else like the Glomar Explorer was. I became more suspicious of this when I read a piece, in defense of the project, that stressed the project was possible because it was being built in “modular” form so the parts were not dependent on the whole. So you have different and discrete parts, with work going on underground, that will exist even if nobody ever moves in. If Saudi Arabia were working on it’s own nuclear program, or if they were putting some underground missile silos in place, the more outlandish the proposals the more it works to divert from what is going on – just as Glomar was aided by being linked to the “crazy” or “innovative” Howard Hughes. I don’t know if we have become so trained to fear being labeled a “conspiracy theorist” that we no longer admit governments do things in secret. The public was told about Glomar because of a break-in at some offices – contractors working on their part can be clueless to the whole project and real intent. I have never worried about the CT label, as I remind myself that Class is the main conspiracy. Something worth theorising about and even observing, perhaps judging! Patrick Boyle does a rather good takedown of the sheer nonsense of the projected project, though the gruesome monarchy’s (and its little helpers) activities are no laughing matter. I was just going to link to that! His humour is as dry the Saudi desert. He is slyly rigorous, remaining good natured. Cute as a fox, as my mother used to say. Interestingly, Saudi Arabia though quite rich as a country and able to afford to buy ample growth has had among the poorest growth records of any country these last 45 years.

Title: Big Tech goes nuclear: Amazon's pitch to use power plants shows the crucial role the energy source plays for AI

Happy Friday! Looking for a new way to jumpstart your mornings? (Besides reading this newsletter, of course.) Retired Navy SEAL Jocko Willink shared his daily routine that keeps the now-business owner focused. Speaking of new, we've got a cool tool for you to play around with: AI-powered search. We're using generative AI to help easily find all of our great stories. Check it out on our homepage. In today's big story, inside Amazon's internal pitch for turning to nuclear power to meet its growing energy needs. What's on deck: But first, let's power up. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. What's bigger than tech's ambitious plans for generative AI? The amount of energy needed to power it. That's led Big Tech to consider nuclear power to address its skyrocketing energy requirements. Business Insider's Eugene Kim has a report on how Amazon navigates its nuclear ambitions. In a signal of how serious Amazon is about going nuclear, the company pitched the energy source to CEO Andy Jassy this June, according to a company document he obtained. Since then, Amazon has led a $500 million financing round for a company developing modular nuclear reactors. It also agreed to purchase power from Talen Energy's nuclear-powered data center in March. And it's not alone. Microsoft and Google have invested in the sector, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman backed a nuclear reactor startup. The stakes are high for tech players to get energy. Eugene previously reported on how Amazon's dreams of building a data center empire face the realities of electricity, water, and labor constraints. Should those data center efforts continue to struggle, companies' big bets on generative AI could also falter. A tech-nuclear relationship is mutually beneficial. Tech companies need cost-efficient, reliable energy sources that won't increase their carbon footprint, writes BI's Hasan Chowdhury. Nuclear power ticks that box better than other clean energy options like solar or wind. Nuclear power, meanwhile, is an industry in desperate need of some love, BI's Daniel Geiger and Ellen Thomas previously reported. With at least one commercial nuclear plant closing every year since 2013, the sector has welcomed the interest. "We're seeing customers approach us at a rate that we haven't seen in my history with this industry," Jim Burke, CEO of nuclear owner Vistra, said back in March. Naturally, there are skeptics. A byproduct of nuclear power is radioactive waste. The transportation and storage of that remains a hot-button issue. High-profile incidents involving power plants like Chernobyl and Fukushima also drew criticism and stoked fears around the globe. Big Tech hasn't shied away from it. In September, Microsoft cut a deal with Constellation Energy to get power from part of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, home to the worst commercial nuclear accident in US history.

Title: Bitcoin Soars Towards $68K Amid Microsoft’s BTC Investment SEC Filing

Microsoft is preparing for a critical shareholder meeting on December 10, during which the future of Bitcoin as a potential investment will be a heated topic. At present, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $68,115, which represents an increase of approximately 1.22%. The rise in interest aligns with constant debates around the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge, which some Microsoft investors find appealing. Microsoft revealed in a recent application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it will propose evaluating Bitcoin investment during the forthcoming conference. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) says that Bitcoin has done better than traditional investments and could be a good way to protect against inflation. JUST IN: Per an SEC filing, Microsoft will have a proposed board resolution for an “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin”. The board is recommending that shareholders vote AGAINST the proposal. pic.twitter.com/0WveygitH9 — TFTC (@TFTC21) October 24, 2024 Microsoft’s board, on the other hand, wants shareholders to vote against this plan because the company has already looked at a wide range of investable assets, including cryptocurrencies. According to a spokesperson for the company: This emphasizes the careful strategy that Microsoft has adopted as far as the management of its corporate treasury is concerned as well as for the benefit of enhancing the shareholders value for the long term. The board is of the opinion that the requested public appraisal is unnecessary, as they already monitor trends and developments in the cryptocurrency sector. Microsoft’s major shareholders include a number of major institutional investors, such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These organizations own a large percentage of the company and have considerable power to affect its policy direction. Although some shareholders are advocating for Bitcoin investments, others may be more in line with the board’s cautious stance. It is important to note that BlackRock has been actively increasing its Bitcoin holdings through its ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has registered inflows to the tune of over $317 million in a 24-hour timeframe, according to recent reports. This trend implies that there is an increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin, despite Microsoft’s reluctance to implement comparable measures. As the December conference gets ready, the debate about Bitcoin’s importance in Microsoft’s investment plan gets more intense. The NCPPR argues that businesses should commit at least 1% of their whole assets to Bitcoin to help to reduce inflation risks. Despite this project, Microsoft insists that its present corporate treasury distribution policies are sufficient. Bitcoin has experienced a nearly twofold increase in value in the past year and has recorded a remarkable 414% increase over the past five years. Although Microsoft may not be completely prepared to invest in cryptocurrency investments at this time, the increasing interest from institutional investors such as BlackRock suggests that the discourse surrounding Bitcoin is far from over. Microsoft’s upcoming shareholder meeting will be the focus of all attention, and it is uncertain whether the tech giant will alter its position on cryptocurrencies or maintain its commitment to stability in its investment strategy.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Should you invest in growth stocks for capital gains through stock price appreciation or in dividend stocks for steady, reliable income? There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but patient investors are crushing it with income strategies, earning substantial returns through regular dividends. About two months ago, a dividend investor shared his success story and income report on r/Dividends – a community of over 600,000 members on Reddit. The investor, 48, said he was collecting about $2,200 per month in dividend income with a portfolio worth $378,351. This gives the portfolio a strong dividend yield of over 7%. Don’t Miss Out: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. The investor was asked about his expectations of capital growth from his portfolio. Here was his response: "I expect it to grow between 5-7% annually without reinvesting dividends. Yes, I am reinvesting dividends. With dividends reinvested, I expect it to grow 8-10% annually." Based on the screenshots shared by the investor publicly, let's examine some of the biggest holdings of this high-yield dividend portfolio. Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF: VFIAX) was one of the Redditor’s biggest positions, earning $2,200 per month in dividends. His portfolio screenshots showed that VFIAX accounted for about 34.5% of the entire portfolio. This fund tracks the S&P 500 Index, with about 79% of the portfolio comprising large-cap stocks. The fund yields 1.3% and pays quarterly dividends. Fidelity Total Bond K6 Fund Fidelity Total Bond K6 Fund (FTKFX) invests in U.S. government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other debt instruments. The fund suits investors looking for safer, fixed-income investments rather than stocks. FTKFX has a dividend yield of about 4.5% and pays monthly. About 32% of the investor’s total portfolio making $2,200 per month was invested in FTKFX. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF The Redditor, who earns about $2,200 in monthly dividend income on a $378,000 portfolio, had about 7.2% of his total investments in the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ). This covered call ETF distributes monthly dividend income. It invests in Nasdaq companies and generates extra income by selling call options. The fund has a dividend yield of more than 9%. NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF According to the portfolio screenshots shared publicly by the investor, about 6.7% of the $378,000 portfolio generating $2,200 in dividend income per month was allocated to the NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). SPYI is a high-yield covered call ETF that pays monthly dividend income. It invests in some of the top S&P 500 companies and generates extra income by selling call options on stocks, generating extra premium income for shareholders. SPYI has a distribution rate of more than 12%. Goldman Sachs Nasdaq-100 Core Premium Income ETF Goldman Sachs Nasdaq-100 Core Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:GPIQ) generates income by selling call options on stocks comprising the Nasdaq-100 Index. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Broadcom and Meta Platforms, among many top tech companies, form the fund’s biggest holdings. The Redditor making $2,200 monthly had 6.2% of his total portfolio allocated to the fund. Capital Group Dividend Value ETF Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) is another dividend-focused ETF in the portfolio of the Redditor, who makes $2,200 a month. The fund mostly invests in large-cap dividend-paying stocks. It pays quarterly dividends and is up 37% so far this year. Trending: The Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

The Simplify Volatility Premium ETF The Simplify Volatility Premium ETF (NYSE:SVOL) accounted for about 3% of the Redditor’s total portfolio, generating $2,200 in income per month. SVOL, which has a yield of about 16%, generates income by shorting the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) and betting that volatility will remain stable or decrease. Since the broader market tends to go higher in the long term, investing in this ETF suits those looking for stable income checks. Roundhill S&P 500 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF Roundhill S&P 500 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF (BATS:XDTE) generates income by selling call options on the S&P 500 Index that expire on the same day, known as 0DTE options. The ETF is suitable for those looking to generate short-term income by focusing on daily market movements. iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:SHY) tracks the performance of Treasury bonds with maturities between one and three years. Short-term bond ETFs like SHY are less vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations, providing stability to investors. The current interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through publicly-traded REITs. Arrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform, has launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. It paid 8.1% in July. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100. Looking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Buffett, Gates Weigh In (Updated)

Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 81 billionaires supporting Harris and 52 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: Ellison and Griffin are perhaps the most surprising billionaires who have stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering both have donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Griffin (Citadel) confirmed Thursday he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), while Griffin, the 39th-wealthiest, had been a Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) supporter. A total of 81 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: (Updated Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. A total of 52 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: (Updated Oct. 16) The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings. He gave another $43.6 million to a pro-Trump committee from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, becoming the second-most prolific donor in Trump’s camp this year, trailing only Adelson. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. (Updated Oct. 22): The New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. Tangent A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Lords committee warns about risks of the UK losing its EU data adequacy

mixmagic - stock.adobe.com British businesses and public sector organisations will face huge extra costs if the UK loses its ability to seamlessly transfer data to the European Union (EU), warns cross-party House of Lords committee. In June 2021, the European Commission granted “data adequacy” to the UK following its exit from the European Union (EU), allowing the free flow of personal data to and from the bloc to continue, but warned that the decision may yet be revoked if future data protection laws diverge significantly from those in Europe. In exiting the EU, the UK became a “third country” under the bloc’s rules, which means the European Commission (EC) will have to periodically assess whether it does provide an essentially equivalent level of data protection for EU citizens’ data. The EC will have to make two separate adequacy determinations under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Law Enforcement Directive (LED) – both of which were transposed into UK law via the current Data Protection Act 2018 – by the end of June 2025. Now, following a seven-month inquiry into the UK’s EU data adequacy, the European Affairs Committee (EAC) has written to digital secretary Peter Kyle urging the government to engage in early talks with the EC to ensure the UK maximises its prospects of achieving a data adequacy agreement in the first half of 2025. It also emphasised the that losing adequacy status could cause significant problems across a range of areas. This includes raising new barriers to international trade and economic cooperation, imposing significant extra costs and administrative burdens on organisations which share data between the UK and the EU (particularly in the context of policing and healthcare), and the risk of upending the Good Friday Agreement. The EAC also noted the high financial costs of losing adequacy, adding that while “compliance with GDPR can itself be costly, the loss of data adequacy would also lead to significant financial penalties for many organisations”. For example, the NHS Confederation and Understanding Patient Data estimated in a joint submission to the EAC that losing adequacy could cost the NHS alone tens of millions of pounds, while other estimates noted failing to secure adequacy status would impose additional compliance costs on UK businesses of £1 to £1.6bn. It added that adequacy was therefore valuable because it would reduce administrative burdens and compliance costs, increase legal certainty, and make the UK a more attractive location to invest and do business. “The UK faces a potential cliff-edge in June 2025 unless agreement is reached with the EU on the continued free flow of data. The safe and effective exchange of data underpins our trade and economic links with the EU and cooperation between our law-enforcement bodies,” said committee chair Lord Ricketts. “The loss of data adequacy would create new barriers and run completely counter to the government’s ambitions to grow the economy and reset relations with the EU. We recommend that reaching timely agreement on data adequacy should be integral to the reset, and the government’s top data protection priority.” To limit the uncertainty around its future adequacy status, the EAC recommended that the government “engages early with the European Commission and other EU stakeholders with a view to ensuring that the adequacy renewal process is on a positive track, and providing reassurance as soon as possible about the retention of adequacy status”. It added that the government should also explore the prospects for securing future adequacy renewal decisions from the European Commission which do not expire after a fixed period, and that it should engage with the EU in good time to explain and provide reassurances on any of its planned data protection reforms. “Since taking office, the science secretary has met EU commissioner Reynders twice to discuss the upcoming EU personal data adequacy review of the UK, and how to ensure secure continuity of personal data flows from the EU to the UK,” said a DSIT spokesperson in response to Computer Weekly’s request for comment on the EAC’s letter. “Our officials will join technical discussions with EU counterparts where required to support the review process.” The EAC’s letter noted although much of the evidence provided to its inquiry focused on the previous government’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (DPDI Bill) – which was dropped from the legislative agenda during the pre-general election “wash up” period – the new government’s planned Digital Information and Smart Data (DISD) Bill covers some of the same issues. The DISD was introduced to Parliament as the Data Use and Access (DUA) bill on 23 October 2024. Once passed, the DUA will therefore amend the UK’s implementation of both the GDPR and LED. While the EC’s adequacy decision will rest on the exact contents of DISD Bill (which was only published online on 24 October), it will be looking to assess whether the framework provides an essentially equivalent level of data protection for EU citizens’ data. This follows the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) striking down the EU-US Privacy Shield data-sharing agreement on 16 July 2020 for failing to ensure that European citizens had adequate rights of redress when data can be collected by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and other US intelligence services. The ruling – colloquially known as Schrems II after the Austrian lawyer who took the case to the CJEU – found that people must be given “essentially equivalent protection” for their data when it is transferred to the US and other countries as they would receive in the EU under the GDPR and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantees people the right for private communications and the protection of their private data. “The UK’s current GDPR regime is far from perfect. But the consequences of not reaching agreement with the EU are extremely harmful,” said Lord Ricketts. “There is clearly scope to reform and improve GDPR as part of the government’s new Digital Information and Smart Data Bill. But this must not jeopardise the UK’s adequacy status.” Lord Clement-Jones – a Liberal Democrat peer and spokesman for the digital economy in the House of Lords – added that the EAC’s letter “illustrates only too clearly the fragility of the UK’s data adequacy situation and the importance of resisting significant changes proposed by the last government to the UK GDPR”. Those previously suggested changes to the DPDI bill before it was dropped included removing the need to conduct data protection impact assessments and to have a data protection officer, loosening requirements around automated processing, and giving the secretary of state the power to directly appoint the information commissioner. In terms of the direct risks to data adequacy, the EAC said the UK faces “two distinct potential hurdles”, one being the EC’s renewal decision, and the potential of a legal case being brought against a positive renewal decision at the CJEU. It added that while the EC itself is likely to want to renew the UK’s adequacy status due to a range of factors – including the economic benefits it would bring the bloc, the fact the UK is using already GDPR as a starting point, and the EC’s own political and strategic imperatives – it was more likely the UK would lose adequacy as a result of a legal challenge being brought to the CJEU. “There was a large measure of consensus among our witnesses that, of the European Commission and the CJEU, the latter is the greater risk to the continuation of the UK’s adequacy status. For example, the not-for-profit technology organisation Reset called the CJEU ‘the more exacting forum of the two’ and said that the court ‘has in recent years consistently taken a more absolute line than the European Commission (and most of the Member States) in defence of fundamental privacy rights’,” it said. “Several witnesses pointed out that, in its two Schrems rulings, the CJEU had struck down previous EU adequacy arrangements with a partner as important as the United States. (The key issue in the strike-down was the risk of disproportionate access – and the nature of oversight of the access – by US national security and law enforcement agencies to personal data held by private entities, and the risk of this including transferred data from the EU.)” It added that several witnesses said that if the UK were to lose adequacy status, “they would expect the UK and European Commission to implement one or several immediate ‘workarounds’, to avoid the cliff-edge scenario and buy time in which to take steps that would see adequacy restored”. Suggested alternatives to data adequacy include the use of multilateral agreements and legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCR). However, doubt was cast on validity of the SCC route by Schrems II, which found although these were legally valid, companies still had a responsibility to ensure that those they shared the data with granted privacy protections equivalent to those contained in EU law. According to Owen Sayers – an independent security consultant and enterprise architect with more than 25 years of experience in delivering secure solutions to policing – there is a risk the EAC has collapsed the distinction between GDPR and LED adequacy by too closely aligning them in form, function and nature, when they are “structurally veery different” to one another. “Under GDPR you can quite simply transfer data if you have adequacy,” he said. “Under LED, it is very hard, and for some specific organisations is virtually impossible, to transfer data unless you have adequacy. “These sound quite similar conditions, but they’re poles apart – ‘you can do if’ is intrinsically permissive in nature; whereas ‘you cannot do unless’ is a barrier control. Even if you do have LED adequacy, you are then restricted as to who in your target country you wish to send that data to.” The EAC added there are a range of issues that would be of “interest and potential concern” to both the EC and CJEU as they consider the UK’s adequacy statuses. This includes potential divergence on data protection standards that would make it harder for people to exercise their data rights; the possibility that the UK government undermines end-to-end encryption; the independence and effectiveness of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO); aspects of the UK’s national security regime under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, including data collection and retention, surveillance powers and practices, and the role of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal; and any legal cases which provide grounds for concern about UK data protection standards. The EAC also highlighted potential risks posed by onward transfers of data from the UK to other third countries, including under the UK-US Cloud Agreement. “All this means that government and public services generally need to take a hard look at their governance of data and AI deployment ahead of their ambitious plans for tech adoption in the public sector,” Clement-Jones told Computer Weekly. While the EAC itself did not assess the impacts on adequacy of IT systems already procured and in-use, the growing use of US-based public cloud services by UK police and the wider criminal justice sector has previously been cited to Computer Weekly as a potentially huge problem for the UK’s ability to obtain LED adequacy, primarily due to the potential for remote access to that data and its onward transfer to a non-adequate jurisdiction. Since Computer Weekly revealed in December 2020 that dozens of UK police forces were processing more than a million people’s data unlawfully in Microsoft 365, data protection experts and police tech regulators have questioned various aspects of how hyperscale public cloud infrastructure has been deployed by UK policing, arguing that they are currently unable to comply with strict law enforcement-specific rules laid out in the DPA. At the start of April 2023, Computer Weekly then revealed the Scottish government’s Digital Evidence Sharing Capability (DESC) service – contracted to body-worn video provider Axon for delivery and hosted on Microsoft Azure – was being piloted by Police Scotland despite a police watchdog raising concerns about how the use of Azure “would not be legal”. Specifically, the police watchdog said that there were a number of other unresolved high risks to data subjects, such as US government access via the Cloud Act, which effectively gives the US government access to any data, stored anywhere, by US corporations in the cloud; Microsoft’s use of generic, rather than specific, contracts; and Axon’s inability to comply with contractual clauses around data sovereignty. Computer Weekly also revealed that Microsoft, Axon and the ICO were all aware of these issues before processing in DESC began. The risks identified extend to every public cloud system used for a law enforcement purpose in the UK, as they are governed by the same data protection rules. In June 2024, Computer Weekly then reported details of discussions between Microsoft and the Scottish Police Authority (SPA), in which the tech giant admitted it cannot guarantee the sovereignty of UK policing data hosted on its hyperscale public cloud infrastructure. Specifically, it showed that data hosted in Microsoft infrastructure is routinely transferred and processed overseas; that the data processing agreement in place for DESC did not cover UK-specific data protection requirements; and that while the company claimed it has the ability to make technical changes to ensure data protection compliance, it is only prepared to make these changes for DESC partners and not other policing bodies because “no one else had asked”. The documents also contain acknowledgements from Microsoft that international data transfers are inherent to its public cloud architecture, and that limiting transfers based on individual approvals by a Police Force – as required under DPA Part 3 – “cannot be operationalised”. Although the ICO released its police cloud guidance in the same set of FOI disclosures – which highlights some potential data transfer mechanisms it thinks can clear up ongoing legal issues – data protection experts questioned the viability of the suggested routes on the basis the mechanisms are rooted in the GDPR rather than the law enforcement-specific rules contained in Part 3, and that is it not clear if they can in fact prevent US government access. Computer Weekly contacted the Home Office about the how data protection issues with existing systems that have already been procured and deployed could affect LED adequacy, but received no response by time of publication. Commenting on the issue of police data protection and sovereignty, Clement-Jones said: “The revelation of police forces’ failure to observe the requirements of Part Three raises real issues for ongoing adequacy, but also for any trust in the governance around the way technologies such as live facial recognition are deployed.” According to Sayers, even if the mechanisms suggested by the ICO could prevent US government access, the transfers would be unlawful anyway as UK law lays down a series of specific steps that must be followed for each and every transfer of a specific piece of personal data under Part 3. “These steps are not being followed, and Microsoft have made clear that they cannot be followed (actually, they said ‘impossible to operationalise’). Because the steps laid down in the DPA 2018 Part 3 are not and cannot be followed, that is one of the main reasons why the processing done on these clouds is in breach of UK law,” he said. “It makes zero difference at all if the US government bogeyman tries to use Cloud Act to look at the data, as the data was illegally transferred regardless of cloud act.” Sayers added that the EAC principally looked at what UK law says in relation to LED and what the impacts of this are, but missed a “huge area of consideration” in whether the UK actually adheres to its own data protection laws in practice. “That is where the policing stuff becomes interesting, because if the EU examine the UK's operating track record of compliance with their own domestic version of LED (Part Three), then it’s clear that they absolutely do not comply with it to any real measure,” he said. “To be adequate, the EU might simply look at the legislation in force; but I think they also need to consider the available evidence of UK behaviour (and if they do that the picture is far from rosy). “The reason they need to consider the latter is that presently if an EU citizens data is sent to a UK law enforcement body, it is almost certainly going to be processed in contravention of UK DP laws. That means it’s certainly being processed in contravention of EU LED-based laws.”

Title: MicroStrategy Touches New Highs as Trading Volume Relative to Nvidia Surges

Election 2024 coverage presented by Disclosure: The author of this story owns shares in MicroStrategy (MSTR). Bitcoin (BTC)-holder MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) soaring stock is driving up trading volumes relative to AI-proxy Nvidia (NVDA), one of the biggest companies by market cap, reflecting heightened investor enthusiasm. MSTR has surged over 240% this year, with prices doubling to $236 in the past five weeks alone, according to data source TradingView. That’s the highest level for the stock since the dotcom bubble 25 years ago. The rally has MSTR closing in on a market cap of $50 billion, barely 1.5% of NVDA’s $3.44 trillion. However, MSTR’s trading volume, as a percentage against NVDA, has continued to climb this year, reaching a high of 17.65% this month. According to Investing.com data, this milestone occurred on Oct. 11, as MicroStrategy saw 30 million trading volume, while NVIDIA had 170 million. That’s a significant improvement since the bull market of 2021. Back then, MSTR peaked over $130 on Feb. 9 with a volume of 23.2 million, equating to just 8% of NVDA that day. An increase in trading volumes alongside a price rally may confirm the stock's uptrend. That said, a continued surge in volume relative to NVDA might be telling of a build up of a speculative froth in the market. With a year-to-date gain of over 240%, MSTR has outperformed NVDA’s 192% surge by a big margin. Since MSTR adopted bitcoin as a treasury asset in August 2020, the gap has grown even bigger, with MSTR up 1,800% versus NVDA’s 1,150%, that’s probably the best evidence of MicroStrategy and its CEO Michael Saylor’s success. MicroStrategy’s net asset value (NAV), which is is calculated by dividing MSTR's market capitalization by the value of its bitcoin stack, continues to expand once again, with bitcoin still trending in the mid $60,000 range. According to the MSTR tracker, the NAV premium currently sits at almost 3, the highest level since early 2021. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Now, as Wall Street giant JPMorgan issues a huge bitcoin price prediction, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) have each published papers "attacking" bitcoin—branded a "declaration of war." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has helped the bitcoin price boom this year with plans for ... [+] drastic interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis has published a paper this week arguing bitcoin and similar assets could be taxed or banned to help governments maintain deficits. "A legal prohibition against bitcoin can restore unique implementation of permanent primary deficits, and so can a tax on bitcoin," the paper's authors wrote, adding bitcoin creates a "balanced budget trap" that highlights spending shortfalls. The Fed has "joined the European Central Bank in its attack on bitcoin," said VanEck's head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel, writing in an X thread that the paper "fantasizes about 'legal prohibition' and extra taxes on bitcoin to ensure government debt remains the 'only risk-free security.'" The bitcoin price has surged along with the price of gold this year as investors bet higher interest rates combined with a huge increase in deficits will create a feedback loop, forcing governments to print more money. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiraling out of control and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024. The Fed's paper follows a report from the ECB that argues “the existence of bitcoin impoverishes both non-holders and latecomers," describing it as a "zero-sum game" in which bitcoin buyers "increase their real wealth and consumption" at the expense of others. "The ECB claims that early bitcoin adopters steal economic value from latecomers," bitcoin analyst Tuur Demeester posted to X, calling the paper "a true declaration of war" and adding he "strongly believes authorities will use this luddite argument to enact harsh taxes or bans."

The ECB paper warns that continued bitcoin price appreciation could divide society and calls for government action that would "prevent bitcoin prices from rising or to see bitcoin disappear altogether." "Non-holders should recognize that bitcoin’s rise is fueled by wealth redistribution at their expense," ECB senior management adviser and report author Jürgen Schaaf posted to X. "There are compelling reasons to advocate for policies that curb bitcoin's growth or even eliminate it." Earlier this month, Italy's government said it was considering raising the capital gains tax on bitcoin to 42% from 26% while just this week in Denmark politicians proposed taxing unrealized bitcoin and crypto gains.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 25 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research.

Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 25 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold Nvidia Stock?

CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, speaks during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia stock alone has created more value in the last three years than the combined market cap of 250 companies in the S&P 500. Talk about the 1% — specifically, $3 trillion! But everyone knows that. The bigger question is: what’s next? Should you buy, sell, or hold Nvidia at this point? In our recent analyses, we argued for a range of outcomes: Nvidia’s road to $300 and the counterpoint Nvidia’s downside to $40. Intuitive Surgical is No Dud Either — Here’s Path to 10x NVDA stock swelled over 10x from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $140 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular – as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Now, below are the facts, and a concrete view of how you might want to think of Nvidia in your portfolio. Answer: Add Nvidia to your portfolio in the amount such that while you sit envisioning a 5x gain in the long term, you’re also willing to stomach 50% loss at any time during the ride. Yep, be willing to bear short-term pain - the price you’ll pay - to be rewarded in the long run. This sounds simple in theory but is never easy to live by in practice. Below are more specifics on the pros and cons. Here’s the thing, competition is heating up. AMD isn’t sitting idle - the company has doubled down on AI-focused GPUs and claims its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s in several areas. Intel is also emerging as a competitor, gaining traction with value-priced AI chips. Moreover, big tech players like Google - one of Nvidia’s biggest customers - are developing their own AI and machine learning silicon. With these rivals, the rapid growth in Nvidia’s revenues and the unusually high levels of Nvidia’s cash-flow margins (over 50% in recent quarters) may not be sustainable. The underlying economics of the AI GPU market remain weak, with most of Nvidia’s customers still unprofitable. Why is that? Large language models are expensive to build and train and the payoff can take a long time. VC firm Sequoia estimates that the AI industry spent $50 billion on Nvidia chips last year, possibly exceeding $100 billion when including other costs. Yet, these investments have only generated about $3 billion in revenue, with few services besides ChatGPT gaining large, paying user bases. We may well be in an AI “FOMO phase,” where companies feel compelled to invest in AI simply because their competitors are. As shareholders seek better returns, capital spending may cool off, impacting companies like Nvidia. Separately, large AI deployments follow two stages. The first is the compute-intensive training phase, during which AI models are built from large datasets with GPUs being used to process data and adjust the model’s parameters. The second stage is the deployment phase, where trained models run in real-world applications and typically require lower processing power, allowing companies to use less expensive hardware to run models for daily tasks. As the AI revolution began just about two years ago, most companies are in the training phase and there is a possibility that demand could ease off as we move towards lower power inferencing. Nvidia has had a head start in the AI market. And it has the foresight to not let its early mover advantage slip away. The company has built a comprehensive ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages and software, which can lock customers into its products as they scale up their AI investments. Nvidia’s extensive software stack - including CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT - not only enhances performance but also simplifies AI development, making it increasingly difficult and costly for companies to switch to alternative platforms. Look at it this way. As companies deploy their AI bets they will be spending time and resources on training, tuning their AI models, and integrating these tools into their broader IT systems and workflows. This makes it more difficult and costly to shift to competitors. The ecosystem could help to protect Nvidia’s margins, with software-related sales also likely expanding in the long run. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal meaning that they work with speech, images, video, and 3D content - calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power - particularly with processors - outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia. The shift in U.S. monetary policy could also give Nvidia an extra lift. The Fed’s 50 basis point cut - the first in nearly four years - brings the federal funds rate to 4.75%-5%, with room for further reductions. Lower rates boost growth sectors like tech by increasing the present value of future earnings. The rate cuts are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move?

Title: Morning Bid: Megacap earnings loom, Japan decides, gilts wobble

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Tesla's 20%-plus stock surge whets investor appetites for next week's earnings from most of the rest of the "Magnificent 7" of U.S. megacaps - with overseas markets keeping close tabs on weekend elections in Japan and next week's UK budget. A relatively quiet end to a busy week sees market attention drift to numerous big events coming down the pike, not least the U.S. election in 11 days time. But the related edginess in the Treasury market earlier this week seems to have settled for now and the White House race remains far too close to call. Relatively upbeat economic numbers on business activity, jobless claims and housing did little to disturb the slightly calmer bond waters - especially as business price pressures appear to have eased further and oil prices retreated again. Ten-year yields hovered on 4.2% early on Friday, with the Federal Reserve's cyclical rate trough now seen as high 3.5% - close to Fed policymakers' highest estimates of the so-called 'neutral' long-term policy rate. The dollar index also held the line with Treasuries. For stocks, all the action was in earnings - with Tesla shares clocking their biggest single-day gain in over a decade as CEO Elon Musk's forecast of surging sales reassured investors he was still focussed on a core electric car business. The stock spike puts Tesla shares back in the black for the year to date and now tilts the market to updates from the other six megacaps next week - starting with Alphabet's quarterlies on Tuesday, Microsoft and Meta on Wednesday and Amazon and Apple on Thursday. Overall, the S&P500 ended three days of losses and closed marginally higher on Thursday, with futures up further ahead of Friday open. Japan's yen nudged lower through 152 per dollar as Sunday's election results and Wednesday's Bank of Japan policy decision were awaited, with data showing Tokyo inflation ebbing this month against a backdrop of fresh government warnings about excessive currency moves. For some investors, the risk of Japan ending up with a minority coalition government after the weekend poll raises some concerns that the BOJ could face complications in its quest to gradually normalise its super-easy interest rates. Several recent polls have increased speculation the ruling coalition could lose its majority in parliament, which could cost new premier Shigeru Ishiba his job or force his Liberal Democratic Party to look for another coalition partner to stay in power. And such a prospect may deprive the BOJ of the consensus support needed to push ahead with raising rates, some reckon. Britain provided the other big focus of the weekahead, with reports of significantly higher borrowing to fund a public investment push unnerving UK government bonds on Thursday. Finance minister Rachel Reeves said that next Wednesday she will announce a change to the measure of public debt that the government targets over a five year period in order to allow billions of pounds of more borrowing for investment. Economists estimate that had this measure been in place in March, it would have created scope for more than 50 billion pounds ($65 billion) of extra borrowing, equivalent to about 1.5% of Britain's annual economic output. In stark contrast to the retreat in U.S. yields on Thursday, the British bond market juddered at the prospect of higher borrowing tallies - with 10-year gilt yields hitting their highest in almost four months and the five-year yield premium over Germany reaching its highest this year. The pound has held steady to firmer, however, showing no wider disturbance to investor confidence. Elsewhere, most stock markets in Europe and Asia were higher on Friday - with Japan's Nikkei the underperformer. Above-forecast German business confidence readings from Ifo eased some of the gloom about Europe's biggest economy - but there are persistent concerns about the country's mammoth auto sector as trade tensions with China build. German automaker Mercedes-Benz fell 3.7% after third-quarter earnings in its core car division massively missed estimates, while France's Valeo shed 7.5% as the automotive supplier cut its annual sales guidance for the second time this year. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * US September durable goods orders, University of Michigan October consumer survey; Canada Sept house prices, August retail sales and government budget balance * US corporate earnings: Aon, Colgate-Palmolive, Centene, HCA Healthcare * International Monetary Fund and World Bank Annual Meetings in Washington, speakers include German Finance Minister Christian Lindner, Budesbank President Joachim Nagel and Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem * Boston Federal Reserve Bank of President Susan Collins speaks (By Mike Dolan,; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com) Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Jim Cramer On Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA): ‘Tim Wentworth Is Really An Excellent CEO’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled, Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stands against other stock picks by Jim Cramer. On Monday, Jim Cramer of Mad Money took a closer look at the market’s recent movements, reassuring investors that rising bond yields shouldn’t cause excessive worry. He noted that bond yields have surged significantly since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, a trend that might seem counterintuitive. Cramer acknowledged that bonds were behind Monday’s “ugly action in the big caps”. The Dow fell by 344 points, the S&P slipped by 0.18%, while the Nasdaq managed a slight gain of 0.27%. Cramer emphasized that while bonds play a crucial role, they aren’t the sole factor influencing the market’s performance, despite what some may claim. He expressed his frustration with those who panic at the sight of rising interest rates, suggesting that such reactions are misguided. Cramer pointed out that the stock market has experienced a remarkable rally. “The stock market has had a fabulous run, even as bond yields have crept up almost the entire time. They love to ignore that glaring fact, the bears. Every day is groundhog day for them. They see interest rates go up higher, so they panic themselves and they are trying to panic us.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer on Taiwan Semiconductor, Netflix, and Other Stocks and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In Cramer proceeded to break down the arguments typically made by bond bears, who often use long-term interest rates as a weapon against the Fed. He criticized their simplistic approach, where rising rates are blamed on the Federal Reserve while falling rates somehow earn them credit. According to him, the Fed’s recent decision to cut rates by 50 basis points was necessary. “… Here’s the simple truth, did the Fed need to do a double rate cut moving 50 basis points and not 25? Yes. Yes, they had to do it if they wanted to be sure that the proverbial plane didn’t crash.” He firmly stated that Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is simply fulfilling his duties responsibly, and those who continuously express skepticism will ultimately be proven wrong. Addressing the notion that a rate cut would trigger inflation, Cramer pointed out that the bond market’s reaction suggests that the initial cut has already sparked fears of inflation resurgence. He challenged the idea that the effects of a rate cut are immediate, asserting that higher loan rates, particularly for 30-year mortgages, can actually have an anti-inflationary effect, contrary to what some might believe. He highlighted that the most pressing concern in the inflation landscape remains housing. Cramer also tackled the prevailing belief among bears that stock prices cannot rise if interest rates increase. He dismissed this idea as arbitrary, asserting that we are far from a situation where higher rates would definitively damage the bull market. “We are nowhere near the point where the bull can be slain by higher, longer rates… Stocks have soared with bond yields at these levels before; in fact, they’ve soared with the 30-year at 5%, they’ve soared with the 30-year at 6%, so let’s stop it with the jeremiads.” Ultimately, he argued that such fears merely drive investors away from solid companies that are performing well. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the lightning round of his episodes of Mad Money on October 18 and 21. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 When Cramer was questioned about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), he said: “The good news… is that Tim Wentworth is really an excellent CEO. The bad news is you’re up against Amazon… But I’m a believer in Tim. I really hope it works. But that is a one tough spot he’s got himself in.” Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is a well-known name in the retail pharmacy industry, operating over 12,500 locations across the United States, Europe, and Latin America. The company’s diverse portfolio features well-known brands such as Walgreens, Boots, Duane Reade, the No7 Beauty Company, and Benavides in Mexico. In recent times, the company has faced increasing competition from tech-driven retailers like Walmart and Amazon, which are making significant inroads into the pharmacy sector. These competitors not only offer extensive loyalty programs, such as Walmart+ and Amazon Prime but also provide the convenience of delivering a broad range of items alongside prescriptions. Such a capability may give them an edge in the online marketplace, challenging traditional pharmacy models like Walgreens. During its latest earnings call, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) management provided insights into the company’s future direction, highlighting a plan to close 1,200 underperforming stores. The decision shows that there is an awareness of the need to adapt and modernize in a rapidly changing retail environment. Tim Wentworth emphasized that out of over 8,000 stores, approximately 6,000 are currently profitable, which supports the belief in a retail pharmacy-led model that remains relevant to consumers. The initiative to close less productive locations is expected to reduce fixed costs and free up resources for reinvestment in the remaining stores over the coming years. Overall, WBA ranks 8th on our list of latest stock picks by Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of WBA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WBA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 Cramer called e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.’s (NYSE:ELF) situation complicated but also guessed that it would return faster than others in the group. Here’s what he had to say: “Well, remember, this is a very tough situation because all of cosmetics are in a downturn that is so staggering that it caught everybody by surprise, especially Fabrizio Freda at Estee Lauder. I think Estee Lauder is not as good as E.l.f, but I recognize that this group is in the doldrums. I don’t want to make a single call on a group decline. I do think that when they come back, this one will come back faster than all of them.” e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a big name in the cosmetics industry and provides a diverse range of cosmetic and skin care products offered under several brand names, including e.l.f. Cosmetics, e.l.f. Skin, Well People, Naturium, and Keys Soulcare. The company has recently reported significant growth, marking a strong beginning to the fiscal year. Tarang Amin, e.l.f. Beauty’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer highlighted that the company achieved 50% net sales growth in the first quarter, along with an increase of 260 basis points in market share. The achievement signifies the 22nd consecutive quarter of growth in both sales and market share, positioning the company among a select group of high-growth consumer companies. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) generated revenue of $324.5 million, a substantial 50% increase compared to the same period the previous year. Non-U.S. markets contributed significantly to this growth, accounting for 16% of total net sales, with net sales from these markets soaring by 91% year-over-year. The company’s updated outlook for fiscal 2025 expects a year-over-year increase in net sales of 25% to 27%, an upward revision from the earlier expectation of 20% to 22%. Overall, ELF ranks 7th on our list of latest stock picks by Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ELF as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs see $380 net inflow in 2 days with BlackRock leading the charge
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-sees-380-net-inflow-in-2-days-with-blackrock-leading-the-charge/
Time Published: 2024-10-25T07:48:13Z
Full Content:
IBIT dominates Bitcoin ETF inflows with $482 million 2-day surge. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) showed mixed activity over the past two days, following a net outflow of $79.1 million on Oct. 22 that ended a seven-day inflow streak totaling over $2.4 billion since Oct. 14. On Oct. 23, ETFs registered a net inflow of $192.4 million. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led with $317.5 million in new investments, while ARK’s Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) saw significant outflows of $99 million. Bitwise’s BITB also recorded an outflow of $25.2 million. The following day, Oct. 24, ETFs continued to attract capital with a net inflow of $188 million. IBIT maintained its strong performance, bringing in an additional $165.5 million. Bitwise’s BITB reversed its previous day’s outflow by gaining $29.6 million. However, Grayscale’s BTC fund experienced a minor outflow of $7.1 million. The sustained inflows into IBIT highlight its prominent role in offering traditional investment exposure to Bitcoin. President of the ETF Store, Nate Geraci, pointed out BlackRock’s performance on Oct. 24 alone “would easily put IBIT in top 10% of all launches in 2024 (out of 575+ ETFs).” Conversely, the outflows from ARKB suggest possible profit-taking or shifts in investment strategies.

Title: NUKZ: Brand-New Nuclear Energy ETF is one of 2024’s Hottest ETFs

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The brand new Range Nuclear Renaissance ETF (NUKZ) is one of the hottest ETFs of 2024, gaining nearly 70% since its launch in January. And while AI and large-cap tech have gotten most of the limelight from investors this year, NUKZ focuses on a different segment of the market entirely – nuclear energy. That said, NUKZ is still an intriguing way to potentially gain backdoor exposure to the growth of AI, the growing need for data centers, and other big tech themes. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to its impressive performance and its exposure to uranium producers, utilities, and manufacturers that are essential for the potential shift toward nuclear energy. This transition is becoming increasingly urgent as the need for sustainable energy solutions becomes more evident. The NUKZ ETF was launched on January 23, 2024, by Range ETFs. It is still a small fund with $40.7 in assets under management (AUM), but it picked a good time to debut as investor interest in nuclear energy is reaching new heights in 2024. According to Range ETFs, NUKZ “is designed to provide exposure to companies that are involved in the following segments: advanced reactor, utilities, construction & services, and fuel.” Nuclear energy is a clean and efficient form of energy. It produces no greenhouse gases, and it is more efficient and reliable than solar or wind energy. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy finds that the typical nuclear plant has a capacity factor of 92.5%, meaning it is working at full capacity 92.5% of the time, versus just 35.4% for wind and a paltry 24.9% for solar. Nuclear energy is a baseload energy source that is more reliable than solar and wind. Consulting firm McKinsey forecasts that electricity demand will triple by 2050, so there is clearly a need for the efficient and clean baseload energy that nuclear can provide. Plus, with so much demand likely to come online, there is room for multiple winners as nuclear, solar, wind, and natural gas will all be needed, so this isn’t a zero-sum game. The AI revolution is also putting a finer point on this growing demand for power. More data centers are being built to house the computing power that hyperscalers need to power their AI solutions, and nuclear energy can play a key role in providing them with clean energy. Already, we’ve seen mega-cap tech companies commit to and invest in nuclear energy. Amazon recently announced its support for several new nuclear projects in Washington and Virginia, including the construction of new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), an exciting new breed of nuclear reactor with a smaller physical footprint and shorter lead time. Also, Alphabet (GOOG) announced it will buy nuclear power produced by SMRs that will be developed by a company called Kairos Power. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) struck a deal with major power company Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. NUKZ owns 39 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 53.4% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of NUKZ’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. The fund’s largest holding is Cameco (CCO), the world’s largest uranium producer. Beyond Cameco, NUKZ also owns utilities like Constellation Energy, which maintains the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in the United States with 21 nuclear reactors. The fund also owns NuScale Power (SMR), which makes the types of small module reactors discussed above. There’s also a place for Industrials, like GE Vernova (GEV) and Honeywell (HON) within the NUKZ ETF. GE Vernova manufactures nuclear turbine islands used by nuclear plants, while Honeywell operates a uranium conversion facility that makes a component needed for the enriched nuclear fuel utilized by nuclear reactors. One word of caution is that as a new ETF with relatively low assets under management, NUKZ is an expensive ETF, charging a fee of 0.85%. This means that an investor allocating $10,000 into the fund will pay $85 in fees on an annual basis. This is considerably more expensive than the fees many investors are used to seeing with broad-market index ETFs, and well above the average expense ratio for all ETFs (0.52%). If the ETF continues to perform well over the long term, the high expense ratio won’t trouble many holders, but it is something for investors to keep in mind, especially if the ETF’s performance begins to lag. Aside from the high expense ratio, other risks to this investment include the fact that it is a new ETF without a long-term track record, and a very small one at that, so it could prove volatile. Stocks in this space have already had quite a run in 2024, so there could be volatility to the downside. However, overall, I believe this is still a good long-term investment, as we are still in the early stages of the nuclear story. Turning to Wall Street, NUKZ earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average NUKZ stock price target of $42.38 implies about 2.0% upside potential from current levels. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to the increasing demand for clean and efficient baseload energy as electricity consumption rises. The recent embrace of nuclear energy by major tech firms like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft underscores its importance in powering data centers and is attracting new investor interest in these stocks. Moreover, we are still in the early stages of the transition to nuclear energy. While NUKZ has performed well in 2024, there is likely significant upside potential ahead, though volatility is expected along the way. Additionally, NUKZ provides a solid way to gain broad exposure to the nuclear energy sector, investing in uranium producers like Cameco, utilities such as Constellation Energy, and reactor manufacturers like NuScale.

Title: Michael Saylor Backpedals On Controversial Bitcoin Statement After Backlash
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-backpedals-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-10-25T04:00:24Z
Full Content:
In a recent interview with journalist Madison Reidy, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, ignited significant controversy within the Bitcoin community over his remarks on custody and regulation. Addressing concerns about the risks of large amounts of BTC being held by third-party custodians and major institutions, Saylor argued against self-custody and downplayed fears of increased seizure or confiscation. Saylor posited that BTC is more secure when held by regulated public entities such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan Chase, rather than by unregulated private holders. He stated, “I think it’s the opposite. I think that when Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure.” The backlash from the BTC community was swift and intense, as Bitcoinist reported. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin labeled Saylor’s statement as “batshit insane,” reflecting the strong disapproval from prominent figures in the crypto space. Facing mounting criticism, Saylor appears to have softened his stance. Via X, he clarified: “I support self-custody for those willing & able, the right to self-custody for all, and freedom to choose the form of custody & custodian for individuals & institutions globally. #Bitcoin benefits from all forms of investment by all types of entities, and should welcome everyone.” Gabor Gurbacs, founder of PointsVille and a strategist at Tether, commented that Saylor’s adjusted stance “shouldn’t be a controversial position” and considered it “just common sense.” However, not all were convinced by Saylor’s clarification. Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser expressed concerns that the importance of self-custody—a defining aspect of BTC’s value proposition—was not adequately communicated. He highlighted the high risks associated with having others custody one’s Bitcoin and noted that self-custody and the separation of state and money are key characteristics that define it. “To be clear, El Salvador is opening up Bitcoin banks attached with caveats clearly stating that self-custody—and the separation of state & money—are key characteristics that define Bitcoin. Bitcoin is transforming money & the concept of the nation state too; as it’s been understood for 300 years,” he added. Industry analyst James Van Straten speculated that MicroStrategy is positioning itself as a BTC bank, aligning with predictions made by Hal Finney back in 2010. While advocating for self-custody, Van Straten acknowledged that institutional involvement and ease of access, such as through ETFs, are significant drivers of BTC adoption. “Saylor is playing a completely different game than the average pleb. Depending on the next US administration, he has to position himself carefully. I would argue it’s even more stupid to position himself as a crypto-anarchist. If he deems yield is necessary, then it is. Got the first four years right,” Van Straten writes via X. Joe Burnett from Unchained offered a succinct take: “Incredibly based.” Conversely, Joel Valenzuela, involved in business development and marketing for Dash, remarked on X: “Capitulation. But you showed your true colors.” At press time, BTC traded at $67,700. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: It’s Still the Economy, Stupid Globalists!

Time Published: 2024-10-25T04:00:00Z

A paradigm shift occurs when there is a radical change in thinking from an accepted point of view to a new one. Changes in social consciousness are not easy. Institutions defend orthodoxy with all their assorted powers, while new ideas receive support only from iconoclasts who are often dismissed as kooks or disparaged as domestic enemies. Prevailing opinion is like a heavy boulder sitting in the valley between several steep hills. For a novel idea to succeed, its proponents must push that boulder up the slope until it reaches the top of a neighboring peak. Two observations follow from this analogy: (1) when moving the heavy boulder of conventional wisdom in a new direction, the gravity of traditional consensus works to roll it right back into the valley where it originally rested, and (2) once the boulder is finally pushed up a hill with the force of sufficient evidence and popular support, it will quickly roll down the other side and rest in a new valley of conventional wisdom. Changing human minds, in other words, is a punishing exercise until you reach a tipping point, when social change occurs rapidly. We are right now in the midst of one of these phenomenal paradigm shifts. Americans are “awakening” to the idea that the federal government does not have their best interests at heart. They are pushing back against mass illegal immigration. They are resisting government surveillance and censorship. They are questioning economic regulations that have weakened private property rights while giving a small number of corporations and financial elites almost total control over commerce, the food supply, and the monetary system. During the half-century Cold War, Americans often turned a blind eye toward questionable military strategies, Intelligence Community actions, and economic policies because a pervasive “us vs. them” attitude kept the country united against common communist enemies. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the expansion of Western business interests into communist China, this us/them dynamic began to fade away. As companies in the United States replaced domestic workers with foreign workers — and eventually Chinese slave labor — Americans realized that the distinctions between so-called “authoritarian” States and so-called “democratic” States were not as stark as they had once seemed. The offshoring of good manufacturing and industrial jobs in the United States to countries that had been considered competitors, adversaries, or even enemies softened the ground for the paradigm shift we see today. In the ’92 presidential contest, independent candidate Ross Perot warned that the North American Free Trade Agreement would move jobs and money to Mexico and leave Americans worse off. George Bush and Bill Clinton disagreed, and Republicans and Democrats argued that NAFTA would both discourage illegal immigration (by providing jobs south of the American border) and increase household wealth (by decreasing the cost of consumer goods). Prices for many products did go down, because that’s what happens when the cost of labor goes from $13/hour (when made in America) to $1/hour (when made in Mexico or Central America). However beneficial such price decreases in essential household items might have been, there was a tremendous cost — the destruction of blue-collar towns across the United States. Ross Perot’s entirely rational prediction came true, and the “giant sucking sound” of jobs and money going south ultimately made Americans poorer. As a cherry on top of the toxic NAFTA sundae, rampant illegal immigration continued unabated largely because the U.S. welfare system remains an attractive nuisance that draws foreign nationals who prefer America’s generous handouts to the blue-collar jobs in their own countries. This hollowing out of the American middle class continued every time Republicans and Democrats inked another “free trade deal” that made it easier for American companies to invest in slave labor overseas. As the cost of such deals became more widely apparent, the “ruling class” in D.C. became more inventive with its justifications. Bill Clinton opened up trade with communist China not because American companies could make a bundle from a workforce willing to work for subsistence wages, but rather because the introduction of Western commerce to China would be the camel’s nose under the communist tent. Globalization, in other words, was sold as a peaceful foreign policy that would make our adversaries more like us while avoiding military conflict and nuclear bluster. If blue jeans and the Beatles could collapse the Iron Curtain, then McDonald’s “Golden Arches” diplomacy would democratize communist China. At least that’s the hogwash Americans heard, as they watched their jobs move to the other side of the world. The costs for such foreign policy pipe dreams have been immense. Over three decades of “free trade deals,” Americans have lost millions of jobs, household savings have disappeared, the wealth gap between the top 1% and everyone else has significantly widened, drug- and alcohol-related deaths have skyrocketed, property theft and violent crime rates have steadily risen, and towns across the country have become rusted monuments to apathy and neglect. What did American workers get in exchange for so many lost jobs sent overseas? Nothing good. Once-important domestic companies have become multinational behemoths devoid of any sense of national allegiance. Moreover, as these companies have exponentially increased their wealth and global reach, they have also exponentially increased their influence over the foreign and domestic policy decisions of the U.S. government. (BlackRock, for example, set up shop in the Biden White House, and the corporate press mostly hid this inconvenient truth from the public.) China, a third-world nation three decades ago that could not feed its own citizens and seemed near collapse, has become a regional powerhouse with global reach. America, on the other hand, has crippled its own industrial and manufacturing self-sufficiency. In fact, it depends on China for critical pharmaceuticals, electronics components, metals, and finished products. “Golden Arches” diplomacy failed to democratize communist China. Instead, the U.S. government embraced the mass surveillance and censorship of its totalitarian adversary. Finally, a combination of catastrophically expensive “green energy” policies, profligate government spending, and economically unsound central bank money printing has set the United States down an untenable path toward runaway inflation, dollar destabilization, and financial ruin. Globalization, in other words, has left Americans poorer, more miserable, less optimistic about the future, and dangerously disconnected from their government. At the same time, their geopolitical enemies have never been more emboldened. That’s a gargantuan price tag for no reward. The more that the U.S. government struggles to maintain its status as a global superpower with a witches’ brew of money-printing, welfare spending, and mass illegal immigration (the last ingredient being used as both a deflationary pressure on wages as well as a cynical tactic to distract Americans with cultural conflict and political strife), the more it resembles a Potemkin village incapable of withstanding scrutiny. Americans look at all they have lost over the last thirty years, and they wonder how the people running the federal government could be both spectacularly incompetent and magnificently malicious. Imaginary pronouns, forcing men into women’s sports, and hyperventilating about COVID and “climate change” can distract the American people for only so long. Eventually, a vocal leader comes along and finds America’s globalist boulder stuck in a deep ravine. No doubt that boulder has many notes attached from sage voices such as Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan all saying, “Tried to move this up the hill, but it kept falling back down.” But if enough Americans join together, President Trump might have just enough strength to heave the boulder to the other side. “Make America Great Again” is a rallying cry for Americans to lift the country up despite the weight of Deep State opposition. The hilltop lies ahead. Keep pushing with all your might. Image: N509FZ via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0. A paradigm shift occurs when there is a radical change in thinking from an accepted point of view to a new one. Changes in social consciousness are not easy. Institutions defend orthodoxy with all their assorted powers, while new ideas receive support only from iconoclasts who are often dismissed as kooks or disparaged as domestic enemies. Prevailing opinion is like a heavy boulder sitting in the valley between several steep hills. For a novel idea to succeed, its proponents must push that boulder up the slope until it reaches the top of a neighboring peak. Two observations follow from this analogy: (1) when moving the heavy boulder of conventional wisdom in a new direction, the gravity of traditional consensus works to roll it right back into the valley where it originally rested, and (2) once the boulder is finally pushed up a hill with the force of sufficient evidence and popular support, it will quickly roll down the other side and rest in a new valley of conventional wisdom. Changing human minds, in other words, is a punishing exercise until you reach a tipping point, when social change occurs rapidly. We are right now in the midst of one of these phenomenal paradigm shifts. Americans are “awakening” to the idea that the federal government does not have their best interests at heart. They are pushing back against mass illegal immigration. They are resisting government surveillance and censorship. They are questioning economic regulations that have weakened private property rights while giving a small number of corporations and financial elites almost total control over commerce, the food supply, and the monetary system. During the half-century Cold War, Americans often turned a blind eye toward questionable military strategies, Intelligence Community actions, and economic policies because a pervasive “us vs. them” attitude kept the country united against common communist enemies. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the expansion of Western business interests into communist China, this us/them dynamic began to fade away. As companies in the United States replaced domestic workers with foreign workers — and eventually Chinese slave labor — Americans realized that the distinctions between so-called “authoritarian” States and so-called “democratic” States were not as stark as they had once seemed. The offshoring of good manufacturing and industrial jobs in the United States to countries that had been considered competitors, adversaries, or even enemies softened the ground for the paradigm shift we see today. In the ’92 presidential contest, independent candidate Ross Perot warned that the North American Free Trade Agreement would move jobs and money to Mexico and leave Americans worse off. George Bush and Bill Clinton disagreed, and Republicans and Democrats argued that NAFTA would both discourage illegal immigration (by providing jobs south of the American border) and increase household wealth (by decreasing the cost of consumer goods). Prices for many products did go down, because that’s what happens when the cost of labor goes from $13/hour (when made in America) to $1/hour (when made in Mexico or Central America). However beneficial such price decreases in essential household items might have been, there was a tremendous cost — the destruction of blue-collar towns across the United States. Ross Perot’s entirely rational prediction came true, and the “giant sucking sound” of jobs and money going south ultimately made Americans poorer. As a cherry on top of the toxic NAFTA sundae, rampant illegal immigration continued unabated largely because the U.S. welfare system remains an attractive nuisance that draws foreign nationals who prefer America’s generous handouts to the blue-collar jobs in their own countries. This hollowing out of the American middle class continued every time Republicans and Democrats inked another “free trade deal” that made it easier for American companies to invest in slave labor overseas. As the cost of such deals became more widely apparent, the “ruling class” in D.C. became more inventive with its justifications. Bill Clinton opened up trade with communist China not because American companies could make a bundle from a workforce willing to work for subsistence wages, but rather because the introduction of Western commerce to China would be the camel’s nose under the communist tent. Globalization, in other words, was sold as a peaceful foreign policy that would make our adversaries more like us while avoiding military conflict and nuclear bluster. If blue jeans and the Beatles could collapse the Iron Curtain, then McDonald’s “Golden Arches” diplomacy would democratize communist China. At least that’s the hogwash Americans heard, as they watched their jobs move to the other side of the world. The costs for such foreign policy pipe dreams have been immense. Over three decades of “free trade deals,” Americans have lost millions of jobs, household savings have disappeared, the wealth gap between the top 1% and everyone else has significantly widened, drug- and alcohol-related deaths have skyrocketed, property theft and violent crime rates have steadily risen, and towns across the country have become rusted monuments to apathy and neglect. What did American workers get in exchange for so many lost jobs sent overseas? Nothing good. Once-important domestic companies have become multinational behemoths devoid of any sense of national allegiance. Moreover, as these companies have exponentially increased their wealth and global reach, they have also exponentially increased their influence over the foreign and domestic policy decisions of the U.S. government. (BlackRock, for example, set up shop in the Biden White House, and the corporate press mostly hid this inconvenient truth from the public.) China, a third-world nation three decades ago that could not feed its own citizens and seemed near collapse, has become a regional powerhouse with global reach. America, on the other hand, has crippled its own industrial and manufacturing self-sufficiency. In fact, it depends on China for critical pharmaceuticals, electronics components, metals, and finished products. “Golden Arches” diplomacy failed to democratize communist China. Instead, the U.S. government embraced the mass surveillance and censorship of its totalitarian adversary. Finally, a combination of catastrophically expensive “green energy” policies, profligate government spending, and economically unsound central bank money printing has set the United States down an untenable path toward runaway inflation, dollar destabilization, and financial ruin. Globalization, in other words, has left Americans poorer, more miserable, less optimistic about the future, and dangerously disconnected from their government. At the same time, their geopolitical enemies have never been more emboldened. That’s a gargantuan price tag for no reward.

Title: Joe Duffy’s Liveline can sound unmoored when not anchored by weighty subjects

As if the prospect of the clocks going back this weekend wasn’t enough of a jolt, Joe Duffy confuses matters further on Monday when he decides to push time in the opposite direction. “Everyone in Ireland, we’re all going forward 12 minutes,” he declares on Liveline (RTÉ Radio 1, weekdays), apparently proclaiming the kind of unilateral temporal adjustment usually reserved for Renaissance-era popes. Cue a fanfare of barely audible clanging bells. Anyone worried about the host’s sanity can relax, however. In his exaggeratedly jokey manner, Duffy is merely facilitating Bob, a caller who demonstrates the hourly chimes of his vintage clock by moving its hands forward, though the resulting peals lose their impact over the phone. It’s part of a meandering conversation prompted by the imminent move to winter time; it was sparked by another caller, Eithne, who for many years refused to change the clocks in her house. “I felt I was gaining an extra hour of daylight,” she says, taunting those listeners about to lose an hour of their life to the aimless chat that ensues. Quixotic attempts to make time stand still notwithstanding, Duffy’s focus is otherwise firmly fixed on the past, as he mines guests for the fond reminiscences about old Ireland that increasingly dominate slow days on Liveline. So Tom remembers gauging the passage of his work day in the 1960s by listening out for the Angelus – “Very few people had watches in those days,” he says – while Jimmy recounts how entire parishes voted against changing the clocks a century ago. It’s all harmless enough, and occasionally even entertaining. “Are you an expert in time?” Duffy asks Jimmy. “Indeed I’m not, only killing it,” comes the reply, in an impishly immaculate vernacular. But the segment has no point other than filling airtime, underlining how unmoored Liveline can sound when not anchored by weighty subjects. But when the host dons his consumer-affairs hat, proceedings really tip into caricature, as Duffy talks to callers outraged at high prices for food. Among them are Mary, who’s incredulous at being charged €9.80 for two sausage rolls at a hospital canteen, and Keith, who’s annoyed that he was asked to pay an additional €2.35 after ordering breakfast from the “extras” section of the menu at a Dublin Airport cafe. One doesn’t have to be in favour of endemic price-gouging in airports and hospitals, nor be unsympathetic to the irritation felt by captive customers, to wonder whether gripes over such small sums merit coverage on the national airwaves. Even the host seems slightly nonplussed at the irritation at times – “Is the clue in the word ‘extra’?” he gently inquires about Keith’s complaint – but he allows his callers to vent anyway. Duffy may not be able to control time, but when he’s dealing with material like this, 20 minutes can seem like an eternity. Looking back at times gone by doesn’t always have to involve a veil of gauzy nostalgia. For 14 years now Myles Dungan has brought intelligence and accessibility to episodes from the past on The History Show (RTÉ Radio 1, Sunday). And while Dungan, a historian in his own right, is adept at handling big historical events, such as the momentous independence struggles commemorated during Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries, he can also imbue niche areas with wider interest – an important skill for any broadcaster. Dungan’s interview with the University College Dublin academic Phyllis Gaffney is a case in point. Gaffney has just published a history of language teaching in Victorian Ireland, a subject that might be charitably viewed as specialist, but the discussion that follows is wide-ranging and unexpectedly fascinating. Among the themes covered are the francophone origins of Blackrock College, the traditional dominance of the classics in British universities – a legacy that has continued down to Boris Johnson, Dungan notes – and how the innovative foreign-language education of 19th-century Ireland has given way to monolinguism as English becomes globally ubiquitous. It’s an object lesson in transforming potentially arid topics into lively radio. Even still, the nation’s long fight for freedom, that evergreen golden oldie of Irish popular history, also features in the show. Ian Kenneally reports on how the Civil War killing of a Westmeath anti-Treaty IRA man by Free State forces inspired both a modern song and an old ballad, the latter so sentimentally partisan in its republican mythmaking that even the Wolfe Tones might regard it as a tad one-sided. Dungan also talks to the Australian author Thomas Keneally about the controversial Irish patriot John Mitchel, the subject of his latest historical novel, Fanatic Heart. As well as being proud of his Irish roots, the Booker-winning writer is a genuine literary A-lister, so his presence on the show represents a coup. But it’s no backslapping encounter. [ Unholy row – An Irishman’s Diary on John Mitchel and Archbishop John HughesOpens in new window ] Instead Dungan and Keneally robustly dissect the troubling life of Mitchel, the exiled Young Irelander firebrand who escaped from Tasmania to the United States, where he became an ardent defender of slavery, siding with the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Asked by the host why he chose to write about a figure “long outed as a white supremacist”, Keneally grapples with Mitchel’s vile prejudice, influenced by prevailing racist theories and his revulsion at US capitalism, while unequivocally condemning it: he describes slavery as “absolute human obscenity”. It’s a stimulating joust, with Dungan repeatedly asking about Mitchel’s damaged legacy, while Keneally tries to understand his subject’s contrarian nature and extreme temperament. The author also offers self-deprecating asides on how racist Victorian phrenologists would have viewed his own heritage. “I’ve got a weird head from north Cork,” he chuckles. “I’ve got a criminal skull.” Still, by the end, Mitchel’s reputation is so tarnished that Dungan is surely right to wonder if so many GAA clubs should still bear his name. It’s history at its most compelling, though it wouldn’t make you want to turn back time. Sign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research, MOFSL Gold prices steadied but were headed for a weekly gain, driven by safe-haven demand due to escalating geopolitical concerns. Israel’s military said yesterday it killed a Hamas commander who took part in the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel and also worked for the U.N. aid agency in the Gaza Strip. Uncertainty is also high ahead of U.S. Election Day on Nov. 5, with polls showing a tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. New applications for U.S. unemployment aid unexpectedly fell last week, but the number of people collecting benefits in mid-October was the highest in nearly three years, indicating it was becoming harder for those losing jobs to land new positions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has called jobs the most pressing global issue. She has also urged the World Bank to collaborate with countries to identify high-priority skilling sectors that generate employment. She was making intervention at the plenary lunch during the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank while speaking on the topic ‘How Should the World Bank Shape Its Future Strategic Direction and Help Clients Create More Jobs to Keep Pace with Evolving Megatrends.’” She emphasised that jobs are the most pressing global issue, given the continued economic headwinds and rapid technological change that are redefining the skills required for youth to enter the job market,” a social media post of Finance Ministry quoting Sitharaman said. Trading in Gift Nifty indicates a flat opening on Friday and another dull day for domestic markets. Amid mixed global cues, domestic benchmarks are expected to remain range-bound while action will be on the broader markets, said analysts. Stock-specific action will continue based on Q2-FY25 performance, they added. Dr Lal Pathlabs’ (DLPL) Q2-FY25 margins expanded by 110bps y-o-y on the back of improving contribution from Swasthfit and better margin performance at Suburban (about 600 bps q-o-q). Sample volume growth (+8.6 per cent y-o-y), however, remained soft owing to lower incidence of monsoon-related illnesses (except West region) and a higher base. Broadly, TVS Motor has reported bottom-line in line with estimates in Q2FY25 led by of sustenance of EBITDA margin at above 11 per cent level. Revenues increased by 13.3 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,228 crore (Vs estimate of ₹9,538 crore) on the back of 14.3 per cent y-o-y increase in volumes as ASPs declined by 0.9 per cent y-o-y. Coforge (₹7,699): The stock bounced off the 50-day moving average (DMA) this week and broke out of the resistance at ₹7,500. But note that ₹7,700 is a potential resistance. We retain our BUY rating and TP unchanged at Rs1,230 on Krystal Integrated Services (KIS), a rising leader in the Integrated Facilities Management Services (IFMS). The company’s quarterly performance aligns with our estimates and sets a strong foundation for future growth, also supported by new contract wins in H1FY25. These wins, along with Krystal’s expansion into promising verticals like MEP services, robotics, and AI-driven technical solutions, are poised to drive sustainable growth. The strategic partnership with Vishnu Prasad Research Centre to commercialize solid waste management technology further strengthens its competitive edge and coupled with growing demand in the catering business is a perfect recipe for solid growth. With reduced working capital days and a stable revenue mix, Krystal is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising opportunity in the IFMS services.

(NYSE:ANET) disclosed that Kelly Bodnar Battles, a member of its board of directors, has sold shares of the company's common stock. On October 22, Battles sold a total of 373 shares, generating approximately $147,888. The shares were sold at prices ranging from $393.8984 to $401.3 per share. Following these transactions, Battles retains direct ownership of 2,192 shares of Arista Networks.

In other recent news, Arista Networks has been making significant strides in its industry. The company has reported a robust Q2 performance, with revenues reaching $1.69 billion, indicating a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Goldman Sachs has maintained a Buy rating on Arista Networks, projecting the company to achieve approximately 20% revenue growth in 2024 and 2025. The firm's optimism is based on anticipated capital expenditure from Arista's major cloud customers, such as Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta's development of a massive new AI model training cluster. This could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Deutsche Bank also maintained its Hold rating, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. Recent developments also include Arista's repurchase of $172 million of its common stock and the generation of $989 million in operating cash. However, it's important to note that operating expenses increased to $319.8 million due to higher headcount and new product introduction costs. These are the latest updates in Arista Networks' ongoing business activities. Arista Networks' recent insider sale comes at a time when the company's stock is trading near its 52-week high, with InvestingPro data showing the price at 93.61% of its peak. This aligns with the strong performance reflected in the company's financials and market position. According to InvestingPro Tips, Arista Networks holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation. This strength is further underscored by the company's impressive revenue growth of 19.93% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, reaching $6.31 billion. The company's robust financial health is also evident in its profitability metrics. With an operating income margin of 41.23% and a gross profit margin of 64.01% for the same period, Arista Networks demonstrates efficient operations and strong pricing power in the competitive Communications Equipment industry. However, investors should note that the stock is trading at a high P/E ratio of 50.11, which may suggest a premium valuation. This is complemented by an InvestingPro Tip highlighting that Arista is trading at high EBIT and EBITDA valuation multiples. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips on Arista Networks, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and market position.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) will have its annual shareholders meeting on December 9 and those who are invested in the company will vote on a number of items, according to a Thursday filing by the Securities and Exchange Commission. One of the proposals up for a vote is the "Assessment of investing in Bitcoin," with the board recommending shareholders vote against it. It isn't clear whether the item refers to Microsoft putting Bitcoin, the industry's largest crypto, on its balance sheet. Microsoft did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. The filing also notes that "Microsoft's management already carefully considers this topic." Microsoft is one of the world's largest software companies and accepts Bitcoin from customers who are shopping online at its Windows and Xbox stores. If Microsoft does invest in Bitcoin, it will be one of the rare U.S. companies to do so. MicroStrategy, a software company that sells data-analyzing solutions, started buying Bitcoin back in 2020. The Tyson, Virginia-based firm is now the largest corporate holder of the crypto. With 252,220 Bitcoin, currently valued at $17 billion in reserves, its stock has surged this year alongside a rising Bitcoin price. Despite its success for shareholders, many public tech companies have yet to follow suit.

Jennifer Newstead, the Chief Legal Officer at Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), recently sold 905 shares of the company's Class A common stock. The shares were sold at a price of $574.7 each, totaling approximately $520,103. This transaction was executed under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which Newstead adopted on November 30, 2023. Following the sale, Newstead retains ownership of 32,387 shares in the company. In other recent news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. reported robust third-quarter profits and forecasted a 20-30% sales increase for the upcoming year. This positive projection spurred a rebound in the technology sector, with companies such as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) experiencing gains. Meanwhile, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)'s stock saw a decline due to its failure to meet revenue estimates for the third quarter. In analyst notes, JMP Securities maintained a Market Outperform rating for Meta Platforms Inc., indicating that the company's growth could surpass general Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expansion rates due to artificial intelligence (AI) enhancements and its substantial presence in the eCommerce sector. Additionally, TD Cowen and Mizuho Securities raised their price targets on Meta's shares, reflecting an optimistic outlook for the tech giant's performance. Meta Platforms Inc. has also seen significant legal developments. The company recently won a lawsuit over child safety disclosures, with U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer dismissing a shareholder lawsuit. On the technological front, Meta reintroduced its facial recognition technology to combat fraudulent advertisements and launched new artificial intelligence models, including a "Self-Taught Evaluator," which could reduce human involvement in the AI development process. These are all recent developments contributing to the evolving landscape of the company. While Jennifer Newstead's recent stock sale might raise eyebrows, it's crucial to contextualize this transaction within Meta Platforms' broader financial landscape. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a substantial market capitalization of $1.44 trillion, underscoring its position as a tech giant. The company's financial health appears robust, with an impressive revenue of $149.78 billion over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, representing a solid 24.28% growth. Meta's profitability metrics are particularly noteworthy. The company maintains a high gross profit margin of 81.49%, indicating strong pricing power and efficient cost management. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting Meta's "impressive gross profit margins." Additionally, Meta's P/E ratio of 28.17 suggests that while the stock isn't cheap, it's not excessively valued considering its growth prospects. Another InvestingPro Tip points out that Meta "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet," which speaks to the company's financial stability and flexibility. This strong financial position may provide reassurance to investors concerned about insider selling activities. For those seeking a deeper dive into Meta's financial health and market position, InvestingPro offers 16 additional tips, providing a comprehensive analysis for informed investment decisions.

Title: TSMC reports early success at first U.S. chip plant
URL: https://qz.com/tsmc-us-chip-fab-ahead-comparable-taiwan-arizona-apple-1851680813
Time Published: 2024-10-24T21:46:00Z
Full Content:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM) first U.S. chip fabrication facility is reportedly ahead of some of the ones back home. The company’s chip production yields — or the number of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — at its Phoenix, Arizona site are about four percentage points higher than those of comparable fabs in Taiwan, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed person who was part of a webinar with TSMC’s U.S. division president Rick Cassidy. It’s a positive sign for the chipmaker as it shows production could possibly offset the multi-billion dollar cost of its stateside chip hub. TSMC has faced delays at planned facilities in Arizona due to a shortage of skilled workers. The two additional factories at the hub are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028. In April, the Biden administration announced that TSMC is eligible for up to $6.6 billion in grants through the federal CHIPS and Science Act, as well as up to $5 billion in loans to support its U.S. hub. Some of the anticipated funding will support building a third facility. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz. C.C. Wei, chief executive of TSMC, said on a call with investors last week that its first U.S. fab “entered engineering wafer production in April with 4-nanometer process technology and the result is highly satisfactory, with a very good yield,” Bloomberg reported. This process is among the most advanced chip manufacturing methods currently in commercial production. “This is an important operational milestone for TSMC and our customers, demonstrating TSMC’s strong manufacturing capability and execution,” Wei said. The Taiwanese chipmaker has reportedly begun manufacturing chips for Apple, its first customer at the Arizona fab, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported in September, citing unnamed sources. The A16 chips are being produced “in small, but significant, numbers,” Culpan said. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Tesla Stock Is on Track for its Best Day in a Decade

Tesla (TSLA) stock notched its best day in more than a decade on Thursday after the electric vehicle maker topped earnings estimates and promised a lower-cost model would begin production early next year. Tesla shares soared 22% Thursday, their biggest one-day gain since May 2013 when the company reported $500 million in quarterly sales for the first time. In the most recent quarter, vehicle sales exceeded $20 billion. Tesla's surging stock lifted the S&P 500's Automobiles Industry Index, which advanced more than 18% Thursday. Shares of other automakers were mixed, with General Motors (GM) slipping and Ford (F) advancing. Uber (UBER) shares slid nearly 2%; its stock surged to a record high earlier this month when Tesla's robotaxi rollout failed to convince investors it posed a threat to the ride-sharing giant. The company on Wednesday night reported automotive profit margins improved for the first time since early 2022. The profitability of the company’s core car business has been under pressure for years amid a price war in China and sluggish U.S. demand. CEO Elon Musk assured analysts on the company’s earnings call that “plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.” Musk has long said a lower-cost model is on the way, but his enthusiasm this year for robotaxis and AI has raised doubts on Wall Street about his commitment to that plan. Musk outlined other ambitious goals for Tesla on the call, including making it the world’s most valuable company “by a long shot” and achieving “vehicle growth” of 20% to 30% next year. Tesla’s total car sales are down 2% so far this year compared with 2023. Update—Oct. 24, 2024: This story was updated after markets closed on Thursday to reflect Tesla's closing share price.

Title: Snap's SWOT analysis: stock outlook amid AI push and ad market shifts

Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP)., the company behind the popular social media app Snapchat, finds itself at a critical juncture as it navigates a rapidly evolving digital landscape. The company has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) while working to improve its advertising capabilities. However, Snap faces challenges in user growth and intense competition in the digital advertising space. In a bid to boost user engagement and attract new users, Snap recently introduced "Simple Snapchat," a redesigned app interface that consolidates features into three main tabs: Chat, Snap, and Watch. This streamlined approach aims to make the app more intuitive and open up new advertising opportunities across all consumer surfaces, including previously under-monetized areas like Chat. The company has also been making significant progress in its AR initiatives. Snap showcased the 5th generation of Spectacles AR glasses, primarily targeting developers to enhance its AR ecosystem. This move positions Snap as a potential leader in the nascent AR hardware market, although the consumer adoption of such devices remains uncertain. Snap's investment in AI is evident in its partnership with OpenAI and the introduction of generative AI tools in Lens Studio. These advancements are designed to simplify AR content creation and potentially increase user-generated content on the platform. Snap has been focusing on improving its direct response (DR) advertising capabilities, a crucial area for revenue growth. The company has introduced new ad formats such as Sponsored Snaps and improved targeting using data from Snap Maps. These efforts are aimed at attracting more small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to the platform and increasing ad revenue. The company may also benefit from the current uncertainties surrounding TikTok. Some analysts estimate that Snap could potentially capture about 5% of TikTok's advertising budgets if spend is reduced due to various scenarios, including a potential ban. This could translate to an additional $100 million in revenue for Snap. Snap's financial performance has been a mixed bag, with the company showing potential for growth but facing challenges in consistently meeting market expectations. In 2023, Snap reported revenues of $4,606.1 million, with projections for 2024 and 2025 at $5,375.1 million and $6,212.3 million, respectively. EBITDA figures are also expected to improve, with estimates of $440.2 million for 2024 and $804.0 million for 2025, up from $161.6 million in 2023. Analysts have varying outlooks on Snap's future performance. While some firms maintain a positive stance due to the company's potential for growth and unique offerings, others express caution due to execution risks and competitive pressures. Snap operates in a highly competitive digital advertising market, facing off against giants like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). However, the company has carved out a niche with its focus on privacy-centric messaging and AR capabilities. Snap's strong engagement with younger demographics, particularly teens and Gen Z, provides a valuable proposition for advertisers looking to reach these hard-to-capture audiences. The company's unique position in AR and its potential to expand into other social verticals leveraging its deep location-based data sets it apart from competitors. However, Snap must continue to innovate and improve its ad products to compete effectively for advertising budgets. One of the primary concerns for Snap is its ability to continue growing its user base, particularly in developed markets where it may be approaching saturation. The company's Daily Active Users (DAUs) stood at 414 million as of the latest report, but there are concerns about the Total Addressable Market (TAM) in mature markets. Snap's user growth has been primarily driven by international markets, while growth in North America has slowed. The company needs to find new ways to attract and retain users in developed markets to maintain its appeal to advertisers and justify its valuation. Despite improvements in its advertising technology, Snap still faces significant competition from larger, more established platforms with more extensive user bases and more robust advertising ecosystems. The company's ability to capture a larger share of advertising budgets, particularly from SMBs, remains uncertain. Snap's relatively smaller scale compared to competitors like Meta and Google could make it challenging to provide the same level of targeting and reach that advertisers expect. The company needs to continue innovating in its ad products and demonstrate superior ROI to advertisers to compete effectively. Snap's investments in AI and AR could be significant drivers of future growth and user engagement. The company's AI-powered features, such as My AI and AI-enhanced lenses, have the potential to make the platform more attractive to users and increase time spent on the app. In the AR space, Snap's Spectacles and Lens Studio position the company as a leader in this emerging technology. As AR becomes more mainstream, Snap could benefit from its early mover advantage and deep expertise in this area. The integration of AR into advertising could also open up new revenue streams and differentiate Snap's offering to advertisers. Snap's introduction of new ad formats like Sponsored Snaps and improvements in targeting capabilities using Snap Maps data could significantly boost the company's advertising revenue. These innovations allow for more seamless integration of ads into the user experience and potentially higher engagement rates. The company's focus on improving its direct response advertising capabilities could also attract more SMB advertisers to the platform, diversifying its advertiser base and potentially increasing ad spend. If Snap can demonstrate superior ROI for these new ad formats and targeting capabilities, it could lead to increased ad budgets allocated to the platform. Snap Inc. continues to navigate a challenging digital advertising landscape while pushing forward with innovative features and technologies. The company's focus on AI and AR could provide significant growth opportunities, but it must overcome user growth challenges and intense competition to realize its full potential. As Snap works to improve its advertising capabilities and expand its user base, investors and analysts will be closely watching its ability to execute on these strategies and deliver consistent financial results. This analysis is based on information available up to October 24, 2024, and reflects the views and projections of various analysts and financial institutions at that time.

Title: As activist Starboard engages constructively, here’s a potent prescription for Pfizer’s future success under Dr. Bourla’s watch

Last week, we stood in support of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla, responding to unfounded attacks on him in the media from anonymous sources, and we expressed our initial skepticism about aspects of Starboard Value’s activist position in our Fortune column. This was fortified by a meticulously detailed, original 36-page research slide deck. We received thunderous positive feedback—and many experts joined us in questioning the activist assault on Pfizer. That chorus of public skepticism grew louder after Starboard’s Jeff Smith presented his highly-anticipated slide deck yesterday during a special CNBC interview with David Faber and at Ken Squire’s 13D Conference, with critics noting it contained a lengthy case for change but few remedies or solutions. However, what we noted was a subtle shift in Starboard’s approach, with Smith asserting “We’re excited about what’s there… and we think the future [of Pfizer] will be better than people think.” He refused to be baited into calling overtly for CEO change, declaring “I don’t know why we need to be nasty. We like to work with everybody [there]”. Smith is right: Pfizer’s future, under Dr. Bourla’s leadership, could indeed be much brighter than many expect. Here’s how Dr. Bourla is already well on his way toward getting Pfizer back on track—as well as the next steps Pfizer needs to take to turbocharge its prescription for success. As Smith accurately pointed out yesterday, Pfizer’s stock is trading at a historically depressed valuation (low multiple of 10x earnings), largely the result of low expectations from Wall Street analysts and investors for Pfizer’s future growth. A series of high-profile recent misses over the last two years—ranging from COVID-19 vaccine demand collapsing faster than Pfizer expected to capital allocation concerns with a slump in sales of Nurtec after Pfizer acquired the migraine drug from Biohaven for ~$11.6 billion to the recall of Oxbryta after Pfizer acquired the sickle cell disease drug from GBT for ~$5.4 billion to setbacks in GLP-1 drug development—hasn’t helped. As a result of these setbacks, as Smith pithily noted, “investors and analysts just don’t believe that [Pfizer] is going to produce what they hoped to produce…but for sure, those [low expectations] aren’t right. Could Pfizer do better? Of course.” Smith is correct: Not only could Pfizer prove these low expectations wrong but it also appears Pfizer is already back on track operationally and poised to raise the bar significantly. Investors and analysts should be paying much closer attention to at least three key near-term revenue drivers that they are currently underappreciating. First and foremost, much of Pfizer’s future comes down to whether or not its bet-the-farm, transformative $43 billion acquisition of Seagen will pay off, especially since the Seagen acquisition was bigger than all of Pfizer’s other recent acquisitions combined. Analysts were bearish on the Seagen deal from the outset, and that hasn’t really changed, but the facts are that the returns on investment from Seagen so far are surpassing even the most optimistic expectations, as we describe in more depth in our 36-page slide deck. If anything, with flagship cancer drug PADCEV continuing to outperform, it looks like Pfizer may have gotten a steal and underpaid for Seagen, paying one of the smallest acquisition premiums of any recent comparable pharma. Second, while migraine drug Nurtec got off to a slow start, this was fully expected and anticipated by Pfizer management, who expected it would take at least a year to plug it into a very different distribution, staffing, and marketing system. But now, thanks in part to proactive advice from the highly respected Biohaven team, which remains highly incentivized financially to ensure Nurtec succeeds, sales have re-accelerated in recent quarters, and the drug seems to be well on its way towards becoming one of the blockbuster drugs (generating at least $1 billion in annual sales) in the crown jewels of Pfizer’s portfolio. Furthermore, Pfizer retains further upside optionality around oral Nurtec candidates still in the research and development (R&D) pipeline. Third, the COVID-19 vaccine franchise may be showing promising signs of stabilization after Pfizer dramatically overestimated vaccine demand last year, with many expecting earnings beats and upward revisions from resurgent waves of COVID-19 around the world, especially with many contracts set to re-price. At a minimum, Pfizer is likely now past rock bottom in vaccine demand. Even beyond Pfizer’s operational misses over the last two years, another key reason why Wall Street has such low expectations for Pfizer’s future growth may be because, plainly, they have little understanding of Pfizer’s pipeline, little visibility into what might hit and when, and what Pfizer’s own outlook is moving forward. As some analysts have aptly observed, “There is a lot of value to be unlocked across vaccines, oncology, and obesity, but the Street is unsure of what it will take to move shares higher or get investors to own the stock”. Dr. Bourla is already well on his way towards getting Pfizer back on track operationally—but the more pressing challenge for Pfizer at this point may be in communicating their story more proactively and attractively to the investment community. In the near term, upcoming quarterly earnings calls will be crucial opportunities to provide detailed updates on the successes of the Seagen, Nurtec, and COVID-19 franchises; but all eyes will be on earnings guidance provided for 2025. Analyst expectations are low, and some seem to think an earnings-per-share (EPS) forecast in the ~$2.75 – $3.00 range would go a long way towards restoring investor faith and management credibility. Furthermore, Pfizer can reclaim the narrative when it comes to capital allocation by reiterating its commitment to shareholder returns, not only through its ~6% dividend but also by defining the prospect of potential share repurchases down the road. In the longer term, it’s hard to see any downside to hosting an R&D Day that provides investors with a better understanding of the vaunted Pfizer pipeline, which is widely considered to be best-in-class but may not be priced adequately into Pfizer’s valuation due to investors and analysts having little visibility. Alternatively, an Investor Day could help clarify catalysts for a potential re-rating of the stock. These don’t have to be progress on a potential GLP-1 drug. Yes, GLP-1 companies such as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are having their moment, but the see-saw swings of the pharmaceuticals stock market are notoriously fickle. After all, those now-soaring stocks looked weak during the pandemic for having missed the COVID-19 vaccine boom. If there is an eventual market regime shift away from the exclusive focus on GLP-1s and toward any of a number of emerging fields within pharma with a large total addressable market, such as oncology, vaccines, or neurological drugs, Pfizer would be uniquely well positioned to benefit with deep, durable pipelines in each of those fields. Not all activist engagements are alike. We have never hesitated to call out misguided activists when they fall into bullying and bluster—and have advocated strongly against over-the-top activist assaults at Disney, Norfolk Southern, DuPont, and many other companies. However, we also enthusiastically celebrate activists when they work constructively to drive greater shareholder returns and defend them from unfair attacks. In this case, we’ve been vocal in our skepticism about certain aspects of Starboard Value’s activist campaign against Pfizer, but just as we called out the misleading ad hominem attacks on Dr. Bourla that some anonymous sources blundered into previously we also find recent ad hominem attacks on Jeff Smith by anonymous sources in the media to be deeply unfair. Unwarranted and inaccurate anonymous hatchet whispers that Starboard’s launch was “the worst first week in an activist campaign in the history of Wall Street” are just too much. At a minimum, Starboard—and Smith—deserve much more credit than what has been accorded so far for their relentless focus on driving investment returns at Pfizer, and for taking a constructive, savvy approach since meeting with management last week. Similarly, critics unfairly bemoaned what they perceived to be a loss of credibility for Starboard after former Pfizer CEO Ian Read and CFO Frank D’Amelio apparently switched sides, but as we explained previously, we believe Read’s excessive cost-cutting approach left Pfizer’s pipeline depleted, and left deep challenges for Bourla to clean up. Perhaps Starboard could do without the occasional asides about removing CEOs at other companies, which ended up getting misquoted and misconstrued into highly disrespectful, unwarranted, and premature calls for Bourla’s removal. Nevertheless, as Pfizer shareholders ourselves with small positions, and knowing and respecting both sides, we objectively, independently, hope and believe Smith’s encouragingly constructive engagement could potentially turn into a positive for all involved. Listening to activist investors can be a chore for many management teams and boards, who tend to think of activists as massive distractions taking them away from the business of actually running their enterprises or attention-hungry gadflies who merely take credit for changes already underway. While these critiques are not without truth, the savviest leaders know how to leverage activist involvement to accelerate turnarounds. There can be nothing quite as effective as the specter barbarians at the gates to rally employees, sharpen organizational focus, and accelerate changes that may otherwise be hard to pull off. Pfizer’s board needs no prodding, as they have shown their responsiveness to shareholders by having two of its three largest shareholders represented on the board, through State Street CEO Cyrus Taraporevala, the recent addition of former Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley, alongside other stars such as Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey and former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb. Pfizer is already getting back on track, but an even more potent prescription for success could be in the cards for the pharmaceutical giant under Dr. Albert Bourla’s continued leadership.

Title: Tesla's Surprise Earnings Beat
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/24/teslas-surprise-earnings-beat/
Time Published: 2024-10-24T16:00:58Z

This photograph shows the logo of US company "Tesla" displayed at the Paris Motor Show at Paris Expo ... [+] Porte de Versailles in Paris on October 16, 2024. (Photo by JULIEN DE ROSA / AFP) (Photo by JULIEN DE ROSA/AFP via Getty Images) Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted a better-than-expected set of Q3 2024 earnings. Revenue for the quarter rose 8% year-over-year to $25.18 billion a year earlier, while net income was up almost 17% to $2.17 billion. The earnings beat and commentary from CEO Elon Musk indicating that volume growth for next year could be much stronger sent the stock up by close to 12% in after-hours trading. Notably, much of the upside came from regulatory credit sales and Tesla’s often-overlooked energy business. A couple of factors have driven Tesla's earnings bump. Deliveries for the quarter rose by about 6.4% compared to last year to 462,890 vehicles, marking the company's first quarter of growth in 2024. Average selling prices continued to trend lower, coming in at under $40,700 for Q3, down almost $1,000 compared to the previous quarter as price cuts, weaker product mix for the mainstream S, X, Y and 3 models, as well as highly discounted financing options. Now a bulk of Tesla's earnings lift came from the sales of about $739 million in automotive regulatory credits. As an EV manufacturer, Tesla earns regulatory credits that it can sell to traditional automotive manufacturers who are unable to meet government-mandated zero-emission vehicle sales targets. These credit sales, which we estimate are almost pure profit, are likely to have been a key driver of margins for the quarter. Gross margins for automotive sales stood at 16.4%, up from 15.7% in the year-ago quarter likely driven by lower costs, better scale and higher revenue recognition relating to fully self-driving software. Read more about Tesla's recent troubles in China. Tesla's Energy business, which includes energy storage products and solar energy systems, was a bright spot. In Q3, revenue rose 52% to $2.38 billion, driven by strong Powerwall deployments and progress in scaling the latest Powerwall 3 and the Lathrop Megafactory. Storage deployments grew 75% year-over-year, and profitability too improved, with gross margin hitting a record 30.5%, up from 24% a year ago. The Shanghai Megafactory is on track to start shipping Megapacks in Q1 2025, which could further boost sales. Demand for energy storage solutions is expected to grow alongside increased installations of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Overall, the performance of TSLA stock with respect to the index over the last 4-year period has been quite volatile. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -65% in 2022, and 102% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could TSLA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We maintain our view that Tesla will be a big beneficiary of the long-term transition to cleaner transportation and energy generation, given its well-oiled supply chain, superior battery, and drive-train technologies, and its lead with car software and self-driving technology. That said, the company's overall deliveries are facing pressure, falling well below the company's multi-year target of 50% annual growth in deliveries. A lack of extensive charging networks in many countries, and falling resale values for EVs are likely discouraging potential buyers in the interim. However, Tesla's CEO indicates that 20% to 30% delivery growth next year is a possibility. Tesla could also see some upside from its robo-taxi business. While the company unveiled the new cabs earlier this month, it intends to officially roll out ridesharing in Texas and California sometime next year and this could also drive growth, given the massive size of the ride-sharing market. Learn more about the robo-taxi business Waymo Is Worth $5 Trillion For Alphabet Stock. We value Tesla stock at $240 per share, which is roughly in line with Thursday's pre-market price of $239 per share.

Title: Happy / Death / Day

Time Published: 2024-10-24T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
i. I wake up and once I muster the energy, I watch the person in the mirror move her mouth and tongue, shaped over time like I and then am and then not and then a and then commodity. Her hair needs washed and her tits are whatever, but there’s something in her eyes. Bleary, blessed. At first she thought it was the other way around, but now she thinks she’s finally got it: the price of being seen is being able to see. The way people often talk about their Genders, as boujee and bespoke Tamagotchi made only for cradling, is enough to give her cavities. The way people often talk about Genre, as the obnoxious echo of distorted tropes and franchise potential, is enough to give her ulcers. It’s not the labels that rot her human teeth, not the categories that eat through her human stomach, but the sacrine language the taxonomy, and thus the taxonomy’s power, are birthed from. Instinct and expectation come from someplace, and that place is not always your body, your heart, your head. Gender and Genre are modalities you buy into. The chick in the mirror is bored to tears of metaphor, but even she has to admit it is not, strictly speaking, useless. If close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, Genre only counts in bookstores and awards shows. Gender is not the tree, nor the tree falling, nor the sound it may or may not make, depending on what is at the center of our imaginations, our definitions of Witness. Rather, if you have to say it is anything, Gender is the entire ecosystem of which that tree is a part, the woods you walk through, get lost in, calmly or in terror. i. I promise you already know the premise of Happy Death Day, even if you’ve never heard of it. It’s an ironic time loop slasher movie, Scream by way of Groundhog Day. The movie hinges on the set-up being so simple that its possibilities are already alive and growing inside you, the viewer, buried but benign in your narrative gut, an inevitable biological reaction to the media it expects us all to have consumed. Jessica Rothe plays Tree Gelbman, a bitchy slut attending Bayfield University who wakes up hungover on her birthday, September 18th, in the dormroom of random classmate Carter (played by Israel Broussard). As she goes about her day, we see her act as the kind of woman we expect her to be. We see that she is thin and blonde and pretty and so we see that she is snarky, cruel, dismissive. Tree actively antagonizes everyone around her, she stands her father up at a lunch he arranged to commemorate her late mother, and we see that she is having an affair with her married science professor. At the end of the night, on the way to her surprise party, Tree is stabbed to death by someone wearing a mask based on the school’s mascot, The Bayfield Baby. She wakes up back in Carter’s room, eventually realizing she’s stuck in a loop and will need to repeatedly die in order to figure out who’s killing her and somehow break the cycle. Happy Death Day knows what you’re thinking, knows all the ways you’ve been trained to evaluate the characters and situations it presents. It communes with the aforementioned cyst inside you, the one brought on by years of lampshading and meta commentary and American culture’s chronic misunderstanding of satire. The movie is better than it has any right to be because it understands not just its audiences’ expectations, but its audiences’ relationship with those expectations, what they hope to see and understand about the world through the deconstruction of empty cyphers, conduits whose static meaning was decided long ago. In this context, Tree is a revelation. Screenwriter Scott Lobdell remixes these tropes in order to give Rothe the freedom to explore her incredibly thorough, dynamic performance. Because her repeated death acts as a visceral metaphor for her journey toward betterment (an unsubtle symbol of her past not just haunting but hunting her), and because the film’s narrative relies so heavily on the viewer’s understanding of genre conventions, Tree’s emotional development is inexorably tied not just to her navigation of the plot, but her navigation of how those watching her die understand the slasher genre more broadly. It’s a rare example of structural gimmickry that serves something beyond self-indulgence, punitive brutality, or lazy writing. Here, the multiple levels of elaborate subversion act as an argument for Tree’s genuine humanity, playing with how audiences have come to understand mean girl characters, as well as the larger, more pressing fact that mean girl characters aren’t real. Tree may not be a “good” person, but she is also not a person, period. She’s a character, one part of her larger predetermined world, a set of motives and mannerisms and aesthetic signifiers embodied by a talented actress trying to tell you a story. It’s a complex role that Rothe succeeds in making feel seamless. She’s tasked with being the campy liaison cum medium for the bitch Tree acts like diegetically, the character she’s presented as non-diegetically, and the woman she actually is that the audience can only glimpse in slivers past these other personas. Tree is not aware that she’s in a horror movie, but she knows where the walls are, is familiar with the dusty frankness of their limits. Her awareness is constant, jagged. She knows she’s stuck in something arbitrary, arresting, and fundamentally unreal, even before the time loop stuff begins. i. Whatshername in the mirror is sick to death of looking at my face. I mean really, how many trees fall of their own accord? Odds are it was felled by something, a sharp split or a groaning machine. And besides, I use pieces of my body to build things all the time. Saying I’m a woman scares me because I take words themselves too seriously. Some piece of me still wants to believe itself immune to propaganda, and so I always find a reason to remain skeptical of the notion that preciousness is the enemy of play, that nothing ever gets found out if you’re afraid to fuck around. Saying I’m a woman scares me because choosing life necessitates insistence, and insistence necessitates a level of self-possession whose dibs I usually see called by broods of annoying white women. I guess this is what people talk about when they talk about social conditioning, representation, the porn with which you’re able to touch yourself being reflected back in your mind’s I, like annihilation is cool, like the most femme thing you can do is be hung. To be a baddie, you have to be a human first, and I’m not sure I’ve made it even that far. I don’t think I’ve figured out how to Want something, not really, not yet. I don’t know where Want comes from, if the shapes it takes are the result of boundaries or stencils. At the very least, I know there are many names for cowardice. If the faculty of touch is indeed a static, limited version of sight, you can spend your whole life caressing walls and pinching pennies to buy boots to shield your unstubbed toes. You can prostrate yourself to the electric flashes of every almostroom in the abyss of your shut eyes, an army of brief figments, there and gone again. i. The worst parts of Happy Death Day are the moments of emotional exposition, the scenes where playing with Genre conventions requires the movie to have Tree sit across from a man and explain her grief. The backstory about her mother’s passing is as thin and generic as the rest of the film’s narrative particulars, but the rug has to exist before it can be pulled out from under the viewer. One of the film’s best inversions, a plot point that the sequel would go on to ruin, is that Tree’s predicament is both unexplained and unrelated to any convenient metaphors of morality or closure. Her birthday, the time loop, and the murders have nothing to do with each other. Tree doesn’t live to see September 19th because she learns to be nice or because she’s finally able to process her mother’s death, but because she finds out who keeps killing her and stops them from doing so. The movie makes it clear this hasn’t really been a journey toward betterment, because those kinds of tidy arcs don’t exist. They’re cozy abstractions, stories we plaster over reality after the fact, myths canonized through relentless dissemination. As a character, Tree works best when she’s somewhat hidden, all but drowned out by the movie’s predictable sound and fury. If we were ever able to peel back the tropes and see her as herself, she would be unremarkable, banal to the point of discomfort. Her abrasiveness is played so arch that it belies a sense of desperate sadness that writhes under the surface of her engagement with everything, staying just this side of the film’s breezy horror-comedy framing. Tree is a character Theresa Gelbman puts on to cope with a personal kind of melancholy that has rapidly outgrown the trite conventions of the world around her, a character that is both intimate and exaggerated, both herself and not. Beyond the meta pyrotechnics, Tree is just a young woman who is depressed and lonely and made to strut through a world built on cultural legacies that have nothing to do with her. In this way, she is the perfect horror heroine for the late-2010s: dissociative, repressed, driven to near insanity and an act three Buffy impersonation by the patterns and expectations of the ones watching her on the other side of the screen. When she first encounters her Baby Mask Killer, they are standing motionless at the mouth of a dark tunnel, staring at her. When Tree’s Can-I-help-yous fail, we see her shift her stance before replying in-character: “Look, weirdo. I’m not scared. Why don’t you go try this with one of the heifers at Delta Gamma? They’re into cosplay.” It is not so much the joke that hits, but the moment of silence afterward, the panic that crawls across her face, the whimper of hesitation as Tree realizes that she might be about to get actually, physically hurt, that playing her part isn’t enough to spare her from what that part’s ultimate fate was always designed to be. A movie with a less compelling lead might have been hobbled by how flat Tree’s family backstory falls, but Rothe elevates the film by never losing sight of what’s actually going on with her character and the heightened world she’s a part of. Happy Death Day is a movie about grief and futility, but importantly, it is not a movie about what Tree has lost or what she cannot achieve. The artifice is the point: the film is concerned not with the minutiae of what caused her despair or how she can move past it, but the mechanics of what she builds to navigate it. After all, it’s a dumb slasher movie. Nothing in her world was made to hold the weight of real Horror: she herself is barely keeping up among all the histrionic cardboard. Happy Death Day is a minor film with a minor point to make, but “pleasant surprise” is still a synonym for “miracle”. i. Enough with the mirror shit, the doubling, the chick with the mouth: you eject into the third person because distance makes “idolatry” easier to spell. There is no silver lining. There is the sun and there is a cloud and there is a You occupying a position that lets you decide that one’s movement in front of the other is a comfortable omen. If all language is metaphor, then pronouns are just mouth sounds that make making other mouth sounds more convenient, no more a part of you than the stitches of fabric you wear are your actual physical body. Trans people talk all the time about cracking eggs but what the fuck do I know about making omelets? I’ve convinced everyone I’ve ever slept with to cook for me by taking on all the menial, in-between stuff, the dishes and the driving. I have fed myself with my inability to feed myself. I have feasted on the strength I convinced myself it takes to starve with elegance. By which I mean I am old enough now to have survived what my younger self believed was her only Want. I am old enough now that I don’t want the obvious to be true. I don’t want decay to be the only method by which I can trace these structures, don’t want to be aware of my contours only as they disintegrate. The wind doesn’t give a fuck about how you style that skirt you thrifted. The water couldn’t care less about how fucked up your eyeliner is or how bad you think you look in selfies. Your hatred will not save you, no matter where it’s pointed. Death and I aren’t even tight like that, so what are we even talking about? Besides, all this handwringing assumes a perpetual future. There is a temptation to believe that, like the inconsequential control of a lucid dream, there is freedom to be found in resurrection, in being able to come back and come back, in knowing you are just one version of yourself. But I suspect liberation is allergic to the negative definition, the gentrified self-actualization of knowing what you don’t want to be. I suspect the privilege of all our extra lives is a curse, something that looms and darkens the sky over our every choice. It is not so much about growth, about what each iteration of yourself is able to accomplish, but about the fact that you will never be able to experience those developments because change changes you. You are never yourself. You are always searching. In this way, sadness is the price of admission because grief, nostalgia, yearning, is the sonar you use to walk around. There is power in that orienting echo, power in reaching for what you Want. I am not above putting opossum stickers on my insulated cocoon, not above forgetting the sun is the same sun everywhere. But I feel the cutest when I, however briefly, remember that sadness is not always sad, when I trust my senses not as evidence of the Real World, of my Real Self, but as evidence of my experience of my senses. This is not nihilism, pedantry, unbelief. On the contrary, it is a deep, devoted Love, one that opens me up. I suspect that on a molecular level, everything is a verb. If a tree falls then the bitch falls, so what? The critters and the creeping plant life will make a snazzy third place out of its once mighty stretch, and we’ll have another ending to add to the pile. There is always a bigger structure to consider, a trope to be subverted, an expectation to play with. Breaking the fourth wall does not count as dismantling anything. At some point, that which is flammable must burn. To choose life is to accept that some things are realer than real, and that sometimes the realest thing is what we imagine for ourselves. I start friendly debates about Trans Materialism with the sexy robots that fill my inbox with spam. They’ve taught me a lot about how exactly to wear a face, how to use my debit card’s genome to step into who I really am. I too can misuse the term “cunty” and worship anything that winks at me. I too can get high after work and baptize these skinny white starlets in my eager drool. I too can follow another meme page and trick out everything I own in cutesy pride colorways whose creators can’t afford rent. Transgression, after all, depends on curves, courtesy, color, comfort, contrivance, context. The inside parts of me make themselves known like the soft fuzz of cut wood. When a tree falls, scion or psyop, the faggots weep. i. If there is one thing I know I Want, it’s for Happy Death Day 2U to have not been so terrible. Christopher Landon, now taking on writing duties in addition to reprising his role as director, decided to completely switch genres for the sequel, making the movie a time travel/multiverse sci-fi comedy with a few token slasher set pieces sprinkled in. If the film had been a worthy successor, the metaphor would’ve worked perfectly: whatever existential gender questions I saw reflected in Tree’s attrition would become a more obvious part of the series’ meta text as it literally transitions, becoming something new. Unfortunately, Happy Death Day 2U never figures out how to properly deal with the inherent problems of trying to expand on the insipid, deliberately cliché narrative setting of the original film. After a solid 30 minutes of different fake-outs riffing on bad sequel tropes, eventually we find out that the time loop was caused by a side character’s thesis project, a timey wimey macguffin called the Sisyphus Quantum Cooling Reactor (Sissy for short) that sends Tree back in time to relive another September 18th loop, this time in an alternate dimension, one where her mother is alive. Not only must she figure out how to break the cycle again and get home, but she must decide which dimension “home” really is. Happy Death Day 2U doesn’t have plot holes so much as it operates in the smoldering craters where plot once was. It’s the kind of movie that makes less and less sense the more you try to work with it, meet it where it’s at. This is partially because the rules for these kinds of sci-fi plots are often more complicated and narratively singular than time loop stories tend to be, so they don’t lend themselves as well to the kind of measured thematic chicanery that made the first movie so satisfying. Plus, even with new faces and new roles to play, none of the other characters even threaten to become compelling, and with so much of the film spent trying to bolster the auxiliary stuff, Tree doesn’t get anything to do either. Rothe still delights when she can (like in her montage of pop-backed slapstick suicides, a structural joke borrowed from the first movie), but the film has no real interest in her interiority, so everything else crumbles accordingly. Honestly, the only interesting thing about Happy Death Day 2U is how thoroughly its mid-credits gag undermines everything about itself and its predecessor. After an astonishingly slap-dash last 15 minutes involving one of the characters pretending to be a blind exchange student named Amelie Le Pew, followed by Lizzo’s commissioned-for-the-movie girlboss cover of “Stayin’ Alive” (“You can tell by the way I use my walk I’m a wo-man”), we see Tree and her fleet of nerdy stock characters conducting community service as penance for their shenanigans. As they pick up litter, the gang is swarmed by secret service vehicles and escorted to a DARPA laboratory, where a Black agent explains that the government has acquired Sissy and is recruiting them to help the military figure out how to weaponize it. Carter points out that actively trapping people in time loops is “messed up”, but a sideways look from the agent makes him hastily add “Unless they deserve it”. Tree’s eyes widen with epiphany as she tells everyone she thinks she has “the perfect recruit”. We cut to Danielle, one of her bitchy sorority sisters who cheated on Carter in an alternate dimension, as she wakes up screaming.

Title: Intel's former CEO tried to buy Nvidia almost 2 decades ago

Tech pioneer Intel (INTC) has seemingly missed out on the artificial intelligence boom — and part of it can reportedly be traced back to a decision not to buy the chipmaker at the center of it all almost two decades ago. Intel’s former chief executive Paul Otellini wanted to buy Nvidia in 2005 when the chipmaker was mostly known for making computer graphics chips, which some executives thought had potential for data centers, The New York Times (NYT) reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. However, Intel’s board did not approve of the $20 billion acquisition — which would’ve been the company’s most expensive yet — and Otellini dropped the effort, according to The New York Times. Instead, the board was reportedly more interested in an in-house graphics project called Larrabee, which was led by now-chief executive Pat Gelsinger. Almost two decades later, Nvidia (NVDA) has become the second-most valuable public company in the world and continuously exceeds Wall Street’s high expectations. Intel, on the other hand, has seen its shares fall around 53% so far this year and is now worth less than $100 billion — around 30 times less than Nvidia’s $3.4 trillion market cap. In August, Intel shares fell 27% after it missed revenue expectations with its second-quarter earnings and announced layoffs. The company missed profit expectations partly due to its decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. And Nvidia wasn’t the only AI darling Intel missed out on. Over a decade after passing on Nvidia, Intel made another strategic miss by reportedly deciding not to buy a stake in OpenAI, which had not yet kicked off the current AI hype with the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Former Intel chief executive Bob Swan didn’t think OpenAI’s generative AI models would come to market soon enough for the investment to be worth it, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The AI startup had been interested in Intel, sources told Reuters (TRI), so it could depend less on Nvidia and build its own infrastructure.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4. As LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove “horrendous” for LLMs in the short term. “The short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They’re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it’s measurable.” However, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they’d be enjoying. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In The analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it’s competing with a lot of “big guns.” He quoted Oracle’s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a “proprietary” large language model. “So, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it’s a big raise for a private company that’s moving quickly, but they’re going to get acquired. They’re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.” For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 KeyBanc’s third-quarter 2024 survey of value-added resellers (VARs) has noted a rise in IT budget expectations. “For 2024, IT budgets saw a slight growth in expectations, but the bigger shift was in 2025, where budgets are now expected to grow by 4.4%, up from 3.2% just 90 days ago,” said KeyBanc analysts, led by Jackson Ader, in a detailed report to investors. Based on this survey, the firm gave bullish ratings to several stocks, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft’s target was increased to $505 from $490. DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum. Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria. Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA. Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins. The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities. The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: JPMorgan Chase's SWOT analysis: banking giant's stock outlook amid rate uncertainty

Time Published: 2024-10-24T13:12:39Z
Full Content:
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., the largest U.S. bank by assets, continues to demonstrate its financial strength and market leadership position as it navigates an uncertain economic environment. The banking giant has maintained its dominance across various business segments while facing challenges from interest rate fluctuations and regulatory pressures. This comprehensive analysis examines JPMorgan's recent performance, strategic initiatives, and outlook based on the latest analyst reports and company disclosures. JPMorgan Chase delivered a strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing market expectations. The earnings beat was primarily driven by robust capital markets activity, with investment banking fees surging 50% year-over-year and trading revenues increasing by 11%. This impressive showing in the bank's institutional businesses helped offset some of the pressures faced in other areas. Despite the strong quarterly results, the bank's net interest income (NII) guidance remained unchanged, which disappointed some investors who had anticipated an upward revision. JPMorgan expects NII to reach $91 billion for the full year 2024, with expenses projected at $92 billion. Looking ahead to 2025, the bank forecasts a modest decline in NII to $88 billion, reflecting a 4% year-over-year decrease. The credit quality outlook remains a key focus for investors and analysts. While the bank reported an increase in non-performing assets (NPAs) and net charge-offs (NCOs) in recent quarters, management has signaled that credit card NCOs in the second half of 2024 should be in line with first-half levels. The company expects card NCOs to be around 3.4% for 2024, with a slight increase to 3.6% projected for 2025. JPMorgan Chase continues to invest heavily in technology and innovation to maintain its competitive edge and drive future growth. The bank's annual investor day, held in May 2024, highlighted numerous growth initiatives aimed at leveraging its scale and market-leading positions across various business lines. One of the key strategic moves announced earlier in the year was the reorganization of business segments, which combined Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) with Commercial Banking (CB). This restructuring is expected to create synergies and improve operational efficiency across the institutional client base. The bank's capital return program remains robust, with a significant share buyback plan of $30 billion announced in August 2024, representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization. This demonstrates management's confidence in the company's financial strength and commitment to delivering shareholder value. While JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated resilience, it faces several challenges and risks in the current economic environment. The interest rate landscape remains uncertain, with potential rate cuts on the horizon that could pressure net interest margins. The bank's sensitivity analysis suggests that a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates could reduce NII by approximately $2.5 billion. Regulatory scrutiny continues to be a concern for large financial institutions. JPMorgan is currently evaluating litigation with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) over an inquiry into Zelle, the digital payments network. The outcome of this and other regulatory matters could impact the bank's operations and financial results. Competition in the banking sector remains fierce, with both traditional banks and fintech companies vying for market share. JPMorgan's ability to continue innovating and adapting to changing consumer preferences will be crucial for maintaining its leadership position. JPMorgan Chase's long-time Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been a key figure in the bank's success and stability. However, succession planning has become an increasingly important topic for investors. In his 2024 shareholder letter, Dimon indicated that he plans to step down within the next five years, prompting speculation about potential successors. The bank's recent executive shuffle, which saw several senior roles reassigned, has provided an opportunity for key leaders to gain experience in new areas of the business. The upcoming investor day will feature public remarks from many of these executives for the first time since the reorganization, offering insights into their integration into new roles and potential succession scenarios. JPMorgan Chase currently trades at a premium valuation compared to its peers, with a price-to-tangible book value of 2.4x versus 1.6x for other mega banks. Some analysts argue that this premium may be difficult to justify in the face of potential headwinds. The bank's net interest income, a key driver of profitability, is expected to decline in 2025 due to lower interest rates and sluggish loan growth. Additionally, the potential for flat provisions for credit costs in 2025 compared to 2024 could limit earnings growth. JPMorgan's net interest income has been a significant contributor to its recent strong performance. However, the bank faces challenges in maintaining this momentum in a potentially lower interest rate environment. With the Federal Reserve signaling possible rate cuts in the future, JPMorgan's interest income could come under pressure. The bank's own guidance suggests a $2.5 billion reduction in NII for every 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, highlighting the sensitivity of this key revenue stream to rate fluctuations. JPMorgan Chase has consistently invested heavily in technology and innovation, positioning itself as a leader in digital banking and fintech. These investments are expected to drive future growth by enhancing customer experiences, improving operational efficiency, and opening new revenue streams. The bank's scale and financial resources allow it to make significant investments in areas such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cloud computing, which could provide a competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving financial services landscape. Despite its already dominant position in many areas of banking, JPMorgan has demonstrated an ability to continue gaining market share across various business segments. The bank's strong performance in investment banking and trading, even in challenging market conditions, suggests that it can leverage its scale and relationships to outperform competitors. Additionally, the recent reorganization of business segments, combining Corporate & Investment Banking with Commercial Banking, could create new opportunities for cross-selling and market share gains among institutional clients. This analysis is based on information available up to October 24, 2024, and reflects the views and projections of various financial analysts and institutions regarding JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s stock performance and outlook.

Title: Boeing's turnaround plan is something any business can relate to: focus on the culture and the work

Good morning! Are you a fan of the "John Wick" franchise? If so, you owe a big thank you to Eva Longoria. She provided $6 million in gap financing when the first movie ran out of money and was at risk of shutting down. Our sale on a Business Insider subscription also kicks off today. Check out the details here. In today's big story, Boeing's new CEO has big plans for the company's turnaround, including executives rolling up their sleeves. What's on deck: But first, let's get this flight back on track. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Boeing's new CEO is looking to navigate a turnaround that includes rethinking the aerospace giant's culture. Boeing reported a $6.1 billion loss in the third quarter, the latest knock for a company that's faced constant setbacks this year, writes Business Insider's Pete Syme. But new CEO Kelly Ortberg has some ideas for how to fix Boeing's "festering of issues." In a memo to employees, he detailed a four-part plan for how Boeing can regain its place as an "iconic company and aerospace leader," BI's Benjamin Zhang reports. You might think a nearly $100 billion company that builds airplanes needs a specific solution. But at its core, Ortberg's plan is something any business can appreciate: focus on the culture and the work being done. For Boeing that means putting executives on factory floors with the hope it will address safety, communication, and employee trust issues, writes BI's Taylor Rains. Whether you're making sandwiches or 737s, having a front-row seat to how the work is being done often provides a better view of a company's inefficiencies than any boardroom can. Of course, Boeing's problem's are slightly more complicated than perfecting a BLT. Just a few days into 2024, a Boeing 737 Max suffered a blowout incident that tanked the company's stock and drew the attention of Congress. Since then, it has also been dealing with a costly strike and a struggling space program. Plenty of business turnarounds include talking to those in the thick of it. Starbucks' new CEO Brian Niccol, who is trying to stop the coffee chain's sales slide, is looking to baristas for help. He mentioned fixing some of the biggest problems Starbucks' "green-apron partners" have flagged to executives, like devising a better way to manage mobile orders. The effort to get direct feedback from the people doing the work is evident in Big Tech, too. The "year of efficiency" has become more of an era as tech giants like Meta and Amazon continue to flatten their organizations. Those efforts have downsides, though. Tech giants' focus on the work has meant a steady stream of layoffs as they keep removing layers. The end result could have an impact on morale. What's going on with the "whale" betting on a Trump win? Here are some theories. Someone has bet roughly $46 million on former President Donald Trump reclaiming the White House on Polymarket. Political and betting-market commentators have speculated it's either an influence campaign, a pump-and-dump scheme, or simply a bullish view on Trump's prospects next month. 2. Whether it's Trump or Harris, Steve Schwarzman isn't worried about a post-election recession. The billionaire Blackstone CEO has publicly backed the former president, but he doesn't see Vice President Kamala Harris winning as a recession risk. "The economy is pretty strong and both of the candidates keep mentioning a lot of stimulative policies," Schwarzman said. 3. Apple stock dips on reports of dimming demand for the new iPhone. Apple stock dropped as much as 3% on Wednesday after analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities said Tim Cook's company cut orders by 10 million units. Kuo also saw "no evidence" AI features were boosting demand. Meanwhile, the production of the Vision Pro is reportedly in flux. Introducing AI's power players. Now in its second year, Business Insider's 2024 AI Power list maps out who wields real power in artificial intelligence and machine learning. This year's list honors people hoping to effect change and solve problems across the industry, from Groq CEO Jonathan Ross to Google DeepMind COO Lila Ibrahim. 2. Tesla did better than expected in Q3. The electric carmaker reported earnings per share of $0.62 — a big beat over analysts expectations of $0.51. It also announced the Cybertruck turned a profit, marking a major win for Elon Musk as he enters the electric pickup market. Analysts saw the latest numbers as a clear sign that Tesla shouldn't neglect its roots. 3. A ban on celebrity jet-tracking isn't a bad idea. But Meta still has some explaining to do. This week, the company suspended Threads accounts that shared flight data of figures like Taylor Swift and Donald Trump, citing safety concerns. That seems reasonable, but it doesn't explain why Meta chose to wait until now to apply the three-year-old recommendation.

Title: My favorite head strap for Meta Quest 3 is already half price, so I think we should cancel Black Friday

If you want longer Batman Arkham Shadow sessions on Quest 3, you need to know about this head strap deal. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta Quest accessory discounts have been a staple of Black Friday since I started covering gaming hardware deals. Sure, throughout the year and during Prime Day you'll often see some sporadic price cuts, but November is when we see head straps, charging stands, and everything else get the biggest price cuts. The holiday sales have seemingly come early this year though, and the deal I was really hoping to see has already arrived. KIWI Design's Comfort Head Strap for Quest 3 (and now Quest 3S) not only makes Meta's flagship headset so much comfier, but it also has an added battery pack attached that extends your playtime. It's 50% off at Amazon right now, bringing its price down to just $29.99 from its usual $59.99. This is easily my favorite Meta Quest head strap because the level of comfort it gives you during longer gaming sessions is unmatched. It would seem to me that the best Meta Quest accessories are getting competitive at the moment, probably because their various manufacturers know that there's more interest in jazzing up headsets than ever, thanks to the arrival of the Meta Quest 3S. So here we are, a month away from proper Black Friday Meta Quest deals, and we already have a half-off discount on one of the best accessories there is. KIWI Design comfort battery head strap for Quest 3 / Quest 3S | $59.99 $29.99 at AmazonSave $29 - KIWI's head strap can often be found discounted, but almost never below $40. All you need to do to get this 50% saving is check the box on the retail page that says "Apply 50% Coupon". Buy it if: ✅ You want more comfort in your VR gaming sessions✅ You want longer battery life✅ The headset weight annoys you Don't buy it if: ❌ You use the Quest 3 for fitness activities Price check: Newegg: $39.99 UK: £39.99 £29.99 at Amazon This is the head strap I use on my own Meta Quest 3, which I don't think is an uncomfortable headset out of the box. After feeling the plush, leather-covered cushioning Kiwi Design has used here though, I'm not sure I'd ever want to go back to the stock head strap. The halo around the back of your noggin really makes it feel supported and helps to take the weight of the headset off your forehead. Annoyingly, the top band will still make a mess of your hair-do, but that's a small price to pay. Not only that, but the added battery life really is a game-changer. I've found that Kiwi's head strap lets me play games like Pistol Whip, Power Wash Sim VR, or Asgard's Wrath 2, for far longer, and the handy LED indicator on it shows you how much life is left before needing to recharge. If you've just started playing the new Batman Arkham Shadow game, this type of accessory will let you role-play as Gotham's caped crusader for longer. That said, my only real caveat to recommending this is that it doesn't feel quite as secure on your head because of the premium leatherette materials used. If you tend to use the best VR headsets for fitness apps, or games that require a lot of vigorous head tilting and erratic movements, you might not want to go for this slightly bulkier strap. Besides that, there are very few reasons against buying Kiwi's headband, especially under $30. You should also check out Black Friday VR headset deals, Black Friday gaming chair deals, and Black Friday gaming PC deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Ever since playing Journey at the age of 15, I’ve been desperate to cover video games for a living. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship over at Expert Reviews. Besides that, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel and Podcast for the last 7 years. It’s been a long road, but all that experience somehow landed me a dream job covering gaming hardware. I’m a self-confessing PlayStation fanboy, but my experience covering the larger business and developer side of the whole industry has given me a strong knowledge of all platforms. When I’m not testing out every peripheral I can get my hands on, I’m probably either playing tennis or dissecting game design for an upcoming video essay. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote I almost fell for this fake PSVR 2 deal this Prime Day, don't make my mistake This is probably your last chance to get the 128GB Quest 3, but it's not the only VR headset discount I'd recommend right now On its 20th anniversary, GTA San Andreas veteran shares the open-world was originally split into three maps: "Memory was very tight on the PS2" GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: Amazon exec says 9 out of 10 workers are happy with the company’s RTO mandate—but research suggests many of them will up and leave

Amazon isn’t only putting its foot down and reaffirming its commitment to returning to working in an office five days a week from January 2025—one of the company’s top execs is even claiming that employees are rejoicing at the mandate. Matt Garman, the CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, insisted that “nine out of 10” workers he had spoken to are looking forward to the new policy being enforced. And if they’re not? “That’s okay, there are other companies around,” the head of the tech giant’s cloud computing business said in an internal call that’s been reviewed by Reuters. Research suggests that many employees may do exactly that. Garman may be in for a shock: Despite his assessment that most workers are raring to return to their desks, reams of research suggest that many will be disgruntled and take up his offer to quit. Already, 67% of U.S. employers have lost talent to competitors offering remote or hybrid work options in the past six months, according to a new report from Remote. Globally, over 73% of employers across 10 countries, including the U.K., Germany and Japan, have faced a similar dilemma after calling time on remote work. After all, they’re competing with the 70% of firms that have said they’re embracing—and even broadening—their remote policies. The same percentage of businesses have said that they’ve accepted hybrid working as the new norm. You can already see this in action at Amazon: A handful of employees anonymously told Fortune that they had already contacted recruiters and interviewed for more flexible jobs just 48 hours after the tech giant announced it’s toughened stance on working from home. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” an exasperated working mom complained. “I’ve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.” She’s not alone: The anonymous job review site Blind polled 2,585 verified Amazon professionals one day after its CEO Andy Jassy sent out the RTO memo and 73% admitted they are considering quitting in response. Over a third said that they knew someone at the company who had already handed in their resignation because of the announcement. Amazon declined to comment on how it’s readying itself for a potential exodus of staff—or whether that’s what the $1.94 trillion tech giant secrently really wants. While Jassy positioned Amazon’s changes—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better, more collaborative way to work, some employees are adamant that it’s a thinly veiled headcount reduction. After all, research recently found that a quarter of C-suite executives secretly hoped for some voluntary turnover among workers after implementing an RTO policy. “It’s a rob Peter to pay Paul situation of short-term gains from voluntary layoffs in exchange for losing top talent and reducing productivity for years to come,” a Gen X program manager told Fortune. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Roku Stock's Recent 50% Rally To Continue?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/24/roku-stocks-recent-50-rally-to-continue/

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Charlie Collier, Chelsea Peretti and Amy Poehler seen at Los ... [+] Angeles Friends and Family Screening of Roku's "First Time Female Director" at Vidiots Foundation - Eagle Theatre on March 18, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Eric Charbonneau/Getty Images for Roku) Roku has fared well over the last few months, rising by about 50% since early August. This compares with streaming titan Netflix, which has seen its stock rise close to 29% over the same period. Now Roku is poised to report its Q3 2024 results later this month and we do expect things to get a bit better for the company. We expect revenue to come in at about $1.03 billion for the quarter, up about 13% compared to last year, while net losses are expected to narrow to about $0.30 per share beating estimates. See our analysis of Roku Earnings Preview for some of the trends that are likely to drive Roku’s results for the third quarter. Roku’s operational and financial performance has been improving. Over Q2, Roku’s revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $968 million while operating losses were reduced to $71 million. Key metrics such as streaming hours (up 20%) and total platform accounts (up 14%) also strengthened, while device sales jumped 39%, helping to increase Roku’s installed base. The Roku Channel, the company’s proprietary streaming offering, has also gained in terms of engagement, with streaming hours up nearly 75% year-over-year with the offering emerging as one of the most popular free, ad-supported streaming offerings in the U.S. This is expected to drive higher-margin advertising revenue in the long run. That said, Roku’s per-user revenue growth for its platform business has been easing due to increased sales from international markets. Heightened competition in the advertising markets could also be hurting the company. ARPU stood at $40.68 for the last quarter, roughly flat compared to last year. We will be closely tracking Roku’s cost management and cash flows for the quarter, following the company’s strong recent progress. In Q2 the company saw total operating expenses fall by 2% year-over-year, driven by workforce and office space reductions in 2023. Free cash flow stood at $318 million for Q2, up from negative levels in the year-ago quarter. See a scenario on how Roku stock can hit $200 The decrease in ROKU stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, and 125% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could ROKU face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? Roku stock trades at just a little over 2.5x estimated 2024 revenue, which is well below the double-digit multiples the stock traded at in 2021. That said, Roku faces challenges, too. Roku’s streaming service distribution business, which facilitates the subscription process for streaming services and earns commissions for the same, is seeing some headwinds as more streaming services, including Netflix, focus on selling more affordable, ad-supported plans as customers look for better value in a mixed economic environment. Moreover, Roku has to increasingly compete for advertising-related revenue with big technology players including Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet in the video market. We value Roku stock at about $67, which 13% below the current market price. We will be revisiting our price estimate for the stock post Q3 earnings. See our analysis on Roku Valuation: Expensive or Cheap for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for the stock.

Title: Europe’s Electric Vehicle Woes Are a Lesson for EVs Everywhere

Electric cars got top billing at this year’s Paris Auto Show. At the world’s largest such showcase, a central exhibition hall featured an “electric factory” display designed, in the colors of the French flag, to mimic the spine-like assembly lines that churn out electric cars and internal combustion engines. Along the exteriors of those lines were a series of questions answered inside them, where clumps of teens on school trips and car enthusiasts stood by ready to hear the answers: Are electric vehicles produced in France? What new professions are created by electric vehicle production? Just outside the exhibition grounds, autoworkers who spend their days in real-world auto factories had a question of their own: Why are so many of them losing their jobs? A few hundred trade unionists from France, Italy, the United States, and elsewhere gathered in the rain to rail against Stellantis chief Carlos Tavares, the embattled CEO whose global auto group is fending off accusations of mismanagement from workers and investors alike. Late last month, Stellantis issued a profit warning amid lower than expected sales “across most regions.” The company has temporarily suspended production of its fully electric Fiat 500e, citing low sales as it temporarily lays off workers in Italy; Stellantis plans to start producing a hybrid version of the car in 2025 or 2026. Similarly, in the United States, the company has blamed “market conditions” to backtrack on a pledge—enshrined in its contract with the UAW—to reopen and expand an idled plant in Belvidere, Illinois, to include a $3.2 billion battery plant. Stellantis recently announced too that it will expand production of its bestselling, gas-powered Dodge RAM pickups in Mexico. Starting on October 12, it began laying off approximately 1,100 workers from its Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan after ending production of the RAM 1500 Classic pickup there. On October 18, Stellantis workers in Italy carried out a 24-hour nationwide strike, culminating in a rally that brought an estimated 20,000 people out to Rome’s Piazza del Popolo. UAW members recently authorized their own strike against Stellantis, and are in tense negotiations with the company over unrealized investment commitments. The company has filed nine federal lawsuits against the UAW and two dozen locals disputing the union’s contract-violation claims and right to strike over them, arguing the pledge was always “contingent upon plant performance, changes in market conditions and consumer demand.” Amid all this, Tavares has tried to paint himself as a stalwart defender of electrification, ready to weather the winds of change even if that proves difficult in the near term. Speaking to the Financial Times at the Paris Auto Show, he warned that slowing the transition to electric vehicles would be “a big trap” and blamed governments for failing to provide adequate incentives to make the switch. Unions on either side of the Atlantic, however, argue that they’re paying the price for Stellantis’s longtime, short-term focus on maximizing profits and executive pay. “Stellantis has underinvested in this,” i.e., the electric transition, says Maurizio Oreggia, international coordinator for the Italian metalworkers’ union FIOM. He agrees that the Italian government and European Union aren’t doing enough to offer public support for electrification, bolstering which is among FIOM’s top demands. But he also sees Stellantis’s own choices as a key reason why the automaker is falling behind. “This transition is necessary given climate change, if you look at the situation of the planet. But we’ve known we have to do this for many years,” he adds. Instead of reinvesting profits into research and development, improving working conditions, or electrification, “they have distributed profits to shareholders, never to the workers.” Earlier this month, Stellantis announced that it had bought $1.1 billion worth of stock back from shareholders since August. Tavares received a 56 percent pay bump last year. Defending his lavish compensation package in April, Tavares said it was simply part of the contract between himself and the company, “just as there are contracts for soccer players and for Formula 1 drivers.” The situation facing autoworkers is especially acute in Italy, where anger at Stellantis is pitched. Stellantis was created in 2021 through the merger of the French auto group Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler Automotives. Fiat has long been Italy’s only mass-market automaker, responsible for the bulk of the roughly 1.5 million cars made there as recently as the early 2000s. This year, Italy is expected to produce fewer than 500,000 cars, half as many as it made in 2018 and 250,000 fewer than it made last year. That decline has been especially hard-felt in the northern city of Turin—the longtime home of “Mamma Fiat”—which has seen four car plants close since 1982. “The trend is downward in all European countries, but in Italy it’s been particularly strong. Various governments never allowed a foreign player to enter the Italian domestic market for car production,” says economist Simone Gasperin. In addition to heavily subsidizing auto plant construction, Italy historically used state-owned enterprises to support its car industry. That included efforts to build out the country’s highway system and offer cheaper gasoline prices via Eni. Through Alfa Romeo, Gasperine explains that the Italian government “was able to inject a dose of competition, which made Fiat more sensitive to things like investing to remain competitive. It was a way to reduce their monopolistic power.” Fiat acquired Alfa Romeo in 1986 amid a wave of privatizations. Since then, successive governments have generally relied on consumer-side subsidies to bolster the auto sector. And whereas the Inflation Reduction Act’s consumer-side E.V. incentives require that cars and their components be made in the U.S. or its trade partners in order to qualify, EU law generally prohibits these kinds of domestic content requirements. Even the comparatively generous state support for automakers to go electric in the United States can’t make up for their decades spent doubling down on internal combustion engines. Companies have reliably resisted regulatory efforts—like more stringent fuel efficiency standards—that might have spurred innovation. “Stellantis was one of the slowest, if not the slowest, to begin their transition to the next generation of vehicles,” says UAW Region 4 Director Brandon Campbell, who joined the demonstration in Paris and the strike rally in Rome; he first came to the union when he started working at the Belvidere plant in 1994. “They’re paying the price for that, but that is driven by their poor management and their poor decisions.” (For the sake of disclosure, my partner works for the UAW.) The EU has moved to end the sale of internal combustion engine–powered vehicles by 2035, a decision now facing fierce pushback from powerful parties within the bloc. While such a policy certainly spurs demand for E.V.s, it’s not at all clear that European companies will be making them. “Europe has already a much more developed E.V. market than the U.S. but is not prepared to produce most of the E.V.s that will be sold here,” Gasperin tells me. As Chinese companies roll out affordable E.V.s at home and abroad, Stellantis and other European automakers have felt pressured to lower prices in order to compete with foreign companies and convince consumers to buy the still relatively limited range of electric models they’re producing. Larger and more expensive cars make for bigger margins, though. In the U.S., where there’s no looming phaseout deadline for gas-powered cars, automakers including Stellantis have seemed content to double down on mostly gas-powered bestsellers like the RAM and Ford F-Series—however limited the demand for those hulking, pricey trucks and SUVs might be elsewhere. “Manufacturers’ only strategy is to preserve their margins,” Sophie Binet, secretary-general of France’s powerful General Confederation of Labour, or CGT, told those gathered outside the Paris Auto Show last week. “Given our salaries, no worker can afford a car that costs 40, 50, 60, or 100,000 euros.” As the factories making those cars close and companies move production abroad, she quipped that “the CGT project is simple: a small economical electric vehicle entirely manufactured in France, which could be sold for around 15,000 euros.” Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Sorry! Your browser is not supported. To view this site you can download a newer version of Internet Explorer. Share this The 90-tonne Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) machine has been custom-designed and built for Rocket Lab and is expected to save around 150,000 manufacturing hours in the Neutron rocket’s production process. Long Beach, California. August 8, 2024. – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has begun installation of the largest automated fiber placement (AFP) machine of its kind into the Company’s Neutron rocket production line in Middle River, MD. The AFP machine will enable Rocket Lab to automate production of the largest carbon composite rocket structures in history. The custom-built 99 ton (90 tonne), 39 ft tall (12-meter) robotic machine, American-made by Electroimpact in Washington, has just completed final acceptance testing with the manufacturer and installation has begun at Rocket Lab’s Space Structures Complex in Middle River, Maryland. The new machine will automate the production of all large composite structures of the Neutron launch vehicle including the panels that make up the 91 ft (28 meter) length interstage and fairing, 22.9 ft (7 meter) diameter first stage, and the 16.4 ft (5 meter) diameter second stage tank. The autonomous machine can move up to 98 ft (30 meters) in length and lay down continuous carbon fiber composite at a rate of 328 ft (100 meters) per minute. The AFP machine also has a fully automated real-time inspection system that hunts for miniscule defects throughout the laminated carbon composite and alerts the machine operator of any issues before the machine begins laying down the next layer, providing additional assurance that these critical structures of the launch vehicle meet Rocket Lab’s high-quality standards required for reusable Neutron launches. As Neutron’s carbon composite structures move into full-scale production, this autonomous machine is expected to introduce significant time-savings of 150,000+ manufacturing hours into the production process. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “As we build the world’s largest carbon composite rocket, it makes sense that we require a world-first carbon composite fiber placement machine. We’re combining our proprietary flight-proven carbon composite technology, additive manufacturing, and autonomous robotics to design and build large-scale aerospace components at a pace that will support not only Neutron’s launch cadence, but support Electron and carbon composites structures for our spacecraft customers too. We worked closely with our excellent partners at Electroimpact to create this robot and we’re thrilled with the results. It’s an innovative machine producing a next-generation rocket from one of the birthplaces of the aerospace industry in Baltimore, and we can’t wait to see its first carbon composite printed panels come off the production line soon.” The AFP machine will also be leveraged to print smaller carbon composite Neutron structures, first stages of Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle, and other flight-proven carbon composite structures for space including spacecraft structural panels and assemblies, solar panel substrates, carbon composite tanks and primary structures, and custom projects for the aerospace industry. ENDS About Neutron Neutron is the new medium-lift reusable launch vehicle by Rocket Lab. Capable of carrying up to 13,000 kg to low Earth orbit, Neutron is designed to deliver constellations of satellites to space at once, important national security missions, and human exploration beyond Earth’s orbit. Neutron will be the world’s first medium-lift carbon composite rocket, building off of Rocket Lab’s proprietary and flight-proven techniques utilized across 50+ launches of its Electron carbon composite small orbital launch vehicle. Powering Neutron is Rocket Lab’s new 3D printed reusable rocket engine Archimedes, an oxygen-rich staged combustion engine using liquid oxygen and methane propellants that is designed for rapid reusability, deep throttle ability for multiple engine burns in space, and for propulsive landings when returning to the launch site. Neutron will launch and land at its own dedicated launch and test range within Rocket Lab Launch Complex 3 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island, Virginia, starting in 2025.

Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV), a leading healthcare company offering a range of insurance and healthcare services, has recently faced challenges in its Medicaid business while maintaining growth potential in other segments. This comprehensive analysis examines the company's current position, recent financial performance, and future prospects in light of industry trends and competitive pressures. Elevance Health operates through various segments, including Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other segments. The company has recently expanded its footprint through strategic acquisitions, including Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy, and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Specialty Pharmacy. These acquisitions have bolstered Elevance Health's position in the specialty pharmacy sector, a move that analysts view as potentially driving future growth. Elevance Health's recent financial performance has been marked by challenges, particularly in its Medicaid business. The company has lowered its earnings per share (EPS) guidance for 2024 and now expects mid-single-digit EPS growth in 2025, a significant decrease from its previous long-term growth target of over 12%. This adjustment has led to a decline in the company's share price and prompted analysts to revise their projections. Despite these challenges, some analysts maintain a positive outlook on Elevance Health's long-term prospects. The company's core commercial business remains strong, and there is potential for expansion in this segment. Additionally, Elevance Health's Carelon division is seen as having robust growth potential, which could help offset some of the pressures in other areas of the business. The primary source of Elevance Health's recent challenges lies in its Medicaid business. The company has experienced increased utilization in outpatient services, particularly in radiology and medical equipment. This trend, coupled with a timing mismatch between rates and acuity, has put pressure on Medicaid margins. Analysts expect these Medicaid-related headwinds to be temporary, with some projecting that margins will normalize by 2027. However, the near-term impact on earnings is significant, with new EPS guidance for 2024 set at $33, down by $4.20 from previous estimates. Elevance Health's management has indicated that they do not anticipate an acceleration of current Medicaid cost trends but expect them to sustain. The company's ability to manage these challenges and secure appropriate rate adjustments will be crucial for its performance in the coming years. While Medicaid has been a source of concern, Elevance Health's Medicare and commercial businesses have shown more stability. Medicare trends are reported to be in line with expectations, although there are some concerns about potential margin pressure in 2025 due to richer flex card benefits and the impact of the two-midnight rule on inpatient costs. The commercial business has demonstrated consistent trends with previous quarters, providing a steady foundation for the company. However, analysts note potential risks, including commercial risk spread compression and shifts in commercial risk from Administrative Services Only (ASO) arrangements. Elevance Health's Carelon division represents a significant opportunity for growth. The company is expected to drive upside through specialty sales in Blues networks, leveraging its recent acquisitions in the specialty pharmacy sector. Analysts view this expansion positively, seeing it as a key driver of future earnings growth and a potential offset to challenges in other segments. The managed care industry is facing several challenges and changes that impact Elevance Health and its competitors. Recent analysis of Medicare Advantage plans for 2025 indicates broad-based benefit cuts across the industry, which could affect customer satisfaction and retention. Elevance Health has made relatively modest cuts to its health plan benefits for 2025 compared to its peers, potentially positioning it favorably in terms of customer attraction and retention. However, elevated concerns about Stars ratings pose risks to companies' reputations and could potentially affect enrollment numbers. Additionally, the industry faces scrutiny, with a potential House investigation into PBM industry concentration adding regulatory uncertainty. Elevance Health's Medicaid business is currently facing significant headwinds due to increased utilization in outpatient services and a mismatch between rates and acuity. These challenges have already led to a reduction in EPS guidance for 2024 and lower growth expectations for 2025. If these issues persist longer than anticipated or if the company is unable to secure appropriate rate adjustments, it could result in prolonged margin pressure in the Medicaid segment. The company's profitability could be further impacted if state budgets tighten, leading to more aggressive rate negotiations or benefit reductions. Additionally, if the normalization of Medicaid margins takes longer than the projected timeline of 2027, it could lead to a sustained period of underperformance in this segment, potentially dragging down overall company profitability. While Elevance Health's Medicare business has been relatively stable, there are emerging risks that could impact its performance. One significant concern is the potential for margin pressure in 2025 due to richer flex card benefits. If competitors offer more attractive benefits, Elevance Health may need to follow suit to maintain market share, which could erode profitability. Another risk factor is the impact of the two-midnight rule on inpatient costs. If these costs continue to rise without corresponding reimbursement increases, it could squeeze Medicare margins. Additionally, there are concerns about potential adverse selection due to deep benefit cuts by competitors. If Elevance Health maintains more generous benefits while others cut back, it may attract higher-risk beneficiaries, potentially leading to increased medical costs and lower profitability in the Medicare segment. Elevance Health's diversified business model, encompassing commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, and specialty services, provides the company with multiple avenues for growth and recovery. While the Medicaid segment is currently facing challenges, the company's strong core commercial business and stable Medicare operations offer a solid foundation for overall performance. The Carelon division, in particular, represents a significant growth opportunity. With recent acquisitions in the specialty pharmacy sector, Elevance Health is well-positioned to expand its presence in this high-growth area. The potential for increased specialty sales through Blues networks could drive substantial revenue growth, helping to offset temporary setbacks in other segments. Furthermore, the company's diversification allows it to balance risks across different market segments. As Medicaid challenges are addressed and margins potentially normalize by 2027, growth in other areas of the business could help Elevance Health return to its long-term growth trajectory. Elevance Health's recent acquisitions of Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy, and Kroger Specialty Pharmacy have significantly bolstered its position in the specialty pharmacy sector. This strategic expansion presents several growth opportunities for the company. Firstly, the specialty pharmacy market is experiencing rapid growth due to the increasing prevalence of chronic and complex diseases requiring specialized medications. By strengthening its presence in this sector, Elevance Health can tap into this growing market, potentially driving significant revenue increases. Secondly, the integration of these specialty pharmacies with Elevance Health's existing health plans and provider networks could create synergies that improve patient care and reduce overall healthcare costs. This integrated approach could make Elevance Health more attractive to both individual consumers and employer groups seeking comprehensive healthcare solutions. Lastly, the expansion into specialty pharmacy aligns well with the company's Carelon division, which is already seen as a strong growth driver. The combination of Carelon's existing capabilities with the newly acquired specialty pharmacy assets could create a powerful platform for innovation in medication management and care coordination, potentially setting Elevance Health apart from its competitors in the managed care industry.

Title: Ford's SWOT analysis: stock outlook amid EV transition and cost challenges
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/fords-swot-analysis-stock-outlook-amid-ev-transition-and-cost-challenges-93CH-3679340

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), a global leader in the automotive industry, is navigating a complex landscape of challenges and opportunities as it transitions towards electric vehicles (EVs) and digital services. This comprehensive analysis examines Ford's current position, future prospects, and the factors influencing its stock performance. Ford, trading under the ticker NYSE:F, has a long-standing presence in the global automotive market. The company manufactures and distributes vehicles across six continents, with a product lineup that includes cars, trucks, and utility vehicles under the Ford and Lincoln brands. In recent years, Ford has been intensifying its focus on electric vehicles and connected services, aiming to position itself as a leader in the evolving automotive industry. Ford's financial performance has been a mixed bag in recent quarters. The company's second-quarter earnings for 2024 fell short of elevated expectations, disappointing some stakeholders. Despite this setback, Ford maintained its guidance for the fiscal year 2024, projecting adjusted EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) in the range of $10 to $12 billion. Analysts are divided on Ford's near-term prospects. Some believe the company may reach the upper end of its guidance range, citing potential strengths in the Pro segment, cost improvements, and reduced losses from the Model e division. Others express concern about the impact of price normalization and the possibility of a slowdown in the latter half of 2024. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to grow from $2.01 in FY23 to $2.20 in FY25, indicating a positive trajectory despite near-term challenges. Ford's electric vehicle strategy is a critical component of its future growth plans. The company is committed to expanding its EV lineup, leveraging iconic nameplates and its strong position in commercial vehicles. The introduction of Gen-2 EV platforms is anticipated to be a potential game-changer, with analysts suggesting it could transition Ford's EV segment from losses to profits. However, the EV transition is not without challenges. Recent data shows that Ford's EV sales have not demonstrated significant quarter-over-quarter growth, raising questions about the pace of adoption and market demand. The company's "Skunkworks" platform is seen as potentially transformative, but it remains a "show-me story," indicating that its success is yet to be proven. Cost management has been a persistent challenge for Ford. Warranty costs, in particular, have been a significant drag on profitability, highlighting ongoing quality issues that need to be addressed. The company has acknowledged these challenges and is reportedly undergoing a cultural change to improve cost control and operational efficiency. Ford's restructuring efforts, especially in overseas markets, have shown positive results. However, cost structures in the United States remain high, presenting an ongoing area for improvement. Ford faces intense competition in the automotive industry, particularly as the sector shifts towards electrification and digital services. The company's Pro segment, which focuses on commercial vehicles, has shown strength and is expected to benefit from software and service offerings. This segment could be a key differentiator for Ford in the competitive landscape. Investor sentiment has shown a preference for General Motors (NYSE:GM) over Ford, primarily due to differences in capital return profiles. This preference underscores the importance of Ford's efforts to improve its financial performance and shareholder returns. Looking ahead, Ford's future prospects are tied to several key factors. The company's ability to successfully transition to electric vehicles while maintaining profitability in its traditional segments will be crucial. The growing focus on software and services, particularly in connected vehicles, presents an opportunity for Ford to tap into new revenue streams and potentially improve margins. The company's electrification strategy, which leverages iconic nameplates and its strong position in commercial vehicles, could provide a competitive advantage. However, execution risks remain, and the success of Ford's low-cost EV platform will be closely watched by investors and industry observers. Warranty costs have been a significant concern for Ford, negatively impacting its profitability. These costs not only affect the company's bottom line directly but also raise questions about product quality and reliability. If Ford fails to address these issues effectively, it could lead to continued financial strain and potentially damage the brand's reputation. Improving quality control and reducing warranty-related expenses will be crucial for enhancing profitability and maintaining customer trust. Ford's transition to electric vehicles comes with substantial risks. The company is investing heavily in EV technology and production, but market adoption rates remain uncertain. If EV sales growth fails to meet expectations, Ford could face overcapacity issues and lower returns on its investments. Additionally, the competitive landscape in the EV market is intensifying, with both traditional automakers and new entrants vying for market share. Ford must navigate these challenges while also managing the decline of its traditional internal combustion engine business, which still accounts for a significant portion of its revenues and profits. Ford's increasing focus on software and services, particularly in connected vehicles, presents a significant opportunity to boost margins. These digital offerings typically have higher profit margins compared to traditional vehicle sales. By developing a robust ecosystem of software and services, Ford could create new revenue streams that are less cyclical than vehicle sales. This shift could also enhance customer loyalty and provide valuable data insights, allowing Ford to improve its products and services continually. If executed successfully, this strategy could transform Ford's business model and financial profile, potentially leading to higher valuation multiples similar to those seen in tech companies. Ford's Gen-2 EV platform has the potential to significantly improve the company's market position in the electric vehicle segment. This new platform is expected to be more cost-effective and efficient, potentially allowing Ford to offer competitive EVs at lower price points. If successful, it could help Ford capture a larger share of the growing EV market and improve profitability in this segment. The Gen-2 platform could also enable Ford to expand its EV lineup more rapidly, covering a broader range of vehicle types and price points. This flexibility could be crucial in adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory requirements, positioning Ford as a strong competitor in the evolving automotive landscape. Strengths: Weaknesses: Opportunities: Threats: This analysis is based on information available up to October 24, 2024, and reflects the complex dynamics shaping Ford's future in a rapidly evolving automotive industry.

Title: DoubleVerify's SWOT analysis: digital ad verification stock faces headwinds

DoubleVerify Holdings , Inc. (NYSE:DV), a leading provider of digital media measurement and analytics software, has been navigating a challenging landscape in recent months. The company, which aims to ensure ad viewability and effectiveness across digital platforms, has seen its stock price decline significantly year-to-date, prompting a closer examination of its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the evolving digital advertising ecosystem. DoubleVerify operates in the digital media space, offering software solutions for online media verification and optimization. The company's core value proposition revolves around providing brand safety, ad fraud protection, and viewability measurement for digital advertisers. In an increasingly complex digital advertising landscape, DoubleVerify's services have become critical for many large advertisers seeking to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of their online campaigns. The company operates in what some analysts describe as a duopoly within the ad verification sector, competing primarily with Integral Ad Science (IAS). This market structure has allowed DoubleVerify to maintain strong margins and a defensible business model. However, the recent exit of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) from the ads business with the closure of its Moat and Grapeshot offerings has created both opportunities and challenges for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent financial performance has been mixed, reflecting both the company's strong market position and the challenges it faces. In its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $156 million, representing a 17% year-over-year increase and slightly exceeding consensus estimates. The company's EBITDA for the quarter was $46.8 million, with a margin of 30%, surpassing the high end of its guidance. However, DoubleVerify has faced headwinds that have impacted its near-term outlook. The company recently reduced its full-year revenue guidance by $27 million, citing issues with some of its largest advertisers. This adjustment has raised concerns among investors and analysts about the company's growth trajectory and customer concentration risks. Looking ahead, DoubleVerify expects growth of approximately 15% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024. While this represents a deceleration from previous growth rates, the company and some analysts anticipate a potential re-acceleration in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025. DoubleVerify's growth strategy is heavily focused on capitalizing on opportunities in social media and Connected TV (CTV) advertising. The company has seen strong growth in social measurement revenue, which increased by 44% year-over-year in the most recent quarter, driven by short-form video platforms. Additionally, video impressions now account for over 50% of measured impressions, with CTV impressions growing by 55% year-over-year. However, the company faces challenges in fully capitalizing on these opportunities. The anticipated growth from social media and CTV platforms has been progressing slower than initially expected, creating some near-term headwinds for revenue growth. Additionally, DoubleVerify's limited pre-bid solutions for social media advertising have created challenges as advertisers shift more spending to these platforms. Another significant challenge for DoubleVerify is its high customer concentration. The company's recent guidance reduction was primarily attributed to issues with a small number of its top 100 customers. This concentration highlights the potential volatility in DoubleVerify's revenue if key customers reduce spending or switch to competitors. Despite these challenges, DoubleVerify is pursuing several strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth. One of the most significant is its partnership with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). This collaboration represents a substantial opportunity, with over 40 advertisers currently testing DoubleVerify's solutions on Meta's platforms. Analysts estimate that this partnership could potentially generate over $90 million in revenue for DoubleVerify over time. The company is also focusing on expanding its presence in retail media networks, which have been a core driver of supply-side revenue growth. As major retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:NYSE:WMT) continue to build out their advertising platforms, DoubleVerify is well-positioned to provide verification and measurement services for these growing ecosystems. DoubleVerify's recent guidance reduction, primarily due to issues with a small number of large customers, highlights the risks associated with its high customer concentration. This dependence on a relatively small group of advertisers for a significant portion of revenue creates vulnerability to spending fluctuations or potential customer losses. If these issues persist or expand to other key accounts, it could lead to further revenue volatility and potentially impact the company's long-term growth trajectory. The slower-than-anticipated ramp-up in social media and CTV advertising presents a significant challenge for DoubleVerify. These areas were expected to be major growth drivers, and the company's limited pre-bid solutions for social platforms have created headwinds as advertisers shift more spending to these channels. If DoubleVerify cannot accelerate its product development and market penetration in these crucial segments, it may struggle to achieve the growth rates necessary to justify its valuation and meet investor expectations. The partnership with Meta Platforms represents a substantial growth opportunity for DoubleVerify. With over 40 advertisers already testing the company's solutions on Meta's platforms and potential revenue estimates exceeding $90 million over time, this collaboration could be a game-changer. Success in this partnership could not only drive significant revenue growth but also enhance DoubleVerify's market position and attract new customers seeking comprehensive verification across major digital platforms. Despite recent challenges, DoubleVerify's long-term growth prospects remain strong. The company operates in a duopoly within the ad verification sector, maintains high margins, and has multiple growth levers. The recent stock price decline has brought valuations to more attractive levels, with the company trading at lower multiples compared to historical averages. If DoubleVerify can successfully navigate near-term headwinds and capitalize on opportunities in social, CTV, and retail media, the current valuation could represent an attractive entry point for long-term investors.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to dominate the e-commerce and cloud computing landscapes, but the tech giant faces mounting challenges as it seeks to maintain its robust growth trajectory. Recent analyst reports paint a picture of a company leveraging its strengths in retail and cloud services while grappling with intensifying competition and regulatory scrutiny. Amazon's core retail business has demonstrated resilience in the face of economic headwinds. The company's U.S. sales of apparel and footwear exceeded $68 billion in 2023, capturing a 13.2% share of all apparel sold in the U.S. and a 41.4% share of all apparel sold online. Analysts project continued growth in Amazon's softlines business, with expectations of a 12.6% increase to approximately $77 billion in 2024. However, there are signs of a slowdown in the company's retail momentum. The recent Prime Day event saw a deceleration in growth, with Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) growing by only 5% compared to the previous year's 25% growth. Additionally, Amazon's Total Addressable Market (TAM) growth share slowed to 16% in Q2 of 2024, indicating a normalization after the rapid acceleration experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing division, has shown signs of renewed vigor. Revenue growth for AWS has seen an uptick from 12% in Q2 2023 to 19% in Q2 2024. This acceleration is attributed to reduced optimization headwinds and increased demand for generative AI services. Analysts believe the future growth of AWS hinges on the trajectory of generative AI demand, particularly compute usage for training and inference, as well as adoption of Amazon's own AI products. While there is optimism about AWS's growth potential due to AI, the return on invested capital (ROIC) for generative AI at scale remains unproven, leading some analysts to project conservative high-teens percentage growth for AWS over the next few quarters. Amazon's advertising business has emerged as a significant profit driver, with the potential to reshape the company's financial profile. The introduction of ads on Prime Video, along with an ad-free tier option, is expected to contribute approximately $1.95 billion in incremental advertising revenue in 2024, growing to over $10 billion by 2028. The company's vertically integrated full-stack advertising platform is considered capable of delivering a range of advertising solutions from upper to lower funnel. Amazon's Prime membership provides valuable data and attribution capabilities, potentially unmatched by competitors. Some analysts believe the consensus may be underestimating Amazon's potential to gain market share in advertising, which could lead to more leverage in its e-commerce cost structure. Amazon continues to invest in long-term growth initiatives that could reshape its business model. Project Kuiper, the company's satellite internet service provider business, is expected to begin launching satellites by late 2024 with a significant portion in orbit by July 2026 and the full constellation by July 2029. While the estimated $10 billion investment in Project Kuiper is substantial, analysts consider it reasonable over a 3-4 year period given Amazon's robust operating income. Another area of focus is the company's investment in electric and autonomous vehicles. Amazon could potentially save approximately $20 billion annually by deploying autonomous electric vehicles for middle-mile transport and replacing internal combustion engine delivery vans with electric Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) vans. Electric vehicles can reduce per-mile energy costs by nearly 50%, and autonomous technology could lower driver-related costs, which represent over 40% of the cost per mile in middle-mile delivery. Despite its dominant position, Amazon faces increasing competition from both traditional retailers and new entrants. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) continues to gain market share in the retail space, while companies like Temu and Shein are emerging as formidable competitors in the e-commerce sector. The potential closure of the de minimis loophole could negatively impact Temu's unit economics, which are already unsustainable with losses of $35-40 per order. While this could benefit Amazon in the short term, it also highlights the volatile nature of the competitive landscape. Regulatory scrutiny remains a concern for Amazon, particularly regarding antitrust issues. The company's vast reach across multiple industries and its market power in e-commerce and cloud computing have drawn the attention of regulators in various jurisdictions. This ongoing scrutiny could potentially impact Amazon's ability to pursue certain strategic initiatives or acquisitions in the future. Amazon's retail business, while dominant, operates on relatively thin margins. The emergence of aggressive competitors like Temu and Shein, along with the continued strength of traditional retailers like Walmart, could put pressure on these margins. These competitors may force Amazon to engage in price wars or increase spending on marketing and customer acquisition, potentially eroding profitability. Moreover, as the e-commerce market matures, the cost of customer acquisition and retention may rise. Amazon may need to invest more heavily in its Prime program and other loyalty initiatives to maintain its market share, which could further impact margins. The company's ongoing investments in fulfillment and logistics, while necessary for long-term competitiveness, also represent significant costs that could weigh on profitability in the near term. Amazon's size and market power have attracted increasing regulatory attention in recent years. Antitrust concerns, particularly regarding the company's dual role as both a marketplace operator and a seller on its own platform, could lead to regulatory actions that limit Amazon's ability to leverage its various business segments. Potential outcomes of regulatory scrutiny could include forced divestitures of certain business units, restrictions on data usage across different segments, or limitations on Amazon's ability to promote its own products on its platform. Such actions could significantly impact the company's business model and growth prospects. Additionally, increased regulatory compliance costs and potential fines could negatively affect Amazon's financial performance. Artificial intelligence and automation represent significant opportunities for Amazon to enhance efficiency and drive profitability across its various business segments. In its retail operations, AI can optimize inventory management, improve demand forecasting, and personalize customer experiences, potentially leading to higher sales and lower costs. In AWS, the growing demand for AI services presents a substantial revenue opportunity. As more companies seek to implement AI solutions, AWS is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this market. The integration of AI into Amazon's advertising platform could also lead to more effective ad targeting and higher ad revenues. Automation, particularly in Amazon's fulfillment centers and delivery operations, has the potential to significantly reduce labor costs and improve operational efficiency. The company's investments in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems could lead to substantial cost savings in the long term, potentially transforming the economics of e-commerce fulfillment. Project Kuiper, Amazon's satellite internet initiative, represents a significant long-term growth opportunity. While the initial investment is substantial, the potential market for global broadband internet access is vast. Analysts estimate that Project Kuiper could generate $2.8 billion in revenue by 2028, capturing a 17% market share of the satellite internet market. Beyond direct revenue from internet subscriptions, Project Kuiper could create synergies with Amazon's other business segments. It could expand Amazon's customer base by providing internet access to previously underserved areas, potentially increasing e-commerce sales and Prime subscriptions. Additionally, the satellite network could enhance Amazon's global logistics and data capabilities, supporting its retail and cloud computing operations. The project also positions Amazon to compete in the growing space economy, potentially opening up new revenue streams in areas such as satellite-based services for businesses and governments. While the full revenue potential of Project Kuiper may take years to materialize, it represents a strategic investment in Amazon's long-term growth and diversification. Amazon continues to navigate a complex landscape of opportunities and challenges as it seeks to maintain its position as a leader in e-commerce and cloud computing. While the company faces headwinds from increased competition and regulatory scrutiny, its diverse business model and investments in future technologies provide multiple avenues for growth. Investors and analysts will be closely watching Amazon's ability to execute on its strategic initiatives and maintain profitability in the face of evolving market conditions.

Full Content:
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a dominant force in the graphics processing unit (GPU) and artificial intelligence (AI) chip markets, continues to capture investor attention with its robust financial performance and strategic positioning in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. As the company navigates through a period of unprecedented growth and innovation, it faces both significant opportunities and potential hurdles. NVIDIA's financial trajectory has been nothing short of impressive. The company has consistently outperformed market expectations, with analysts projecting substantial revenue growth from $60.9 billion in fiscal year 2024 to over $200 billion by fiscal year 2027. This remarkable expansion is primarily driven by the surging demand for AI chips and accelerated computing solutions. Earnings per share (EPS) are expected to see a similar upward trend, with estimates ranging from $1.15 in FY2024 to as high as $4.85 by FY2027. This projected growth has led many analysts to maintain bullish outlooks on NVIDIA's stock, with price targets ranging from $135 to $180. Despite these positive projections, NVIDIA faces some near-term challenges. The company has reported potential gross margin pressures due to the transition to its next-generation "Blackwell" GPU architecture. Some analysts anticipate a temporary dip in margins as the company ramps up production of these new chips, though this is generally viewed as a short-term issue that should resolve as yields improve. At the heart of NVIDIA's success lies its relentless focus on innovation. The company's current flagship AI chip, the Hopper architecture, has seen strong demand from cloud service providers and enterprises alike. However, much attention is focused on the upcoming Blackwell GPU, which is expected to drive significant revenue growth in the coming years. Recent reports have indicated a slight delay in the Blackwell architecture due to performance issues and chip respins. While this has caused some concern among investors, many analysts view this as a minor setback in the broader context of NVIDIA's product roadmap. The company is expected to begin shipping customer samples of Blackwell in the near term, with volume production ramping up in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. NVIDIA's ability to quickly address technical challenges and provide alternative solutions has been a hallmark of its success. The company's CUDA programming platform continues to be a significant competitive advantage, offering developers a robust ecosystem for AI and high-performance computing applications. NVIDIA's dominance in the AI chip market is undeniable, with an estimated market share exceeding 95% in data center AI training and inference chips. This commanding position has allowed the company to capitalize on the explosive growth in AI investments across various industries. The total addressable market (TAM) for AI servers is expanding rapidly, with projections suggesting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 60% from 2023 to 2027. NVIDIA is well-positioned to capture a significant portion of this growth, given its strong relationships with hyperscalers and increasing penetration into enterprise markets. However, competition in the semiconductor space is intensifying. Rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are making significant investments in AI chip development, while cloud giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are exploring custom chip designs. NVIDIA's ability to maintain its technological edge and ecosystem advantages will be crucial in fending off these competitive threats. The data center segment has been the primary driver of NVIDIA's recent growth, with revenues in this area experiencing triple-digit year-over-year increases. This surge is largely attributed to the rapid adoption of AI and machine learning technologies across various industries. Hyperscale customers, including major cloud service providers, continue to invest heavily in AI infrastructure. Capital expenditure (CapEx) from these customers is seen as a key indicator of demand for NVIDIA's systems, with recent quarters showing significant growth. Some analysts project that peak CapEx spending may not occur until late 2025, suggesting a prolonged period of strong demand for NVIDIA's products. Enterprise adoption of AI technologies is also accelerating, presenting another avenue for growth. NVIDIA's efforts to expand its presence in on-premises AI solutions and edge computing are expected to contribute to its long-term revenue diversification. While AI and data center applications have taken center stage, NVIDIA's gaming business remains a significant contributor to its overall revenue. The company maintains a dominant position in the gaming GPU market, with a market share exceeding 75% in PC graphics cards. Analysts anticipate continued healthy demand from both esports enthusiasts and casual gamers, driven by ongoing product refresh cycles and the increasing graphical demands of modern games. NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud gaming service also represents a potential growth avenue as the company expands its presence in the gaming ecosystem. Other segments, such as professional visualization and automotive, are also showing promise. The automotive sector, in particular, is seen as a long-term growth opportunity as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies become more prevalent. Despite NVIDIA's strong market position and growth prospects, the company faces several risks that warrant investor attention. Geopolitical tensions, particularly those involving China and Taiwan, pose potential threats to NVIDIA's supply chain and market access. The company's heavy reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for chip production is a point of concern given the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties in the region. Additionally, the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential for market saturation in certain segments could impact NVIDIA's growth trajectory. The company's ability to maintain its technological lead and fend off increasing competition will be crucial in sustaining its current market position. As competitors like AMD and Intel ramp up their AI chip development efforts, NVIDIA may face increased pressure on its market share and pricing power. Custom chip designs from major cloud providers could also reduce reliance on NVIDIA's products in certain applications. This intensified competition could lead to margin compression and slower growth rates in the long term. While the reported delay in the Blackwell architecture is not expected to significantly impact NVIDIA's long-term earnings, repeated delays or technical issues could erode customer confidence and provide opportunities for competitors to gain ground. This could result in lost revenue opportunities and potential market share erosion in key segments. NVIDIA's strong position in the AI chip market, coupled with the rapidly expanding AI server TAM, presents significant growth opportunities. As AI adoption accelerates across industries, NVIDIA's full-stack ecosystem and technological advantages could allow it to capture a substantial portion of this growing market. The company's ability to innovate and provide end-to-end solutions for AI workloads positions it well for sustained long-term growth. The projected 60% CAGR in the AI server market from 2023 to 2027 represents a massive opportunity for NVIDIA. As enterprises increasingly adopt AI technologies for various applications, including inference at the edge, NVIDIA's diverse product portfolio and strong brand recognition could drive significant revenue growth. The company's efforts to expand into new verticals and geographies could further amplify these opportunities. NVIDIA Corporation continues to be a focal point for investors and analysts alike, with its strong market position in AI chips and GPUs driving optimistic outlooks. While the company faces challenges such as increased competition and potential product delays, its robust financial performance and strategic positioning in high-growth markets suggest significant potential for continued expansion. As NVIDIA navigates the evolving landscape of AI and accelerated computing, its ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial in maintaining its leadership position and delivering value to shareholders.

The only two vehicles that sold better were the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. The polarizing truck notched this achievement despite selling at its most expensive trim model in the early going. It’s also a sign of just how much trouble major automakers like Ford and General Motors have run into in finding customers for their own EVs. Automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book pegged Tesla’s Cybertruck sales as third-best last week, notching over 16,000 sales. Ford only sold around 7,000 F-150 Lightnings in the third quarter, and just over 13,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs, according to sales data from the automaker. GM has seemingly found some early success with its new Blazer and Equinox EVs, but still only sold around 32,000 electric vehicles total last quarter. Rivian only delivered around 3,800 of its own electric pickup. Tesla confirmed the third-best accomplishment Wednesday when it released its financial results for the third quarter. Tesla also noted that the Cybertruck generated a positive gross margin — a measure of profitability that is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from revenue. Tesla also revealed it generated $25.2 billion in sales during the quarter and notched a $2.2 billion profit. Tesla’s profit was boosted by $739 million in sales of regulatory credits to other automakers — the second-highest amount it’s ever sold in a quarter, behind the second quarter of this year when it sold $890 million worth. Tesla said its profits were also boosted by the fact that it started shipping its Actually Smart Summon feature and its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software to Cybertruck owners, which allowed the company to recognize some of the money owners paid up front as revenue. Tesla’s relentless cost-cutting also plays into its profit figure. Tesla said in the shareholder letter that the cost of goods sold per vehicle is down to $35,100. Those Q3 figures helped push Tesla’s stock price up more than 9% in after-hours trading. Cost-cutting isn’t helping every part of the business, though. Tesla reported a 20% year-over-year growth in Supercharger stations, its slowest growth figure in years. This comes after Tesla gutted — and then started rehiring some of — its Supercharger team earlier this year as part of a massive company-wide layoff.

Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) plans to use Denmark's first sovereign artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer—powered by Nvidia (NVDA) technology—for drug discovery. On Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and King Frederik X of Denmark unveiled "Gefion": a supercomputer named after a goddess in Danish mythology and equipped with 1,528 Nvidia GPUs. Sovereign AI refers to a nation’s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks, Nvidia said. "The era of computer-aided drug discovery must be within this decade," Huang said in a news release. "I’m hoping that what the computer did to the technology industry, it will do for digital biology." The Novo Nordisk Foundation owns the supercomputer, and Novo Nordisk — the company behind popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy— will be among the first to use it. The foundation owns all of Novo Nordisk's Class A shares, which represent about a quarter of the company's capital. Nvidia and Denmark are “inventing something fundamentally new,” with the launch of Gefion, Huang said. “Gefion is going to be a factory of intelligence," Huang said. "This is a new industry that never existed before. It sits on top of the IT industry.” Novo Nordisk, along with the University of Copenhagen and others, are building a “genomic foundation model for discoveries in disease mutation analysis and vaccine design,” by training larger language models on Gefion. Other Gefion pilot projects include a Danish Meteorological Institute effort to deliver faster and more accurate weather forecasts and a University of Copenhagen project to carry out a large-scale simulation of quantum computer circuits.

GPUs, or graphic processing units, have become increasingly difficult to acquire as tech giants like OpenAI and Meta purchase mountains of them to power A.I. models. Amid an ongoing chip shortage, a crop of startups are stepping up to increase access to the highly sought-after A.I. chips—by renting them out. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. The GPU rental market is part of a niche, existing industry known as GPU-as-a-service where chip owners use an online marketplace to sell compute power to clients over fixed periods of time through the cloud. Typically, companies turn to major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud—which collectively hold a 63 percent market share of the global cloud computing market—to run A.I. workloads on their on-premise data centers. GPU-as-as-service, however, provides a more decentralized approach. Providers in that space partner with data centers and GPU owners globally to rent their clusters of chips to clients whenever the need arises. Renting computer power allows organizations with tight budgets, such as startups and academic institutions, access to high-performance GPUs for specific projects, said David Bader, director of the Institute for Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. “GPU-as-a-service has significantly leveled the playing field in A.I. and high-performance computing,” Bader told Observer. “Instead of making substantial upfront investments in hardware that quickly depreciates and becomes obsolete, companies can now access GPU power on-demand.” Even as supply chain constraints around GPUs start to ease, the rental market continues to grow. The GPU-as-a-service market, valued at $3.79 billion as of 2023, is expected to grow 21.5 percent annually to $12.26 billion by 2030 as the demand for advanced data analytics, like running machine learning algorithms, increases, according to data from Grand View Research. Some startups in the GPU rental space have seen demand surging since ChatGPT came out in November of 2022 as companies seek out compute power to build A.I. Jake Cannell, founder and CEO of Vast.ai, said his company’s customers were primarily cryptocurrency miners before the generative A.I. hype began. Today, more than half of the projects run on Vast.ai’s GPU rentals are A.I.-related. Clients include A.I. entrepreneurs, startups and academics building custom large language models with foundational models like OpenAI’s GPT and deploying LLMs on A.I.-related workloads like A.I.-image generator Stable Diffusion, Cannell said. The release of ChatGPT, combined with high demand for major cloud providers and the GPU shortage, pushed more customers to look for alternative options, which has in part accelerated demand for Vast.ai’s GPU rentals, according to Cannell. “That’s probably relaxed a bit now that production has caught up, but demand still seems really high and growing,” the CEO said. Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang recently said demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips has been “insane” and that the company, which owns about 90 percent of the GPU market, plans to ramp up Blackwell production this year through 2026. Launched in 2017, Vast.ai is behind an online marketplace that connects owners of GPU clusters from Nvidia and AMD with organizations looking to rent compute power. As of late October, the marketplace offers 109 clusters of GPUs—including Nvidia’s popular H100 chips—housed in data centers and, in some cases, the owners’ garages scattered across the U.S. Europe, Asia and Australia, according to Cannell. By offering GPU clusters with different capacities, speeds and system requirements for various lengths of time, Vast.ai aims to provide renters with the freedom to pick GPUs required for specific projects and scale up-and-down depending on their need. For instance, a client developing an A.I. chatbot may initially rent 100 GPUs to train their model. If their product takes off, the client could ramp up their compute capacity by renting out thousands of GPUs. The flexibility to access different amounts of compute at different stages of product development, the company claims, is what makes GPU rentals over purchasing chips appealing. “Buying would only make sense if you have a much more predictable, steady demand for GPUs over a very long period of time,” Cannell said. “Only the hypercalers can formulate that,” referring to industry giants like OpenAI. While startups like Vast.ai launched prior to ChatGPT are seeing an uptick in interest, new startups have emerged following the chatbot’s release to tap into the growing GPU rental market. Foundry, a GPU marketplace built specifically for A.I. workloads, claims it has attracted “dozens” of customers since it launched its cloud platform in August and can significantly reduce compute costs by tapping into the excess power supply of pre-existing chips, according to CEO Jared Quincy Davis. The startup, which raised $80 million from investors like Sequoia and Lightspeed Ventures as of March, rents out GPUs through a mix of compute clusters the company owns and “underutilized clusters” sourced from partnerships with data centers. Foundry’s customers include companies in the technology, telecommunications, media and health care industries. Foundations and academic labs also use Foundry’s services. Common use cases include fine-tuning models like Meta’s Llama to exhibit desirable properties, building neural networks from scratch, and performing sentiment analyses—a deep learning technique used to analyze text to determine its emotional tone. Foundry even has clients renting GPUs to predict protein sequences for drug discovery, train models to translate rare languages, and build A.I. agents that can control websites without human intervention. “Much of the cutting-edge development that could previously only be conducted by labs like OpenAI and DeepMind will now be obtainable by others as Foundry makes GPU compute more accessible and affordable,” Davis, who previously worked at Google DeepMind as an engineer, told Observer. Some organizations are seeing the benefits of GPU rentals materialize. Bader, the professor at New Jersey Institute of Technology, said he’s seen his university use the GPU rental approach to “free up resources” for “critical activities” like research and development. The GPU rental model, he claims, is ideal for projects with “temporary” or “seasonal compute needs” and “eliminates the burden” of costly hardware management and maintenance. Bader said he has also seen small businesses the university collaborates with access the same GPU power as larger businesses. “I’ve witnessed countless startups benefit from this,” Bader said. “They no longer need millions in upfront investment for specialized hardware. Instead, they can prototype, test and iterate their algorithms using rented GPUs, ensuring that funds are directed towards development rather than infrastructure.” Still, Bader noted that renting out GPUs over purchasing them comes with some trade-offs. Performance on shared infrastructure can be inconsistent, which could slow down the execution of tasks like A.I. model training if there’s service disruptions. GPU rentals could also get expensive down the line despite upfront cost savings. The costs of transferring data between the cloud and the company could “add up quickly,” and for workloads that require real-time processing, clients that continuously hit latency issues might end up paying more than if they owned GPUs, according to Bader. The lack of control over the infrastructure could also be “problematic” for companies with strict security and compliance protocols. The future of the GPU rental market could also depend on how the chip industry evolves. After all, major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services are expected to continue expanding their product lines and are likely to absorb smaller companies, which could lower prices in the short term and limit consumer choice in the long run, according to Bader. Plus, supply chain delays could make it harder for cloud giants to get their hands on GPUs. Despite these concerns, the startups that spoke to Observer remain confident there will still be a need for their services in the following years as A.I. continues to grow. Vast.ai continues to improve its GPU matchmaker service and is getting more directly involved in use cases like LLM inference, especially for A.I. agents. Foundry plans to release additional features to increase the accessibility for its platform and make it more useful for A.I. developers to build advanced models. “Nvidia is still a leader, and I don’t see that changing overnight, but there is increasingly more competition,” Vast.ai CEO Cannnell said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Artificial Intelligence has driven shares of tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to new highs this year. But the technology, which companies promise will revolutionize our lives, is driving something else just as high as stock prices: energy consumption. AI data centers use huge amounts of power and could increase energy demand by as much as 20% over the next decade, according to a Department of Energy spokesperson. Pair that with the continued growth of the broader cloud computing market, and you’ve got an energy squeeze. But Big Tech has also set ambitious sustainability goals focused on the use of low-carbon and zero-carbon sources to reduce its impact on climate change. While renewable energy like solar and wind are certainly part of that equation, tech companies need uninterruptible power sources. And for that, they’re leaning into nuclear power. Tech giants aren’t just planning to hook into existing plants, either. They’re working with energy companies to bring mothballed facilities like Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island back online and looking to build small modular reactors (SMRs) that take up less space than traditional plants and, the hope is, are cheaper to construct. But there are still plenty of questions as to whether these investments in nuclear energy will ever pan out, not to mention how long it will take to build any new reactors. While solar and wind power projects provide clean energy, they still aren't the best option for continuous power. That, experts say, is where nuclear energy comes in. “Nuclear energy is, effectively, carbon-free,” explained Ed Anderson, Gartner distinguished vice president and analyst. “So it becomes a pretty natural choice given they need the energy, and they need green energy. Nuclear [power] is a good option for that.” The US currently generates the bulk of its electricity via natural gas plants that expel greenhouse gases. As of 2023, nuclear power produced slightly more electricity than coal, as well as solar power plants. Last week, Google signed a deal to purchase power from Kairos Power’s small modular reactors, with Google saying the first reactor should be online by 2030, with plants expected to be deployed in regions to power Google’s data centers, though Kairos didn’t provide exact locations. Amazon quickly followed by saying just two days later that it is investing in three companies — Energy Northwest, X-energy, and Dominion Energy — to develop SMRs. The plan is for Energy Northwest to build SMRs using technology from X-energy in Washington State and for Amazon and Dominion Energy to look at building an SMR near Dominion’s current North Anna Power Station in Virginia. Last month, Microsoft entered into a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Constellation Energy, under which the company will source energy from one of Constellation's previously shuttered reactors at Three Mile Island by 2028. Three Mile Island suffered a meltdown of its other reactor in 1979, but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there was no serious impact to nearby people, plants, or animals, as the plant itself kept much of the dangerous radiation from escaping. In 2023, Microsoft announced it would source power from the Sam Altman-chaired nuclear fusion startup Helion by 2028. Altman also chairs the nuclear fission company Oklo, which plans to build a micro-reactor site in Idaho. Nuclear fusion is the long-sought process of combining atoms that produces power without dangerous nuclear waste. No commercial applications of such plants currently exist. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also founded and currently chairs TerraPower, a company working to develop an advanced nuclear plant at a site in Wyoming. Nuclear power output has remained stagnant for years. According to US Energy Information Administration press officer, Chris Higginbotham, nuclear power has contributed about 20% of US electricity generation since 1990. Part of the reason has to do with the fear of meltdowns, like the one at Three Mile Island, as well as the meltdowns at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011. Chernobyl was the worst meltdown ever, spreading radioactive contamination across areas of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Belarus, resulting in thyroid cancer in thousands of children who drank milk that was contaminated with radioactive iodine, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Plant workers and emergency personnel were also exposed to high levels of radiation at the scene. The Fukushima plant suffered multiple meltdowns as a result of a massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which caused significant damage to three of the plant's six reactors. But according to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) as of 2021, “no adverse health effects among Fukushima residents have been documented that could be directly attributed to radiation exposure from the accident.” Outside of the perception, nuclear plants are expensive and take time to construct. Georgia Power’s two Vogtle reactors came online in 2023 and 2024, after years of delays and billions in cost overruns. The reactors, known as Unit 3 and Unit 4 were originally expected to be completed in 2017 and cost $14 billion, but the second reactor only started commercial operations in April this year. The final price tag for the work is estimated to top out at $31 billion, according to the Associated Press. The explosion in cheap energy from natural gas has also made it difficult for nuclear plants to compete financially. Now nuclear companies are hoping SMRs will lead the way in building out new nuclear energy capacity. But don’t expect them to start popping up for a while. “The SMR conversation is really long term,” Jefferies managing director and research analyst Paul Zimbardo told Yahoo Finance. “I'd say almost all of the projections are into the 2030s. The Amazons, the Googles, some of the standalone SMR developers, 2030 to 2035, which is also what some of the utilities are saying as well.” What’s more, Zimbardo says, power generated by SMRs is expected to cost far more than traditional plants, not to mention wind and solar projects. “Some of the projections are well above $100 a megawatt hour,” Zimbardo explained. “To put it in context, an existing nuclear plant has a cost profile of around $30 a megawatt hour. Building new wind, solar, depending on where you are in the country, can be as low as $30 a megawatt hour, or $60 to $80 a megawatt hour. So it's a very costly solution.” Not everyone is buying the promise of SMRs, either. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the small-scale reactors are still an untested technology. “Despite what one might think of all the brain power at these tech companies, I don't think they've done their due diligence,” Lyman told Yahoo Finance. “Or they're willing to entertain this as a kind of side show just so they have all their bases covered to deal with this postulated massive expansion and demand for data centers.” Lyman also takes issue with the idea that SMRs will be able to get up and running quickly and begin providing reliable power around the clock at low cost. “The historical development of nuclear power shows that it's a very exacting technology, and it requires time, requires effort, requires a lot of money and patience,” he said. “And so I think the nuclear industry has been trying to make itself look relevant, despite their recent failures to meet cost and timeliness targets.” Still, with tech companies promising an AI revolution that requires power-hungry data centers, nuclear may be the only realistic green choice until solar and wind can take over permanently.

Title: What CIOs and other tech leaders are prioritizing as they plan their 2025 budgets
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/23/what-cios-and-other-tech-leaders-are-prioritizing-as-they-plan-their-2025-budgets/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T19:09:33Z
Full Content:
As Mike Anderson plans tech spending for next year, the technology leader is asking all of Netskope’s vendors for fresh updates about their generative artificial intelligence product roadmap and pricing plans. “We’re not making any long-term commitments to any software providers,” says Anderson, who serves as chief digital and information officer at the cloud-based security company. “The change is happening so rapidly.” Surveys have consistently shown that chief information officers and other technology C-suite leaders will spend more on generative AI next year. But now two years into the generative AI journey, they are also thinking more about getting a return on those investments, while also expressing increased skepticism about how AI is priced. The per-user cost for AI copilots, often $30 for each employee, is a frequent pain point. There is also wariness about “AI washing,” which is the notion that vendors are adding fees for flimsy new AI features with little to no business value. “A lot of people are scratching their heads,” says Anderson. “I don’t really know if I can afford $30 per user.” McKinsey senior partner Aamer Baig agrees, sharing “It’s safe to say the CIOs are very irritated by these enterprise vendors pricing strategies for generative AI.” CIOs say they are intrigued and even welcome some recent industry pricing pivots, most notably by Salesforce, to consumption-based pricing. “If I get to a point where I have good predictability around what my usage is, I’m sure that the vendors will negotiate some type of a contract that helps me control my costs,” says Anderson. Baig says McKinsey’s clients are paying attention to the one-time costs of AI investments, but also discovering that for every $1 spent on developing an AI model, they are spending $3 on change management, meaning training staff and actively tracking their performance and the value of their investments in the technology. “There have been some surprises,” says Baig. Principal Financial CIO Kathy Kay says the financial investment management and insurance company has evolved budget planning from an annual cycle to a quarterly cadence, allowing for more fluidity to move dollars depending on new priorities or changes to the business. Kay says she will spend more on generative AI in 2025, but that the core function of IT is to also find ways to do work cheaper and faster. “I’m not a proponent of just asking to increase my spending without good business rationale,” says Kay. Dave Williams, chief information and digital officer at Merck, anticipates the pharmaceuticals company will also increase spending on generative AI, as well as cybersecurity, edge computing, drug development, and to make manufacturing more efficient. “We see a huge opportunity to leverage cloud, gen AI, and the combination [of those technologies], to accelerate the core of what we do, which is get new vaccines and medicines to patients faster,” says Williams. Rajeev Rajan, chief technology officer for Atlassian, says the software provider is “very prudent about how much we spend on R&D. We look at our overall revenue, our overall budget, and we keep it in good proportion.” He’s also spending more on AI, but a yearslong project to get customers to migrate data from on-premise to the cloud is wrapping up, requiring less funding. Atticus Tysen, Intuit’s chief information security officer, says the financial software company starts annual budget planning by first allocating dollars toward security, and then everything else. “As the CISO and the CIO, I have to be careful about that and not take up all the money,” says Tysen. One big priority for 2025 is Intuit’s continued embrace of a multi-cloud strategy. While Intuit primarily leans on Amazon Web Services, it has acquired brands, like Credit Karma, which have built their data processing on rival offerings. By working with more than one cloud provider, Intuit can select the best service from AWS or Microsoft or Google that will match a specific need. “There’s no reason to really move or change that,” says Tysen, regarding keeping Credit Karma on Google Cloud Platform. “They wouldn’t get any customer benefit out of it. There wouldn’t be any particular cost savings.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. AI agents still come with a lot of questions. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at the emerging world of AI agents, which rely on generative AI and promise to follow more intricate instructions than a chatbot. But big questions remain on how much human intervention will be needed, the best governance to protect the data that’s being used in a new way, and what kind of autonomous decision-making will be allowed for AI agents versus prior forms of automation. There’s also the ongoing issue of the price that vendors hope to command, either through per-user or outcome-based fees, and what businesses are ultimately willing to pay. OpenAI and Bain strike AI partnership; but tension emerges with Microsoft. OpenAI and Bain & Co. are expanding their pact to sell ChatGPT and other tools to clients of the consulting firm, the Wall Street Journal reports, and Bain is putting about 50 employees into the joint effort to build industry-specific AI tools, something many tech leaders have been waiting for. Separately, the New York Times has reported on tension between OpenAI and Microsoft, which has already put $13 billion into the upstart. At issue: OpenAI's desire to secure more computing power and reduce expenses, and Microsoft's worries about becoming too reliant on OpenAI for its AI advancements. Meta announces fresh rounds of layoffs. The social media giant, which announced mass rounds of layoffs in 2022 and 2023, will lay off about 100 employees across various departments, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, Fortune reported. The latest cuts are due to reorganizing the structure of those teams to align with long-term strategic goals, Meta says, differing from the larger, mass layoffs in the past couple of years. Separately, Meta fired some staffers from the Los Angeles office for abusing the company’s $25 meal stipend and spending money from the corporate perk on groceries, household items, and meals when they weren’t even in the office. Gopuff fires CTO months after battery arrest. Sreekant Kotay, who has served as CTO for grocery-delivery company Gopuff, was reportedly fired on Friday several months after he was arrested on a felony battery charge and for alleged possession of illegal drugs, The Information reports. Citing court records, the outlet also reports that Kotay has pleaded not guilty to all three charges. Kotay has served as CTO of Gopuff for two stints, from 2017 through 2019 and again in early 2023 until he was ousted last week. He's also previously served as CTO at Comcast and as SVP of technology at AOL. Most companies still aren’t data-ready for generative AI. A new report by IT consulting firm Accenture found that six out of ten "reinvention-ready" companies—the early movers on generative AI—have their data assets modernized for gen AI use cases, have clear data governance, and are able to trace their data from the original source through the AI lifecycle. All other companies, that fall into less advanced AI criteria like "automated" or "foundational," aren't as far along in their AI data readiness journey. One barrier that automated and foundational companies face is that their data sits with a wide array of vendors, but there are often slight data variations, preventing “a single source of truth,” says Laura Peterson, senior managing director at Accenture. “It is actually core to being able to run your business in a different way,” says Peterson, regarding the importance of performing “data cleanup” that’s more comprehensive than a one-time event that tends to be tied to system updates. She also advises that IT and business leaders partner to get on the same page and make it a priority.

Title: Dow Drops 500 Points To 2-Week Low As Magnificent 7 Sheds $430 Billion

A rare down week for the stock market got dimmer Wednesday, as an $11 billion hamburger selloff and big-ticket losses for big technology stocks pushed U.S. equity indexes to their worst day in six weeks. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The leading S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.6% and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1%, or 410 points. The Dow and Nasdaq suffered their worst daily declines since the first week of September and all three registered their lowest close in two weeks. Contributing most to the share price-weighted Dow’s dip was McDonald’s, as its stock’s 5% ($15 per share) loss Wednesday sent shares of the restaurant chain to their worst day since March 2020 as investors reacted to news of an E. Coli outbreak tied to its Quarter Pounder hamburger. The market capitalization-weighted Nasdaq and S&P were dragged down by big tech, as the “magnificent seven” group including the U.S.’ only six trillion-dollar companies and Tesla fell shed a combined $352 billion in Wednesday trading. Each of the magnificent seven stocks dropped at least 0.7%: Amazon, Facebook parent Meta and Nvidia shares fell about 3% apiece, Apple and Tesla declined 2%, Google parent Alphabet lost 1.4% and Microsoft dipped 0.7%. In addition to isolated catalysts like the McDonald’s foodborne illness agita and an analyst report pointing to lighter-than-hoped sales for Apple’s iPhone 16, there was a familiar foe behind much of the losses: climbing Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose Wednesday to a 3-month high of over 4.25%. The increase comes amid fresh worries about what next month’s election will mean for the U.S’ surging national debt and declining expectations for further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the wake of inflation concerns and solid economic growth data. Higher yields on government bonds often lead to pricier corporate borrowing, eating into profit margins, and big tech companies are typically seen as one of the groups most directly hurt by higher yields as future profits are discounted in valuation models. Even with the S&P well on its way to its first three-day losing streak since the first week of September, the baseline U.S. index is still just 1.6% below its all-time closing high set Friday. The S&P remains up 21% this year, excluding dividends, and it has climbed 0.2% in October after posting its best opening nine months since 1997. Tesla will report third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, kicking off big tech earnings season. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk wants the FDA to stop pharmacies from making off-brand versions of popular weight loss meds
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-fda-ozempic-wegovy-1851679536
Time Published: 2024-10-23T17:42:59Z
Full Content:
Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) is asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prohibit compounding pharmacies from making off-brand versions of semaglutide, the active ingredient in its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes medications. The Danish pharma giant argued in documents submitted to the agency this week that the drug is too complex for pharmacies to make safely and that it belongs in the FDA’s Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding Lists. Drugs included in these lists are off-limits for compounding pharmacies, regardless of a drug’s shortage status. The move comes as both Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly, the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, are trying to curb the sale of off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have become highly sought after for their remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Normally, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act bans compounding drugs that are just copies of existing medications. However, if a drug is in short supply, it’s not seen as commercially available by the FDA. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight-loss drugs during recent shortages. Novo Nordisk told the FDA that its testing of compounded formulations of semaglutide found impurities that could put patients at risk. An industry group has already come out against those claims. “So Novo Nordisk is apparently so deeply concerned about patient safety that it’s taken them a whopping two-and-a-half years while their drug has been in shortage to conclude that the semaglutide API [active pharmaceutical ingredient] is so demonstrably difficult for compounding pharmacies to prepare that FDA now needs to place it off-limits for compounding?” said Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding CEO Scott Brunner in statement emailed to Quartz. “To me, this looks more like desperation and an attempt by Novo to protect its revenue stream than a serious scientific argument,” Brunner added. Earlier this month, the FDA marked the shortage of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, as resolved. Eli Lilly (LLY) quickly started sending cease-and-desist letters to any company selling copycat versions. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association filed a lawsuit in Texas against the FDA, challenging its decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, obtained by Ars Technica, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” In a court filing, the FDA said pharmacists could resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list. While compounding is now temporarily allowed, Eli Lilly has shifted its strategy to filing false advertising lawsuits against medical spas and online sellers marketing tirzepatide products.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Warren Buffett, Bill Gates Weigh In (Update)

Time Published: 2024-10-23T16:23:28Z
Full Content:
Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 81 billionaires supporting Harris and 52 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: Ellison and Griffin are perhaps the most surprising billionaires who have stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering both have donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Griffin (Citadel) confirmed Thursday he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), while Griffin, the 39th-wealthiest, had been a Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) supporter. A total of 81 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: (Updated Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. A total of 52 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: (Updated Oct. 16) The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings. He gave another $43.6 million to a pro-Trump committee from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, becoming the second-most prolific donor in Trump’s camp this year, trailing only Adelson. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. (Updated Oct. 22): The New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. Tangent A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: How To Profit As AI, And Jay Powell, Send Energy Stocks Soaring

(Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Last week’s oil-price drop has set us up to buy some top-flight energy dividends on the cheap. We’re going to grab one with a “hidden” 10.3% yield in just a moment. First, this buy window goes well beyond a dip in the price of the goo. Fact is, oil dropped because things calmed (slightly) in the Middle East. But of course, that can change again, and quickly. The real oil story for us is that the drop (along with a double-digit decline in natural-gas prices since the start of October) is happening as energy demand is set to rise. So desperate is the need for energy these days that Big Tech is turning to long-shuttered nuclear reactors. Microsoft (MSFT), for example, recently signed a deal with Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island—site of America’s worst nuclear accident, in 1979—to generate the power needed to satisfy AI’s voracious appetite. Meantime, I continue to believe that a “no-landing” setup is increasingly likely here in the US, in which the economy keeps humming along but inflation comes back. Not great, I know. But the fact is, when the Fed hikes rates, it usually does so until it breaks something—the main example being Paul Volcker, who was so determined to break inflation’s back that under his watch, the federal funds rate hit 22% (!). Inflation was crushed, but the hike sent the US into a deep recession, with unemployment soaring to 11% in 1982. Jay? He “broke” a couple marginal banks that were circling the drain anyway. But that was enough to cause him to blink and pump liquidity into the system through the “back door” while continuing to talk tough on rates, as this chart of bank reserves clearly shows: Liquidity Meantime, as we’ve written about previously, government deficit spending is completely out of control. It is possible, perhaps probable, that Uncle Sam will overwhelm Powell. For fiscal 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a $1.9 trillion deficit on $4.9 trillion in tax receipts. (And yes, this is the CBO that paints its projections with rose-colored ink.) So we have nearly $5 trillion in revenues and almost $7 trillion in expenditures. A 40% overshoot. That $2 trillion is a big reason why the economy remains strong (the latest evidence: last week’s better-than-expected retail sales report and lower than expected jobless claims). But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation. Then there’s China, which joined the stimulus party a few weeks back, when its central bank rolled out a sweeping set of stimulus measures. The PBoC lowered interest rates (including mortgage rates) and announced “stock market support” plans to help companies buy back their own shares and to allow investors to borrow against their portfolios. Shares of Chinese firms, as well as resources like copper, popped. And while it will take a while for the PBoC’s moves to work through the economy, they’ll likely boost energy demand, too. This is a perfect setup for refiners like Phillips 66 (PSX), since they’re paying less for their main raw material (oil) these days, while demand for their finished products (gasoline, diesel and home-heating oil among them) look set to gain. Investors often misunderstand refiners, confusing them with oil and gas producers. And when they do bother to pay attention to these stocks, it’s usually in the spring, ahead of the summer driving season. (PSX has some 7,260 gas stations in the US and 1,670 outside America’s borders.) That’s too bad for the mainstream crowd, because they’re missing a window on a stock that’s sent its payout up a stout 130% over the last decade, with the only pause coming during the pandemic dumpster fire: PSX Dividend Magnet As you can see, the firm’s share price has struggled to keep up with the surging payout. But I expect that gap to close as PSX’s Dividend Magnet (or the tendency for share prices to track payouts over time) kicks in. Moreover, while we collect that payout, and get ready for more hikes, seasonal demand will swing back PSX’s way as we move through the colder months. The kicker here is that management is all-in when it comes to rewarding shareholders. In addition to its strong payout growth, Phillips 66 is a big repurchaser of its stock—having taken some 23% of its outstanding shares off the market in the last decade. That matters because those buybacks make per-share indicators like earnings per share, free cash flow per share and dividends per share look better. That supports share prices. That tees up the last thing I want to talk to you about today: shareholder yield. Wait, shareholder what? We know from the free screeners out there that PSX’s current dividend yield is around 3.5%. Simple, right? But shareholder yield goes further and includes the value of dividends and buybacks to us. To calculate it, we take the amount spent on buybacks over the last 12 months, minus any cash brought in through share issuances, plus the amount spent on dividends. We then divide the total by PSX’s market cap, or the value of all its outstanding shares. For PSX, the difference between the dividend yield and shareholder yield is dramatic: For the 12 months ended June 30, PSX spent $1.855 billion on dividends and a whopping $3.909 billion on buybacks, with $175 million in share issuances, which we’ll go ahead and subtract. Divide the $4.014-billion total by PSX’s $55.71-billion market cap (as of this writing) and you get a sweet 10.3% shareholder yield. PSX’s shareholder-friendliness is another reason why I see investors moving to this stock, especially as interest rates fall and economic growth—and energy demand—rise.

Title: Stock Market Predictions For 2025: What Is Coming Next Year?

getty Explore stock market predictions for 2025 and what may be coming next year. Learn key trends, forecasts, and insights to help guide your investment decisions. (search description) So far, 2024 is shaping up to be a strong year for stocks. With interest rates expected to fall further, it's easy to assume next year could be another win for equity investors—if only the financial markets were that simple. In reality, there are real risks and uncertainties in play for 2025. While many analysts expect the year to be positive for stocks, several factors could introduce volatility along the way. Prepare yourself for what may lie ahead with this expert-informed overview of risks, sectors to watch and S&P 500 predictions for next year. Through mid-October, the S&P 500 is up 22.5% year to date. The growth followed last year's gain of 24%. 2022 was less profitable. In that year, the S&P 500 fell nearly 20%. You may remember that 2022 was the year the Fed began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Those moves raised bond yields, encouraging investors to shift away from stocks in favor of debt securities. This rise-and-fall cycle is typical for the U.S. stock market and economy. The good times typically last longer, but weaker financial markets and economies can be more traumatic—emotionally and financially. The thing to remember is that no stock market climate is permanent. Whether stock prices are heading up or down, there is always a reversal ahead. Keeping that in mind can help you manage whatever's in store for 2025 and beyond.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days Pundits are largely optimistic about the U.S. financial markets in 2025, but with a good dose of caution. Global financial markets are more intertwined today than ever, which makes U.S. stocks more sensitive to a broader range of factors. Five factors to watch in 2025 are the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, domestic inflation and interest rates, technology innovation, global economic trends and rising geopolitical tensions. I expand on each of these factors below. Justin Zacks, vice president of strategy at Moomoo Technologies, and Michael Martin, vice president of market strategy at TradingBlock, expect the 2024 presidential election to have a major influence on the stock market next year. Zacks believes the first 100 days of either president's term will set the tone for the next four years. Martin points to the U.S. tariff policy and the national deficit as hot-button issues for the next president. New tariffs could slow the U.S. economy, Martin explains, which in turn could cause inflation worries to linger into 2026 and beyond. The deficit, unchecked, could contribute to the continued devaluation of the U.S. dollar. A breakdown of trust in the U.S. dollar could push investors to "alternative stores of value like gold and bitcoin," according to Martin. The Fed lowered interest rates in September after inflation finally dipped below 3% over the summer. Many analysts expect the Fed to continue cutting rates in small increments as inflation drops softly down to 2%. Unfortunately there are risks to this plan. Zacks believes there is a possibility we'll see stagflation next year, for example. Stagflation is persistent inflation despite a softening economy and labor market. He cites changing tariff policies and geopolitical tensions as potential catalysts. Martin questions whether the Fed's 2% inflation target is realistic. If it's not and rates remain higher as a new normal, profit margins could suffer. Broadly lower profitability will stifle stock market growth. Technological innovation has recently been a primary growth driver for the stock market, creating some of the best stocks of 2024. As an example, semiconductor company Nvidia (NVDA) has increased its stock price by 178% by decisively monetizing demand for high-performance computing resources. Nvidia's graphics processing units are a preferred resource for machine learning workloads. For better or worse, the stock market will respond to further developments in artificial intelligence in 2025. One uncertainty is whether AI can deliver on its promises of efficiency and productivity. Billions are being spent on AI development and the return expectations are high. Many experts believe AI will prove itself, fueling higher earnings expectations and, in turn, higher stock prices. Angelina Hu, global head of investor relations at SALT Venture Group, cites ongoing economic slowness in China as a potential limitation for stock market growth in 2025. A sluggish Chinese economy weakens demand for U.S. exports. China's finance ministry has announced plans for a stimulus package, but the details of that program are still unknown. Companies with significant exposure to China may experience volatility as the stimulus plans take shape. Thus far, the war in Ukraine and rising conflict in the Middle East have not created major problems in the U.S. financial markets. This could change if unrest escalates to the point of disrupting global trade or commodities supply, according to Zacks. Another concern is the engagement of U.S. troops on foreign soil, which would likely sour investor sentiment and take a toll on stock prices in the process.

Elevate your journey by becoming a Forbes member. Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days Three sectors to watch next year are technology, healthcare and energy. For added context, see this list of the best investing sectors for 2024. Market intelligence company IDC expects worldwide spending on AI to more than double between 2024 and 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29%. The investments will go towards AI-enabled applications, hardware, including semiconductors, storage systems and servers, plus related services such as cloud computing. McKinsey has predicted healthcare profits will grow at a 7% CAGR between 2022 and 2027. Expected profit drivers after 2024 include cost efficiencies and higher reimbursement rates. Industry-wide margin expansion will be supported by greater use of health services and technology (HST) firms. HST firms help insurance companies, health systems and life-sciences companies identify revenue opportunities and cut costs with data and analytics. This is expected to be a fast-growing segment within healthcare. With a growing tech sector comes higher energy demands. For context, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has estimated that AI chatbots like ChatGPT use 10 times the electricity of an internet search. In 2023, fossil fuels accounted for 60% of U.S. electricity generation, while renewable energy sources provided 21%. Fossil fuels will continue to play an important role in the energy ecosystem in the near term. Renewable solar, wind and hydro power will also see greater demand, particularly from data centers and technology companies. Expert predictions for stock market growth in 2025 vary from a 5% decline to growth of 20%. Many pundits are pegging a 10% increase as the most likely scenario. Richard McWhorter, managing partner of Private Wealth Advisor, predicts a range of -5% to 5%, for example. McWhorter cites the elevated multiple of the S&P 500 as a primary factor. He believes earnings must grow into that multiple before the market can deliver double-digit growth. Ed Mahaffy, president and senior portfolio manager at ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, has a more bullish outlook. Citing ongoing innovation in AI and falling interest rates, Mahaffy expects the S&P 500 will end 2025 up 14.5% to 19.6%. Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and chief investment officer for Running Point Capital Advisors, holds a midrange view. Schulman believes the S&P 500 will grow 7% to 11% next year, with volatility along the way. He notes economic growth, earnings expansion, rising mergers and acquisitions activity and lower interest rates as influential factors. As of October, the S&P 500 is hovering around 5,850. If the index declines 5% in 2025, it will end the year at about 5,557. If the index grows 20% next year, it will end the year at about 7,000. Ten percent growth equates to a year-end value of 6,435. Volatility will be a primary challenge for investors in 2025. Uncertainty about the factors noted above, from the outcome of the U.S. election to foreign conflicts, almost ensure the market will have good days and bad ones. High valuations could exacerbate the ups and downs as investors oscillate between fear and greed. Zacks notes that the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is well above its 20-year average. Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) are major contributors. For context, see this prediction for Tesla stock in 2025. "Companies' earnings will need to continue to grow to justify such valuations," Zacks explains. If earnings come in weaker than expected—for any reason—2025 could be a rough year. Considering the uncertainties at hand, how should you prep your portfolio for next year? Two areas that may warrant adjustments are the composition of your income portfolio and your sector exposures. If you have adjusted your income holdings to favor high-yield cash deposits and bonds in recent years, it may be time to unwind those changes. As interest rates fall, cash deposits will drop, too—making dividend yields look relatively more attractive. Dividend stocks have the additional appeal of having relatively low volatility. These can offer downside protection if the market does get rocky. Sector adjustments can help you capitalize if the Fed continues lowering interest rates. Capital-intensive sectors like technology and industrials tend to get a lift when rates fall. Consumer discretionary stocks will also benefit if cheaper debt encourages spending growth. More consumers may, for example, splurge on luxury vacations or new cars if these can be financed affordably. Banks and consumer staples stocks, on the other hand, are less attractive in lower-rate environments. Banks can see their margins shrink when rates fall, while consumer staples companies can be less popular with investors in growth economies. The prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. Momentum in technology innovation and lower interest rates are generally good for the stock market, but high valuations, global tensions and uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election could pose risks. Now may be the time to diversify across growth and value. Blended exposure offers gain potential plus volatility protection—the best of both worlds. The technology, healthcare and energy sectors are predicted to perform well in 2025. If inflation remains low, the Fed will continue reducing interest rates. Falling interest rates usually have a positive impact on stock prices. Lingering high inflation would sour investor sentiment and put downward pressure on stock prices. Growth stocks and value stocks can play a role in 2025. Many experts believe the stock market will be up next year, albeit with volatility. Growth stocks can provide appreciation potential, while value stocks can offer stability in turbulent times. Lingering inflation and disappointing corporate earnings are the biggest risks the stock market will face in 2025.

Title: Tesla's earnings report will include refocusing on its car business, and it comes as competition heats up

Good morning! Add this to the list of things that might scare you about artificial intelligence: losing your home. Real-estate scammers are using AI tools to commit deed theft, with the owner of a $137.5 million mansion saying they're among the victims. In today's big story, Tesla reports earnings this afternoon with the focus back on its cars business. What's on deck: But first, back to basics. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Tesla has spent plenty of time discussing the future, but Wall Street wants to bring the EV giant back to the present. Elon Musk's company reports third-quarter earnings this afternoon, and analysts are focused on its core auto business. Business Insider's Matthew Fox has a rundown on analysts' expectations ahead of Tesla's big day. (To get real-time updates on Tesla's earnings, be sure to check out our live blog here.) Musk has spent time talking up everything but the cars his company currently sells. From robotaxis to autonomous vehicles and bartending bots, Tesla's earnings calls have been heavily focused on what's next instead of what's now. Tesla has good reason to avoid talking about the present. Its sales dropped for two straight quarters before righting the ship in Q3. It'll now take a massive fourth quarter for its 2024 sales to eclipse last year's figure. Touting robotaxis and pitching the company as a leader in artificial intelligence has eased the pain (and helped the stock price), but even that has its limit. Tesla's share price is still down more than 12% year-to-date after its flashy robotaxi event mostly fell flat with investors. That's why all eyes are back on its core business of selling cars, including the status of its industry-leading profit margins. The report could signal the worst is behind Tesla … or is yet to come. Tesla also needs to worry about what's in its rearview mirror. General Motors' third-quarter earnings report topped estimates, leading to a nearly 10% surge in its stock. Part of its success included improved EV growth and profitability, writes BI's Benjamin Zhang. GM now holds a 9.8% share of the US market, trailing only Tesla. That comes during what's been an overall tough time for the EV market. (But a good time for any who's in the market for one!) While the industry continues to grow, it's at a much slower pace than a few years ago. Automakers have been forced to readjust their strategy around breaking into the market. Overseas, things aren't much better for Tesla. China, the world's largest auto market and an area of growth for Tesla, has gotten increasingly competitive. Domestic rivals recently posted a record month for sales, and China's EV giants stole the show at Europe's largest auto show.

Title: Nvidia's CEO says a design flaw in its new AI chip was '100% Nvidia's fault'

Nvidia (NVDA) says it has fixed a design flaw in its latest artificial intelligence chips that led to production and shipping delays. The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), to resolve the engineering setback in its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said, according to Reuters. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” The complexity of the project contributed to the setback. The Blackwell computer involved seven new chip designs that needed to be developed and put into production simultaneously, according to Huang. The problems first surfaced in August, when Nvidia’s stock fell around 8% after a report that Blackwell’s production was delayed due to a design flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). During the company’s second-quarter earnings that month, Huang said Nvidia shipped samples of Blackwell to customers and that the AI platform’s production would ramp up in the fourth quarter into the next fiscal year. To “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said during earnings. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts. The company said it expects to “ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue” in the fourth quarter. “What TSMC did, was to help us recover from that yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell at an incredible pace,” Huang said during an appearance in Denmark to unveil the country’s first AI supercomputer, Gefion. The recovery appears successful. In October, Nvidia shares got a boost after Huang said Blackwell was in full production and demand for the chip was “insane.” “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first,” Huang said during an appearance on CNBC. Nvidia stock closed at a record high of $143.71 per share earlier this week ahead of major technology companies’ earnings. The chipmaker’s shares were down 3.3% during mid-day trading on Wednesday but are up around 189% so far this year.

Title: DoubleVerify stock hits 52-week low at $16.38 amid market challenges

In a challenging market environment, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. (NYSE:DV) stock has touched a 52-week low, reaching a price level of $16.38. The company, known for its software platform that provides online media verification and campaign effectiveness solutions, has seen a significant downturn over the past year, with its stock price declining by 42.53%. This substantial drop reflects broader market trends and possibly investor concerns about the company's growth prospects amidst a competitive digital advertising landscape. The 52-week low marks a critical point for DoubleVerify as it navigates through the current economic headwinds and aims to reassure investors of its long-term value proposition. In other recent news, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. has seen adjustments to its stock price target by several firms, including Needham, Truist Securities, and Canaccord Genuity, all of which have maintained a Buy rating. The adjustments are due to revised growth expectations, notably in the company's Measurement and Activation segments. Needham now projects DoubleVerify's FY25 revenue to be $770 million, a 15% year-over-year increase, but 6% below the previous estimate. Furthermore, DoubleVerify reported a 17% increase in Q2 revenue to $156 million, along with an 83% gross margin and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA, driven by strong performance in social and Connected TV measurement and a growing supply side platform business. The company also introduced its Inflammatory Politics and News category on Meta (NASDAQ:META), aimed at protecting advertisers from aligning with controversial content. This new feature is supported by DoubleVerify's Universal Content Intelligence, an AI-powered engine that ensures precise content categorization across the platform. In addition, DoubleVerify has established new partnerships and anticipates a positive revenue impact starting early 2025 following the closure of competing services like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s Moat and Grapeshot. Analysts from both Truist Securities and Canaccord Genuity expect DoubleVerify to continue outperforming its closest peer and the overall digital advertising industry. These are recent developments for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent stock performance aligns with the InvestingPro data, which shows a 45.72% price decline over the past six months. Despite this downturn, the company maintains some financial strengths. According to InvestingPro Tips, DoubleVerify holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial position. This could provide the company with flexibility to navigate the current challenging market conditions. The company also boasts impressive gross profit margins, with InvestingPro data revealing a gross profit margin of 82.18% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This high margin suggests that DoubleVerify's software platform remains cost-effective and potentially scalable, which could be crucial for future growth. However, investors should note that the stock is trading at a high P/E ratio of 47.04, significantly above market averages. This valuation metric, combined with the recent stock price decline, may indicate that the market is recalibrating expectations for the company's growth trajectory. For those seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips on DoubleVerify, providing deeper insights into the company's financial health and market position.

Title: TSMC halts supply to customer after finding its chip in Huawei product, source says

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co has suspended shipments to a customer after it discovered that one of its chips supplied to the client ended up in a Huawei product, according to a Taiwan official familiar with the situation. About two weeks ago, TSMC suspended shipments to the client and began a detailed investigation, the trade and economic official said, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. The company has notified the U.S. and Taiwanese governments, the official said as it was an "important warning event" within TSMC, and can, at its earliest, be traced back to Oct. 11. The official did not identify the client TSMC had cut off. TSMC declined comment. A second official told Reuters that TSMC had not informed Taiwan's government of the name of the client. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TSMC had alerted U.S. officials after tech research firm TechInsights took apart a Huawei product and found one of TSMC's chips, Reuters reported on Tuesday, in a possible violation of U.S. export restrictions. The U.S. curbed the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to China two years ago, citing the need to limit the Chinese military's capabilities. Huawei has been a primary target of the U.S. government's efforts to escalate the use of export controls to keep Chinese companies from obtaining, designing or manufacturing advanced semiconductors. Still, Chinese entities have been trying to circumvent the restrictions and have used cloud services provided by companies such as Amazon to access advanced U.S. chips and AI capabilities, Reuters reported earlier this year. Taiwan's government, wary of its giant neighbour given repeated military and other threats, has its own export control to prevent advanced chips from being made in China, and Taiwan officials say they take compliance with U.S. rules seriously.

Title: YieldMax™ ETFs Announces Distributions on MSTY (175.64%), AIYY (100.45%), SQY (70.37%), YMAX (67.11%), YMAG (14.96%) and Others

October 23, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Oct. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax™ ETFs (except YMAX, YMAG and ULTY) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. ULTY has a gross expense ratio of 1.24% but the investment adviser has agreed to a 0.10% fee waiver through at least February 28, 2025. 2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October 22, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. 3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended September 30. 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. As of such date, the ULTY subsidized and unsubsidized 30-Day SEC Yields were 0.00% and 0.00%, respectively. The subsidized yield reflects fee waivers in effect while the unsubsidized yield does not adjust for any fee waivers in effect. 4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 5 As of the date hereof, distributions for the following ETFs have included return of investor capital: TSLY, OARK, APLY, AMZY, NVDY, GOOY, JPMO, XOMO, PYPY, CONY, DISO, FBY, MSFO, NFLY, SQY, AMDY, MRNY, AIYY, MSTY, ULTY, YMAX, YMAG, YBIT, SNOY, CRSH, GDXY and FIAT. For additional information, please visit www.YieldMaxETFs.com/TaxInfo. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Standardized Performance For YMAX, click here. For YMAG, click here. For TSLY, click here. For OARK, click here. For APLY, click here.

There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERNCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Nvidia's design flaw with Blackwell AI chips now fixed, CEO says

By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Supantha Mukherjee COPENHAGEN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday a design flaw with its latest Blackwell AI chips which impacted production has been fixed with the help of longtime Taiwanese manufacturing partner TSMC. Nvidia unveiled Blackwell chips in March and had earlier said they would ship in the second quarter but were delayed, potentially affecting customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's, Google and Microsoft. "We had a design flaw in Blackwell," Huang said. "It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low. It was 100% Nvidia's fault." According to media reports, the delay in production had caused tensions between Nvidia and TSMC but Huang dismissed that as "fake news". "In order to make a Blackwell computer work, seven different types of chips were designed from scratch and had to be ramped into production at the same time," he said. "What TSMC did, was to help us recover from that yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell at an incredible place." Nvidia's Blackwell chips take two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering and binds them together into a single component that is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. At a recent Goldman Sachs conference the CEO said the chips will now ship in the fourth quarter. Huang was in Denmark on Wednesday to launch a new supercomputer named Gefion, which boasts 1,528 graphic processing units (GPUs) and was built in partnership with Novo Nordisk Foundation, Denmark's Export and Investment Fund and Nvidia.

Title: Peloton is going to sell its deluxe stationary bikes at Costco to reach holiday shoppers this Christmas
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/23/peloton-sell-deluxe-stationary-bikes-costco-holiday-shoppers-christmas/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T10:09:47Z
Full Content:
Peloton plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at Costco this holiday season as the struggling connected-exercise company seeks to broaden its customer base. The Peloton Bike+, a stationary bike that enables riders to participate in online classes and work out with a virtual community of friends, will be sold at a discount online and in 300 Costco stores from November through mid-February, the companies announced Tuesday. The model will sell in Costco stores for $1,999 and will require self-assembly. That’s about $500 cheaper than buying a new bike directly through Peloton’s website, a purchase which includes delivery and setup. Costco will also sell the Peloton Bike+ on its website for $2,199, which includes delivery. “The Costco brand is incredibly powerful and respected in the U.S. and abroad,” Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton’s chief emerging business officer, said in a news release. “Costco members know they are shopping for high quality products from trusted brands with the best value.” The partnership with Costco is a way for Peloton to cast a wider net and make its products more accessible, said Angeli Gianchandani, an adjunct instructor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies. “Costco might be known for low cost, but at the same time they don’t shy away from carrying high-end products,” Gianchandani said. “And this falls in line with that strategy and how they carry their product selection to really appeal to a wider demographic that’s affluent, and they appreciate quality and value.” Once marketed as an exclusive, aspirational brand, Peloton began rebranding itself to be seen as more accessible as it grappled with falling sales and a plummeting stock price. In August 2022, the company made its exercise bikes and other gear available for purchase on Amazon in the U.S. The Peloton Bike+ is a step up from the original Peloton bike because it has a rotating touch-screen and a resistance knob that can be set to automatically adjust to an instructor’s recommendations. To participate in classes, riders purchase an all-access membership for $44 a month, which also includes classes in meditation, strength training, yoga and other disciplines. Peloton’s choice to sell at Costco “appears to be based not just on Costco’s size and formidable footprint, but the nature of the demographics that shop at the warehouse club,” said Kimberly Whitler, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Virginia. “Specifically, it appears that they are attempting to reach younger, wealthier individuals who are likely a prime demographic group.” Costco Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in September that about half of the retailers new members this year were under 40 years old. Sales of Peloton bikes soared during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when gyms closed and many people stayed home to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading the virus. The company’s share price surpassed $150 in late 2020. But the growth was unsustainable, and slowed when pandemic restrictions began to ease. Peloton also issued damaging recalls including one of about 125,000 treadmills in 2021 after they were linked to a child’s death and dozens of injuries, and another of more than 2 million bikes that had a seat post which could break during use. Facing these challenges, Peloton’s stock price began a long tumble. It has been trading below $7 a share for all of 2024. In May, Peloton cut 400 jobs and CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down. Peloton also has been selling refurbished bikes on its website, charging $1,145 for a used standard Peloton and $1,995 for a used Peloton Bike+. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational corporation and technology company that develops and markets software, services, and hardware. The company’s AI strategy is evident through its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI across Azure, Office 365, and security solutions which together create a strong ecosystem. On Monday, October 21, Microsoft had its “AI Tour” in London, announcing the rollout of its Copilot AI features designed to enhance productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. The company plans to allow businesses to create their own autonomous agents within the Copilot Studio, Microsoft’s platform for building and customizing its “Copilot” assistants, fending off challenges from Salesforce. These agents can be built in the studio with low code or no code instructions, which in turn allow users to create AI-driven workflows without needing major technical expertise. The software will be available for public preview next month. The technology company has also revealed that it will launch 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365, which is the company’s suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management apps. The company’s autonomous agents aim to achieve a return on investment in AI. As per CFO Amy Hood, the company has spent $19 billion on capital expenditures, including finance leases, a large portion of which was derived from AI and cloud-related needs. With 2.1 million users engaged with Copilot, Microsoft is banking heavily on the platform to generate revenues. As of Q4, the company achieved $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue from its cloud services, which includes its AI platform, a 21% year-over-year increase. While all these announcements may seem like a big leap for Microsoft, the company received a rare downgrade last month over concerns about the tech giant’s over-reliance on Nvidia for its AI infrastructure. On September 23, analysts at D.A. Davidson, an investment banking company, downgraded the company’s stock from “Buy” to “Neutral”, keeping their price target unchanged at $475. While the analysts are still positive about Microsoft, they note how the company lags behind its rivals in AI chip development, something its rivals started working on as early as a decade ago. “They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google. But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.” Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global technology company engineering the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future. The company is said to represent “the dominant” infrastructure player behind the current rise of the AI sector. Wall Street is abuzz with excitement about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s new AI chip, Blackwell. Sector analysts are enthusiastic about the company’s potential major upside in the fourth quarter with all the initial rush of Blackwell. On October 18, Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, discussed on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts how things are looking up for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) . According to Lumida CEO, the company is still in the “early innings” and expects that Nvidia’s stock will reach $150 between now and the end of the year. With the hyperscalers intending to each spend between $50 and $100 billion on GPU compute, the primary beneficiary is going to be NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), he says. Lumidia's CEO further commented how the company has a class of its own and doesn’t have a “close competitor”. There is a growing confidence that the chip giant will be the first Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation. "We made a call earlier this year that Nvidia would be the most valuable company in the world. It achieved that milestone yesterday, and the demand for GPU chips is strong. And you're seeing enterprises start to get some ROI (return on investment) on it from the early adopters”. On Friday, October 18, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his “Buy” rating on the stock, raising his price target by $25 to $190. From Taiwan Semiconductor's (one of Nvidia’s major suppliers) third-quarter results to the “insane” demand for Blackwell chips as quoted by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the analyst believes that recent industry trends have the potential to increase the company’s lead and generational opportunity. Furthermore, “underappreciated” enterprise partnerships with companies are also catalysts for more growth. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice (more on pg. 10)”. According to the bank’s forecast, the AI technology market will grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $117 billion this year while Nvidia maintains a 75% market share, which translated to a staggering $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. Arya also believes the company could see at least $200 billion in free cash flow generation over the next two years. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer Weigh In (Update)

Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 81 billionaires supporting Harris and 52 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: Ellison and Griffin are perhaps the most surprising billionaires who have stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering both have donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Griffin (Citadel) confirmed Thursday he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), while Griffin, the 39th-wealthiest, had been a Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) supporter. A total of 81 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: (Updated Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. A total of 52 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: (Updated Oct. 16) The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings. He gave another $43.6 million to a pro-Trump committee from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, becoming the second-most prolific donor in Trump’s camp this year, trailing only Adelson. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. (Updated Oct. 22): The New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. Tangent A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). has reintroduced its facial recognition technology to combat fraudulent advertisements, a move that comes after a three-year hiatus. The technology will be used in a trial involving approximately 50,000 public figures, comparing their Facebook profile photos against images in suspected scam ads. The company has also released new artificial intelligence (AI) models, including a "Self-Taught Evaluator," which aims to reduce human involvement in the AI development process. In addition, a Massachusetts judge has denied Meta's bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the company of designing features on its Instagram platform to addict young users. Meanwhile, financial firms TD Cowen and Mizuho Securities have raised their price targets on Meta's stock, citing potential revenue growth and market performance.

Meta's market capitalization stands at an impressive $1.47 trillion, reflecting its dominant position in the social media landscape.

These factors indicate Meta's solid financial footing, which may provide reassurance to investors despite insider selling activity.

BofA Securities analyst Justin Post maintained a Buy rating on Meta Platforms Inc META with a price target of $630. Meta’s third-quarter earnings will likely exceed expectations with revenue of $40.4 billion and EPS of $5.35, slightly above Street estimates of $40.2 billion and $5.19, respectively, as per Post. The growth is driven by several factors, including new AI tools and CRM integration, which are boosting return on investment (ROI) and increasing ad spend. Also Read: Meta’s Smart Glasses Dominate Ray-Ban Stores, AI Features Still Missing Messaging and Reel monetization are ramping up, and a modest 100-200 bps benefit from political ad spending is expected. Post noted that Meta could lower the upper end of its 2024 expense guide by $1 billion, from $98.2 billion to $96 billion—$98 billion, thanks to layoffs and a reduction in job openings. Capex, however, could trend toward the higher end of guidance, between $37 billion—$40 billion, as Meta continues to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, as per the analyst. The fourth-quarter revenue guidance will likely range between $45 billion—$47.5 billion, with ad revenue growth decelerating by 2 points to 16% year-over-year, he noted However, as per Post, growing AI benefits for ad targeting, more robust Reels usage, and incremental political ad spending could offer marginal upside. He said Meta remains well-positioned in AI, with analysts forecasting multi-year growth opportunities, particularly through generative AI and infrastructure developments. Despite potential near-term volatility due to high expectations, Meta’s stock has risen 63% year-to-date, maintaining its status as a top AI pick. Price Action: META stock is up 1.23% at $582.21 at last check Tuesday. Also Read: Image via Shutterstock © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

Title: Peloton plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at Costco to reach holiday shoppers

Peloton plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at Costco this holiday season as the struggling connected-exercise company seeks to broaden its customer base NEW YORK -- Peloton plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at Costco this holiday season as the struggling connected-exercise company seeks to broaden its customer base. The Peloton Bike+, a stationary bike that enables riders to participate in online classes and work out with a virtual community of friends, will be sold at a discount online and in 300 Costco stores from November through mid-February, the companies announced Tuesday. The model will sell in Costco stores for $1,999 and will require self-assembly. That's about $500 cheaper than buying a new bike directly through Peloton's website, a purchase which includes delivery and setup. Costco will also sell the Peloton Bike+ on its website for $2,199, which includes delivery. “The Costco brand is incredibly powerful and respected in the U.S. and abroad," Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton's chief emerging business officer, said in a news release. “Costco members know they are shopping for high quality products from trusted brands with the best value.” The partnership with Costco is a way for Peloton to cast a wider net and make its products more accessible, said Angeli Gianchandani, an adjunct instructor at New York University's School of Professional Studies. “Costco might be known for low cost, but at the same time they don’t shy away from carrying high-end products,” Gianchandani said. “And this falls in line with that strategy and how they carry their product selection to really appeal to a wider demographic that’s affluent, and they appreciate quality and value.” Once marketed as an exclusive, aspirational brand, Peloton began rebranding itself to be seen as more accessible as it grappled with falling sales and a plummeting stock price. In August 2022, the company made its exercise bikes and other gear available for purchase on Amazon in the U.S. The Peloton Bike+ is a step up from the original Peloton bike because it has a rotating touch-screen and a resistance knob that can be set to automatically adjust to an instructor’s recommendations. To participate in classes, riders purchase an all-access membership for $44 a month, which also includes classes in meditation, strength training, yoga and other disciplines. Peloton’s choice to sell at Costco “appears to be based not just on Costco’s size and formidable footprint, but the nature of the demographics that shop at the warehouse club,” said Kimberly Whitler, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Virginia. “Specifically, it appears that they are attempting to reach younger, wealthier individuals who are likely a prime demographic group.” Costco Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in September that about half of the retailers new members this year were under 40 years old. Sales of Peloton bikes soared during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when gyms closed and many people stayed home to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading the virus. The company's share price surpassed $150 in late 2020. But the growth was unsustainable, and slowed when pandemic restrictions began to ease. Peloton also issued damaging recalls including one of about 125,000 treadmills in 2021 after they were linked to a child’s death and dozens of injuries, and another of more than 2 million bikes that had a seat post which could break during use. Facing these challenges, Peloton's stock price began a long tumble. It has been trading below $7 a share for all of 2024. In May, Peloton cut 400 jobs and CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down. Peloton also has been selling refurbished bikes on its website, charging $1,145 for a used standard Peloton and $1,995 for a used Peloton Bike+. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Amazon to shut down speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/amazon-shut-speedy-brick-mortar-delivery-service-rcna176685
Time Published: 2024-10-22T21:31:34Z

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Amazon is shutting down a service that offers same-day delivery from mall and brick-and-mortar retailers, CNBC has learned. The company has stopped any new development of the service, called Amazon Today, and will begin to wind it down, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The bulk of the program will be shut down by Dec. 2, the people said. Select retail partners will be able to continue fulfilling orders with Amazon Today through Jan. 24, 2025, Amazon told CNBC. A small amount of employees will be laid off and provided with severance, while others will be transitioned to other positions within Amazon, the company said. Employees who work on Amazon Today learned the news in a meeting on Monday, where some staffers were informed they would be laid off, the people said. Roughly 300 employees were working on Amazon Today, the people said. The closure of Amazon Today is the latest example of the company’s broader cost-cutting efforts. Since 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a campaign to cut costs across the company in order to meet rapidly changing macro conditions. Beginning in 2022 and extending through 2024, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Jassy has taken a harder line on the company’s unproven, costlier bets than his predecessor, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Jassy has axed several projects, including a telehealth service, video-calling device for kids and a roving Treasure Truck. Launched in 2022, Amazon Today allows retailers who sell on Amazon to offer speedy delivery from their brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in select cities. Amazon’s contracted Flex drivers, which make deliveries using their own vehicles, fetch the packages and drop them at customers’ doorsteps within hours of when the orders were placed. Amazon Today was part of the company’s push to get online purchases to shoppers’ doorsteps at faster speeds. Amazon continues to add more facilities focused on same-day deliveries in a bid to boost sales and compete with other companies that provide ultrafast delivery. That includes Instacart and DoorDash, which have expanded beyond food and groceries and into retail. The company had signed up several retailers to Amazon Today, according to the program’s website. That list included Office Depot; Staples; Petco; PacSun; vitamin and dietary supplement chain GNC; and Fabletics, the athletic-wear brand owned by actress Kate Hudson. Amazon is working with the retailers it signed up for the service to ensure a smooth transition for them, the company said. Amazon added that it continues to prioritize and invest in fast delivery. The decision to shutter Amazon Today comes as a surprise since Amazon was in the process of onboarding other retailers, one of the people said. The company was also pitching the service to more retailers at a conference last week. The service skewed more costly than traditional delivery routes where Flex drivers can fill their cars up with packages from an Amazon warehouse, one of the people said. Amazon Today routes, which the company calls “retail deliveries,” did not usually fill up a driver’s trunk, making the program less worthwhile for the Flex contractors.

As a member of Congress, Nancy Pelosi has to disclose the trades made by herself and her husband. In a Dec. 23, 2023 disclosure, the former Speaker of the House reported a purchase made before the Christmas holiday. The purchase was made on Nov. 22, 2023, for 50 call options in Nvidia, with a $120 strike price and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024. The disclosure listed the purchase price range of $1 million to $5 million. Unusual Whales pinned the purchase to a price of $1.8 million. Nvidia shares traded between $476.90 and $503.35 on Nov. 22, 2023, when the purchase was made. The call options would have been purchased for around $360 each. Fast forward to today and the options have changed after Nvidia conducted a 10-for-1 split in June 2024. The options contracts owned by the Pelosis are now 500 call options with a $12 strike price and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024. Trending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. On Monday, these $12 call options traded at $132.05, valuing the Pelosis' position at $6,602,500. Based on the estimated cost basis of $1.8 million, the Pelosis are now up $4.8 million on this trade from last November. The options trade isn't the only one the Pelosis made over the last year. The former House Speaker also disclosed buying 10,000 NVDA shares on June 26, valued at $1 million to $5 million, and 10,000 NVDA shares on July 26, valued at $1 million to $5 million. Here's a look at those two purchases based on the intraday highs for Nvidia stock. June 26: 10,000 shares, $128.12 per share, purchase price $1,281,200, now worth $1,437,100 July 26: 10,000 shares, $116.20 per share, purchase price $1,162,000, now worth $1,437,100 The two purchases are now worth $2.87 million and up at least $430,000, depending on the timing of the purchases. Did You Know? Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Missed Profits?: While the Pelosis are now up over $5 million from their purchases of Nvidia stock and options over the last year, they could have been sitting on more profits if they hadn't sold shares back in July 2022. The sale happened after a disclosure of buying Nvidia shares ahead of the CHIPS Act, set to benefit semiconductor stocks, drew scrutiny and increased attention. In a filing, Pelosi reported selling 25,000 Nvidia shares at an average price point of $165.05. The total sale was valued at $4,126,250. The filing shows that the transaction was at a loss of $341,365. The 25,000 shares would now be 250,000 shares based on the stock split from earlier this year. Based on a price of $143.71 for Nvidia shares on Tuesday, the 250,000 shares would be worth $35,927,500. This means the Pelosis missed out on potential profits of $31,801,250 from their sale in July 2022. Nancy Pelosi says she does not share information on congressional activities with her husband. Observers remain skeptical, given the questionable timing of her disclosed trades. Pelosi’s annual salary falls between $174,000 and $197,000 as a senior member of Congress. When she served as Speaker of the House, her annual salary was $223,500. An ETF to track the stock trading activity of Democrats in Congress, the Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF (BATS:NANC), bears the Representative’s name in the stock ticker. Increased calls to ban Congress members and their spouses from trading have also centered on Pelosi, a Democrat. One bill even uses her name as an acronym: the PELOSI Act.NVDA Price Action: Nvidia shares closed at $143.71 on Monday, hitting new all-time highs. Nvidia stock is up 198% year-to-date in 2024.

Title: Gold Just Hit Its Highest Price Ever. It Might Not Stop.
URL: https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/gold-prices-record-breaking-investing-stock-market-crypto.html
Time Published: 2024-10-22T20:56:41Z

Don’t look now, but gold is back—in a big, big way. On Friday, the price of gold hit a record high, with U.S. gold futures reaching more than $2,700 an ounce and sticking around that threshold. And it’s finding newfound appeal among everyday American investors who’ve never turned to the stuff before. Gold is the big recommendation in bullish investor reports from Citibank, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase (the latter of which formerly had to pay nearly a billion dollars to the government for manipulating the precious metals markets). It’s plated over the highly overpriced Trump campaign watches and present in various other pieces of merch. It’s the hot new fashion statement for white guys, with gold chains draped around the necks of celebrities like Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Theroux. It was at the Republican National Convention. Its biggest advocates are going on tour with Tucker Carlson. It’s on the shelves of Costco, which, earlier this year, was reportedly selling up to $200 million worth of gold bars every month—and is now rapidly running out of the stuff. The precious metal is even a part of a revived business strategy for luxury watch brands, whose yellow-gold timepieces were the accessory of choice for Ryan Gosling in Barbie. Gold also frequently appears on the ads that sponsor the podcasts hosted by far-right conspiracists Charlie Kirk, Matt Walsh, and Candace Owens—and, yes, it’s also on Fox News and Newsmax. Beyond that, you can find even more on Rumble and on Truth Social, which will sell you everything from “free” gold bars to collectible gold coins featuring Trump’s mug shot to “info kits” on investing. There’s gold in Sen. Bob Menendez’s basement, and Sam Altman’s as well. No wonder we’re still mining for it under the hills of South Dakota. Gold has always been an American status symbol and object of fascination for doomsday preppers, evangelical end-timers, and right-wing commentators like Glenn Beck; it’s easy bait for older retirees, anxious about the savings they’ve built up throughout their life and alienated by the changing world around them, and it’s always been a sensible advertising choice for the types of radio stations and TV networks they tune in to. But this moment of peak hype is particularly notable, since we’re not in a typical climate for such a massive, extended precious metals surge. Gold and silver purchases (and their prices) usually shoot up during economic conditions that aren’t quite like the current one: eras of poor GDP outlooks, low interest rates, a weak U.S. dollar, and skittish investors and consumers. Still, keeping in line with the much-scrutinized economic weirdness of the past half-decade, gold has stayed lofty even as the economy booms, interest rates mostly remain high, consumer sentiment improves dramatically, and the dollar’s muscular value prevails. Usually, the price of gold is as reliable an indicator of economic orthodoxy as any other. But now it appears to be the outlier. And, irony of ironies, bitcoin has gone from stand-alone “digital gold” status and financial hedge to acting as just another commodity that swings with stock-market trends. As the Wall Street Journal explained earlier this year, a curious trend gripped the goldbug universe in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic. Before then, most of the gold-curious got their hands on physical manifestations of the metal (jewelry, doubloons, etc.) but also expressed healthy interest in gold-backed exchange-traded funds, an easier and more virtual way of placing your monetary confidence in the metal. But in 2020, demand for both physical gold and ETFs reached an equivalent level—then diverged sharply in the years after, with physical gold reaching new heights and ETFs plunging squarely into the negative. Meaning: A lot of goldbugs lost their faith in the market model for gold trading and decided to ditch it in favor of the actual stuff. Understandable, considering how the apocalyptic vibes of the prevaccination era and the systemic effects of the shutdowns spurred more everyday consumers to keep gold as a safe backup and to hold on as things began to recover in jittery fashion. (Only recently did gold ETFs regain some of that lost demand.) Another significant trend of the 2021 recovery: Central banks began racking up gold bullion in droves as a hedge against the U.S. dollar, whose home government dithered on raising interest rates even as inflation started becoming an issue. The ensuing “de-dollarization” panic among emerging economies, heightened by the massive global impacts of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, made gold seem even more attractive for international reserves. The global economy was improving, sure, but also: Everything was chaotic, countries around the world saw their currencies lose their worth due to inflation, the United States and its dollar no longer seemed as sturdy as they once did, and wars were breaking out. Why wouldn’t nations like China, Singapore, India, Zimbabwe, Poland, and Turkey set aside some gold for themselves, as a treat? Financial analysts are effusively claiming that we’re hardly at the peak of the gold rally and could see even more records in the near future, as geopolitical nerves and distrust in institutions buoy mass interest in the metal. And when gold demand and prices go up on such a far-reaching scale, the ripple effects are unavoidable. Controversial, exploitative mines across West Africa open, or reopen, for business. Far-right propaganda outfits like the Epoch Times (notably run by Chinese expats) often include gold ads in their influence operations. Traders put off by the strange nature of this economic moment espouse gold’s stability on financial TV, just a few channels’ flip away from all the other right-wing outlets propped up by gold sponsors—which then point to messy current events to keep aged retirees scared and wondering whether anything is safe and stable anymore. Forget the meme stocks. Gold is forever. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company. All contents © 2024 The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved.

The company has stopped any new development of the service, called Amazon Today, and will begin to wind it down, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The bulk of the program will be shut down by Dec. 2, the people said. Select retail partners will be able to continue fulfilling orders with Amazon Today through Jan. 24, 2025, Amazon told CNBC. A small amount of employees will be laid off and provided with severance, while others will be transitioned to other positions within Amazon, the company said. Employees who work on Amazon Today learned the news in a meeting on Monday, where some staffers were informed they would be laid off, the people said. Roughly 300 employees were working on Amazon Today, the people said. Amazon disputed the figure, saying there were approximately 175 employees in the unit. The closure of Amazon Today is the latest example of the company's broader cost-cutting efforts. Since 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a campaign to cut costs across the company in order to meet rapidly changing macro conditions. Beginning in 2022 and extending through 2024, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Jassy has taken a harder line on the company's unproven, costlier bets than his predecessor, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Jassy has axed several projects, including a telehealth service, video-calling device for kids and a roving Treasure Truck. Launched in 2022, Amazon Today allows retailers who sell on Amazon to offer speedy delivery from their brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in select cities. Amazon's contracted Flex drivers, which make deliveries using their own vehicles, fetch the packages and drop them at customers' doorsteps within hours of when the orders were placed. Amazon Today was part of the company's push to get online purchases to shoppers' doorsteps at faster speeds. Amazon continues to add more facilities focused on same-day deliveries in a bid to boost sales and compete with other companies that provide ultrafast delivery. That includes Instacart and DoorDash, which have expanded beyond food and groceries and into retail. The company had signed up several retailers to Amazon Today, according to the program's website. That list included Office Depot; Staples; Petco; PacSun; vitamin and dietary supplement chain GNC; and Fabletics, the athletic-wear brand owned by actress Kate Hudson. Amazon is working with the retailers it signed up for the service to ensure a smooth transition for them, the company said. Amazon added that it continues to prioritize and invest in fast delivery. The decision to shutter Amazon Today comes as a surprise since Amazon was in the process of onboarding other retailers, one of the people said. The company was also pitching the service to more retailers at a conference last week. The service skewed more costly than traditional delivery routes where Flex drivers can fill their cars up with packages from an Amazon warehouse, one of the people said. Amazon Today routes, which the company calls "retail deliveries," did not usually fill up a driver's trunk, making the program less worthwhile for the Flex contractors.

Title: Amazon Earnings: Is The Stock A Buy Before Or After Reporting?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/amazon-amzn-stock-earnings-is-it-buy-before-after-earnings/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T19:15:30Z

Amazon's earnings should be out at the end of the month. Amazon (AMZN) stock is currently about 6% shy of its 52-week intra-day peak of $201.20 reached on July 8. Following a second-quarter revenue miss and less-than-rosy guidance for the third quarter, the stock closed at a low of $161.02 on August 5, but has staged a comeback ever since, closing Monday’s trade at $189.07. Although the strength in its cloud business–Amazon Web Services (AWS)–continues to cast a halo on the rest of its services, experts opine that Amazon may be ceding market share to Microsoft’s fast-growing cloud platform, Azure. The ballooning costs for Amazon’s ambitious Kuiper satellite internet project triggered an analyst downgrade on fears that it could slow down the pace of margin expansion. With third-quarter earnings slated for release on October 31, should investors buy into Amazon stock now, or wait to see how the earnings pan out? What are the metrics investors should look for in Amazon’s upcoming earnings print? What is the long-term outlook for Amazon stock? Amazon has outperformed earnings estimates over the last four quarters by a wide range of 18% to 59%. The highest beat was in the third quarter of last year. Sources: Company Press Releases, Seeking Alpha Amazon had a revenue miss in the most recent second quarter, following revenue beats in the previous three quarters. A beat by $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 marked the best revenue outperformance.

Amazon is scheduled to release its third quarter results on October 31. Analysts expect Amazon to report EPS of $1.14 on revenues of $157.2 billion, representing increases of 21.3% and 9.9%, respectively, from year-ago numbers. Amazon guided third-quarter net sales to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, representing 8% to 11% growth from year-ago numbers of $143.1 billion. Since, the midpoint of this range was below the consensus estimate, the stock sank to a low of $161.02 on August 5. Although the stock has staged a nice recovery since then, it is yet to revisit its July 8 intraday high of $201.20. Amazon sees third-quarter operating income of $11.5 billion to $15 billion vs. year-ago $11.2 billion. In the third quarter of 2023, Amazon beat its own guidance, outperformed EPS estimates by a whopping 59% and revenue estimates by $1.6 billion, but the mid-point of its fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $160 billion to $167 billion fell below the consensus of $166.6 billion. Yet, the stock rallied 35% from its October 26, 2023 (third-quarter earnings release date) closing price of $119.57 to end trade at $161.26 on Jan 29, 2024 (just ahead of Amazon’s fourth-quarter earnings announcement on February 1). Amazon’s third-quarter results typically benefit from the Amazon Prime Day, a 48-hour shopping event held usually in July with excellent deals for shoppers seeking good bargains. Amazon’s upcoming third-quarter earnings print will include sales from the Prime Day 2024, which the online retail giant called “its biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales” but did not quantify. However, competition is catching up with Amazon’s revenue drive. The Prime Day has spurred other retailers to jump in with their promotions. Adobe Analytics estimates that online shoppers spent an estimated $14.2 billion across U.S. retailers in the July two-day period this year, up 11% from last year’s $12.7 billion. Amazon beat its own revenue guidance and analysts’ revenue estimates in three out of the last four quarters. A third-quarter earnings beat is likely in the cards, given Amazon’s EPS beats for four quarters in a row and just one miss over the past eight quarters. However, past performance holds no guarantees for the future. According to data from Synergy Research Group, which tracks IT and cloud data, Amazon remained the market leader among cloud providers during the June-2024 quarter with a 32% market share, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 12%. Comparing this to December quarter numbers of 2020, AWS had a 31% market share vs. Azure’s 20% and Google Cloud’s 7%. Azure and Google Cloud have grown market share at a quicker pace since 2020, but not at the cost of AWS. It is also encouraging to see that second-quarter 2024 enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services rose 22% year over year to $79 billion worldwide, marking the third consecutive quarter of year over year growth of 20% or more, thanks to generative AI. As for revenues, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud group, which includes Azure revenue, reported $28.5 billion in revenue for the June quarter, up 19% year over year, while operating income for the segment rose to $12.9 billion, from $10.5 billion in the year-ago period. Amazon reported AWS sales of $26.3 billion, up 19% year over year. AWS operating income was $9.3 billion vs. year-ago $5.4 billion. Google Cloud reported sales of $10.3 billion up 29% from the year-ago period. Operating income for Google Cloud rose to $1.2 billion from $395 million last year. The catch here is Microsoft does not break out Azure dollar figures separately. So, it’s a bit complicated to understand Azure consumption. However, Microsoft has updated its reporting structure, under which the new Azure number is expected to now align more closely to its consumption business. This could pave the way for a better comparison process with AWS. Amazon stock is a bullish bet for the long term and here are factors that are expected to stimulate growth forward. Profitability has always been a sticky point with Amazon. The focus has been on growth vs. profits. Operating margins have never touched double digits until the first quarter of 2024, prior to which the best number was 8.2% for the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2024, operating margin rose to 10.7% from 7.8% in the fourth quarter, thanks to CEO Andy Jassy’s cost-cutting initiatives and stronger performance of higher-margin businesses like advertising and cloud computing. In the second quarter of 2024, operating margin was 9.9%. For the third quarter, operating margin is expected to be between 7.3% and 9.5% based on operating income guidance of $11.5 billion to $15 billion, on net sales of $154 billion to $158.5 billion. The resurgence in digital advertising amid the beginning of the Fed rate easing cycle and inflation moderating close to the Fed’s targets, should continue to power Amazon’s advertising revenues. Brands cut back on advertising spend in 2022, after inflation reached the highest levels in four decades and the Fed began to hike rates as an inflation reduction measure. Amazon’s ad revenues have grown more than 20% year over year during the last six quarters. For the first and second quarters of 2024, ad revenue increased 24% to $11.8 billion and 20% to $12.8 billion, respectively, year over year. In its June earnings call, Amazon said that it added more than $2 billion in advertising revenue year over year and generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. The online ad business is small compared to Amazon’s online retail business, but growing at a solid pace, and will remain a key contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. Amazon competes against Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet, which continue to dominate the digital ad space. Meta’s second-quarter sales, the bulk of which is generated from advertising, rose 22% year over year to $39.1 billion, while Google reported second-quarter ad sales of $64.6 billion, up 11% from the year ago period. Ad sales in the YouTube division rose 13% to $8.7 billion. Events like the Paris Olympics and elections in the U.S have fueled ad spending in 2024. Sponsored ads drive the majority of Amazon’s advertising revenue, while an expansion into Prime Video ads earlier this year will set the stage for future growth. Amazon is leveraging AI to improve the relevance of ads and in improving measures that allow brands to see the returns on their ad spend. Going forward, advertising on Prime Video will be an integral part of the digital ad business model, as it gives large advertisers a platform to pitch a product or service before a huge and growing audience. Amazon Prime Video viewership in September rose 12%—recording the strongest monthly growth in September among streaming platforms–thanks to Thursday Night Football and The Rings of Power, according to Nielsen, which specializes in audience measurement, data and analytics. However, Amazon will keep the ad loads lighter on Prime relative to linear TV and other streaming TV providers, as well as provide an ad-free streaming option for subscribers for an additional $2.99 per month. In 2025, Amazon plans to roll out Prime Video ads in Brazil, India, Japan, the Netherlands and New Zealand complementing its current presence in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Spain. Amazon is positioning AWS to serve the strong demand across both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads, as businesses migrate from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud amid robust enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services. AWS is at an annualized revenue run rate of more than $105 billion with second quarter revenue of $26.3 billion growing 18.8% year over year, accelerating from the 17.2% year over year growth in the first quarter, and 13% year over year growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. Thanks to Amazon’s cost discipline, AWS reported an operating margin of 35.5% for the June quarter vs. year-ago 24.2%. The AWS backlog was a whopping $156.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up about 19% y-o-y. So, it is not surprising that Amazon’s capital investments for the second half of 2024, will be higher than the $30.5 billion it spent in the first half, and a bulk of that spending will be directed towards AWS infrastructure. Project Kuiper is Amazon’s ambitious initiative to establish a satellite internet network to provide high-speed internet to underserved and unserved regions globally, by launching 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit. A new report from Space industry consultancy Quilty Space, says the costs for Project Kuiper may be spiraling way beyond Amazon’s estimate of $10 billion to a staggering $16.5 billion to $20 billion. While this may not seem particularly concerning in view of Amazon’s trailing 12-month free cash flow of $51.4 billion (adjusted for equipment finance leases), which has surged by 664% year-over-year–it remains a noteworthy figure. A more pressing challenge for Amazon is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license, which stipulates that at least half of the satellites need to be deployed by mid-2026. To comply with the FCC’s 2026 deadline, Amazon and its partners must push launch rates to unprecedented levels within the realm of private space operations. Quilty believes that the reliance of Amazon on all-new launch vehicles may also be an impediment to the launch, and Amazon may have to likely seek an extended timeline from the FCC. Even before Project Kuiper can get off the ground, it already has competition from Starlink, which has over 6,000 satellites in orbit. Starlink is a subsidiary of Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Despite SpaceX’s head-start advantage, there’s no stopping Amazon from making a market for itself. For one, AWS supports a third of the globe’s internet infrastructure, benefiting Kuiper with a pre-existing customer base unlike Starlink that had to build its subscriber base from ground up. Amazon launched its first two prototype satellites on October 6, 2023, and reported achieving 100% success. Amazon will begin deploying its satellite constellation in early 2025 and rolling out the commercial service later in the year. In its second-quarter earnings call, Amazon said that overall North America segment operating margin decreased slightly due to increased second-quarter spend in some investment areas, including Kuiper, kicking off a debate among analysts on Kuiper’s impact on operating margins. The concerns may appear slightly exaggerated because the North America segment operating margin for the second quarter was 5.6%, up 170 basis points year over year and down 20 basis points quarter over quarter. But the concerns are justified, as analysts estimate Kuiper spending to generate losses of up to $1 billion in the December quarter, up from $600 million in the second quarter. The losses could balloon to an estimated $5 billion to $6 billion next year, before the service starts to generate any meaningful revenue. However, Amazon declined to quantify the incremental investment for Kuiper in the second quarter earnings call. Investors can watch if it provides some color in the third-quarter earnings call. Quilty estimates that Kuiper can help Amazon generate $36 billion in annual revenues, if it can reach 100 million subscriptions at an average monthly ARPU [average revenue per user] of $30. The estimate appears quite conservative compared to the $4.2 billion in sales generated by Starlink's 2.3 million paying users in 2023, implying about $1,826 in ARPU. Amazon has secured partnerships with prominent telecom providers such as Verizon, Vodafone, and NTT, setting up Kuiper to deliver connectivity services for airplanes, ships, and other mobile platforms. According to the Quilty report, beyond Kuiper’s role as an internet service provider, If it can be positioned additionally as an alternative to Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and customized to deliver positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services, it could significantly enhance Kuiper’s value for military and commercial applications.

Amazon said its AI business is growing dramatically with a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate, although it is still in the early stages of growth. Where the tech leader has lagged in AI innovation, it is compensating by growing its own customized silicon - a grassroots technology that powers AI. Amazon’s homegrown AI chips Trainium for training AI models is witnessing significant demand, because it is more cost-effective than Nvidia’s chips and touted to deliver competitive performance. Amazon is not the new kid on the block when it comes to chipmaking. For years, it has been making Graviton chips for general purpose computing tasks. Amazon says its latest Graviton4 outperforms other x86 processors at 20% lower price points, while customers enjoy 40% to 50% price performance gains, use less electricity and improve carbon footprint. It was five years ago that AWS began to focus on developing AI processors, amid tight supply because there was primarily a single provider (implying Nvidia), and customer expectations for better price performance. Amazon built its own chip Trainium for training deep learning models, and Inferentia, its inference chip. In a recent development, startup Databricks plans to use Amazon’s Trainium AI chips in a service designed to help companies customize or create their own AI models, under a five-year deal between the two companies. This could cut costs for businesses seeking to build their own AI capabilities, because Amazon’s AI chips are cheaper. Amazon touts that its AI chips cost 40% lesser vs. other hardware offerings. Startup NinjaTech AI, which builds AI agents, uses Amazon’s Trainium processors. NinjaTech AI says it serves more than a million users a month at a cloud-services bill of about $250,000.month vs. the $750,000 to $1.2 million that would have been the cost had it deployed Nvidia’s GPUs. But Amazon has made it clear it will continue its partnerships with Nvidia, Intel and AMD, alongside offering its own processors for some differentiated capabilities, acknowledging that not all workloads will work better on its own processors. AWS plans to launch the next version of its Trainium processors by the end of this year. Amazon remains the largest online retailer in the U.S. and still generates a bulk of its revenues from its legacy retail business, which has come under pressure because of the exploding growth and popularity of Chinese shopping apps like Temu and Shein. Temu is an online marketplace operated by Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, while Shein is part of AliExpress, a China-based online retail service. Both Temu and Shein typically deliver products directly from manufacturers to American customers, at ultra-low price points, undercutting competition. Their growth is attributed mainly to a trading loophole called the 'de minimis' rule that exempts packages valued under $800 from custom duties and taxes. The rule has opened the floodgates for low-value deliveries, catapulting the volume of de minimis shipments to over a billion in 2023, from approximately 140 million in 2013, based on White House estimates. Each package has a value well below $800, making it eligible for the de minimis exemption. In June 2023, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party released a report that noted that Temu and Shein alone are likely responsible for more than 30% of all packages shipped to the United States daily under the de minimis provision, and likely for nearly half of all de minimis shipments to the U.S. from China. The U.S. has proposed fresh regulations to address the misuse of the 'de minimis' rule and to eliminate the special customs exemption for the low-value Chinese shipments that currently face tariffs from the U.S. This includes 70% of textile and apparel imports from China, and other products like shoes, machinery, etc. potentially leading to a drastic reduction in the number of de minimis shipments. The proposal is yet to be finalized. Reports say that the EU is also exploring similar measures against low-value shipments. Amazon is reportedly considering its own direct-to-consumer business taking advantage of the de minimis rule, to sell items below $20. The prime day sale in July and the upcoming holiday-shopping season are also key near-term and perennial catalysts for Amazon’s retail business. Outlook for the fourth quarter will be a key metric to watch. In its earnings announcement, Amazon typically provides net sales and operating income guidance for the sequential quarter. The difference between buying a stock before it reports earnings and after is the distinction between a speculative investment decision and an informed one. Typically, stocks may experience wild stock swings around earnings announcements. The earnings of similar or related companies may also have a spillover impact on the stock price. Market mood plays a key role, as well. Market’s reaction to Amazon’s past earnings announcements may provide some clues. Sources: Yahoo Finance, Google AMZN stock lost nearly 9% of its value after it reported second-quarter earnings on August 1, 2024. So, a position after the earnings announcement would have been beneficial vs. a pre-earnings position. AMZN stock gained nearly 8% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of fiscal 2023. Even if investors missed the opportunity to invest in the AMZN stock before the earnings announcement, the stock rallied another 10% in the post-earnings period and offered further buying opportunities. While not ideal, reduced gains are better than losses. No stock has a straight upward trajectory. It always provides several buy points along the way. So, buying after earnings reduces downside risk, while still providing gains, whereas pre-earnings purchase carries higher risk/reward. Any investing decision should be made after careful research and due diligence of the security in question, based on the risk appetite of the investors. Typically, if the stock rallies strongly ahead of earnings, it implies overwhelming optimism on the earnings outcome. This may also lead to overpricing of the stock. There is a strong likelihood that such stocks could reverse after the earnings announcement, unless the future guidance is extremely positive (in which case the momentum may likely continue). On the other hand, if a stock underperforms as it heads into earnings, it may imply muted earnings expectations or existing investors exiting or reducing positions ahead of earnings to avoid downside risks. In such a case, when the earnings announcement is positive, or not as negative as expected, shares tend to rally. Ahead of Amazon’s third-quarter earnings readout, Wedbush analysts believe that investors should take advantage of the Amazon stock’s relative underperformance, given Amazon’s accelerating AWS growth and the momentum of its high-margin advertising business that render the risk-reward attractive. On October 8, Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) bought 76,505 shares of Amazon worth around $14 million. AMZN stock is up 3.4% since then. ARKK has $5.5 billion in assets, and its five-year return of 12% is modest, at best vs. S&P 500’s 95% return in the same period. No analysts have a “sell” rating on AMZN stock, in fact 94% of analysts covering the stock are bullish about its prospects. An average price target of $219 represents nearly 16% upside from Monday’s close of $189.07. Less than 1% of the outstanding shares of AMZN is short, implying that investor sentiment is not negative. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan expects Amazon’s third quarter earnings report to reflect relatively stable eCommerce demand, and strong performance in advertising, driven by the expansion of initiatives such as video, connected TV, and international markets, and solid U.S. eComm advertising growth. Sheridan expects continued acceleration for AWS, as previous headwinds such as the impact of cloud optimization.ease. The analyst reiterates a Buy rating and $230 price target on AMZN stock. Wedbush analysts reiterated an Outperform rating and $225 price target for the stock. Wedbush expects Amazon’s operating income to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years, mainly due to its transition to higher-margin advertising, as well as AWS revenue. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Ken Gawrelski has downgraded AMZN stock from overweight to equal weight, trimming the price target from $225 to $183—one of Wall Street's most conservative projections. While AWS continues to thrive, it falls short of generating positive estimate revisions in the near future. Additional headwinds, including investments in Project Kuiper, rising pressures from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and moderating advertising contributions, are poised to cast a shadow on Amazon's earnings growth, according to the analyst. Analyzing Amazon's investment potential, particularly in the context of earnings announcements, leads to the conclusion that buying AMZN stock post-earnings may be a better approach. This way, investors can potentially mitigate downside risk and capitalize on asymmetric reward opportunities, benefiting from the latest financial disclosures and operational insights. Amazon Prime Day and Holiday shopping season are near-term catalysts for the retail business, while the proposal to regulate de minimis shipments may offer an enduring advantage against discount rivals. Amazon’s AI growth may likely stem from its home-grown AI chips that may attract businesses seeking improved price-performance options. Accelerating revenue growth, and a strong backlog, amid increased enterprise spending on infrastructure modernization will act as tailwinds for AWS. Despite all the concerns about Kuiper investment costs, the satellite-internet segment presents compelling economics for long-term growth, especially for Amazon with its pre-existing customer base. The impending rollout of Prime Video ads across additional markets, combined with a rise in viewership, is likely to bolster the high-margin online advertising business, and somewhat alleviate overall profitability growth concerns.

Title: Amazon Earnings: Is The Stock A Buy Before Or After Reporting?

Amazon's earnings should be out at the end of the month. Amazon (AMZN) stock is currently about 6% shy of its 52-week intra-day peak of $201.20 reached on July 8. Following a second-quarter revenue miss and less-than-rosy guidance for the third quarter, the stock closed at a low of $161.02 on August 5, but has staged a comeback ever since, closing Monday’s trade at $189.07. Although the strength in its cloud business–Amazon Web Services (AWS)–continues to cast a halo on the rest of its services, experts opine that Amazon may be ceding market share to Microsoft’s fast-growing cloud platform, Azure. The ballooning costs for Amazon’s ambitious Kuiper satellite internet project triggered an analyst downgrade on fears that it could slow down the pace of margin expansion. With third-quarter earnings slated for release on October 31, should investors buy into Amazon stock now, or wait to see how the earnings pan out? What are the metrics investors should look for in Amazon’s upcoming earnings print? What is the long-term outlook for Amazon stock? Amazon has outperformed earnings estimates over the last four quarters by a wide range of 18% to 59%. The highest beat was in the third quarter of last year. Sources: Company Press Releases, Seeking Alpha Amazon had a revenue miss in the most recent second quarter, following revenue beats in the previous three quarters. A beat by $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 marked the best revenue outperformance.

Amazon is scheduled to release its third quarter results on October 31. Analysts expect Amazon to report EPS of $1.14 on revenues of $157.2 billion, representing increases of 21.3% and 9.9%, respectively, from year-ago numbers. Amazon guided third-quarter net sales to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, representing 8% to 11% growth from year-ago numbers of $143.1 billion. Since, the midpoint of this range was below the consensus estimate, the stock sank to a low of $161.02 on August 5. Although the stock has staged a nice recovery since then, it is yet to revisit its July 8 intraday high of $201.20. Amazon sees third-quarter operating income of $11.5 billion to $15 billion vs. year-ago $11.2 billion. In the third quarter of 2023, Amazon beat its own guidance, outperformed EPS estimates by a whopping 59% and revenue estimates by $1.6 billion, but the mid-point of its fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $160 billion to $167 billion fell below the consensus of $166.6 billion. Yet, the stock rallied 35% from its October 26, 2023 (third-quarter earnings release date) closing price of $119.57 to end trade at $161.26 on Jan 29, 2024 (just ahead of Amazon’s fourth-quarter earnings announcement on February 1). Amazon’s third-quarter results typically benefit from the Amazon Prime Day, a 48-hour shopping event held usually in July with excellent deals for shoppers seeking good bargains. Amazon’s upcoming third-quarter earnings print will include sales from the Prime Day 2024, which the online retail giant called “its biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales” but did not quantify. However, competition is catching up with Amazon’s revenue drive. The Prime Day has spurred other retailers to jump in with their promotions. Adobe Analytics estimates that online shoppers spent an estimated $14.2 billion across U.S. retailers in the July two-day period this year, up 11% from last year’s $12.7 billion. Amazon beat its own revenue guidance and analysts’ revenue estimates in three out of the last four quarters. A third-quarter earnings beat is likely in the cards, given Amazon’s EPS beats for four quarters in a row and just one miss over the past eight quarters. However, past performance holds no guarantees for the future. According to data from Synergy Research Group, which tracks IT and cloud data, Amazon remained the market leader among cloud providers during the June-2024 quarter with a 32% market share, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 12%. Comparing this to December quarter numbers of 2020, AWS had a 31% market share vs. Azure’s 20% and Google Cloud’s 7%. Azure and Google Cloud have grown market share at a quicker pace since 2020, but not at the cost of AWS. It is also encouraging to see that second-quarter 2024 enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services rose 22% year over year to $79 billion worldwide, marking the third consecutive quarter of year over year growth of 20% or more, thanks to generative AI. As for revenues, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud group, which includes Azure revenue, reported $28.5 billion in revenue for the June quarter, up 19% year over year, while operating income for the segment rose to $12.9 billion, from $10.5 billion in the year-ago period. Amazon reported AWS sales of $26.3 billion, up 19% year over year. AWS operating income was $9.3 billion vs. year-ago $5.4 billion. Google Cloud reported sales of $10.3 billion up 29% from the year-ago period. Operating income for Google Cloud rose to $1.2 billion from $395 million last year. The catch here is Microsoft does not break out Azure dollar figures separately. So, it’s a bit complicated to understand Azure consumption. However, Microsoft has updated its reporting structure, under which the new Azure number is expected to now align more closely to its consumption business. This could pave the way for a better comparison process with AWS. Amazon stock is a bullish bet for the long term and here are factors that are expected to stimulate growth forward. Profitability has always been a sticky point with Amazon. The focus has been on growth vs. profits. Operating margins have never touched double digits until the first quarter of 2024, prior to which the best number was 8.2% for the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2024, operating margin rose to 10.7% from 7.8% in the fourth quarter, thanks to CEO Andy Jassy’s cost-cutting initiatives and stronger performance of higher-margin businesses like advertising and cloud computing. In the second quarter of 2024, operating margin was 9.9%. For the third quarter, operating margin is expected to be between 7.3% and 9.5% based on operating income guidance of $11.5 billion to $15 billion, on net sales of $154 billion to $158.5 billion. The resurgence in digital advertising amid the beginning of the Fed rate easing cycle and inflation moderating close to the Fed’s targets, should continue to power Amazon’s advertising revenues. Brands cut back on advertising spend in 2022, after inflation reached the highest levels in four decades and the Fed began to hike rates as an inflation reduction measure. Amazon’s ad revenues have grown more than 20% year over year during the last six quarters. For the first and second quarters of 2024, ad revenue increased 24% to $11.8 billion and 20% to $12.8 billion, respectively, year over year. In its June earnings call, Amazon said that it added more than $2 billion in advertising revenue year over year and generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. The online ad business is small compared to Amazon’s online retail business, but growing at a solid pace, and will remain a key contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. Amazon competes against Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet, which continue to dominate the digital ad space. Meta’s second-quarter sales, the bulk of which is generated from advertising, rose 22% year over year to $39.1 billion, while Google reported second-quarter ad sales of $64.6 billion, up 11% from the year ago period. Ad sales in the YouTube division rose 13% to $8.7 billion. Events like the Paris Olympics and elections in the U.S have fueled ad spending in 2024. Sponsored ads drive the majority of Amazon’s advertising revenue, while an expansion into Prime Video ads earlier this year will set the stage for future growth. Amazon is leveraging AI to improve the relevance of ads and in improving measures that allow brands to see the returns on their ad spend. Going forward, advertising on Prime Video will be an integral part of the digital ad business model, as it gives large advertisers a platform to pitch a product or service before a huge and growing audience. Amazon Prime Video viewership in September rose 12%—recording the strongest monthly growth in September among streaming platforms–thanks to Thursday Night Football and The Rings of Power, according to Nielsen, which specializes in audience measurement, data and analytics. However, Amazon will keep the ad loads lighter on Prime relative to linear TV and other streaming TV providers, as well as provide an ad-free streaming option for subscribers for an additional $2.99 per month. In 2025, Amazon plans to roll out Prime Video ads in Brazil, India, Japan, the Netherlands and New Zealand complementing its current presence in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Spain. Amazon is positioning AWS to serve the strong demand across both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads, as businesses migrate from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud amid robust enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services. AWS is at an annualized revenue run rate of more than $105 billion with second quarter revenue of $26.3 billion growing 18.8% year over year, accelerating from the 17.2% year over year growth in the first quarter, and 13% year over year growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. Thanks to Amazon’s cost discipline, AWS reported an operating margin of 35.5% for the June quarter vs. year-ago 24.2%. The AWS backlog was a whopping $156.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up about 19% y-o-y. So, it is not surprising that Amazon’s capital investments for the second half of 2024, will be higher than the $30.5 billion it spent in the first half, and a bulk of that spending will be directed towards AWS infrastructure. Project Kuiper is Amazon’s ambitious initiative to establish a satellite internet network to provide high-speed internet to underserved and unserved regions globally, by launching 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit. A new report from Space industry consultancy Quilty Space, says the costs for Project Kuiper may be spiraling way beyond Amazon’s estimate of $10 billion to a staggering $16.5 billion to $20 billion. While this may not seem particularly concerning in view of Amazon’s trailing 12-month free cash flow of $51.4 billion (adjusted for equipment finance leases), which has surged by 664% year-over-year–it remains a noteworthy figure. A more pressing challenge for Amazon is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license, which stipulates that at least half of the satellites need to be deployed by mid-2026. To comply with the FCC’s 2026 deadline, Amazon and its partners must push launch rates to unprecedented levels within the realm of private space operations. Quilty believes that the reliance of Amazon on all-new launch vehicles may also be an impediment to the launch, and Amazon may have to likely seek an extended timeline from the FCC. Even before Project Kuiper can get off the ground, it already has competition from Starlink, which has over 6,000 satellites in orbit. Starlink is a subsidiary of Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Despite SpaceX’s head-start advantage, there’s no stopping Amazon from making a market for itself. For one, AWS supports a third of the globe’s internet infrastructure, benefiting Kuiper with a pre-existing customer base unlike Starlink that had to build its subscriber base from ground up. Amazon launched its first two prototype satellites on October 6, 2023, and reported achieving 100% success. Amazon will begin deploying its satellite constellation in early 2025 and rolling out the commercial service later in the year. In its second-quarter earnings call, Amazon said that overall North America segment operating margin decreased slightly due to increased second-quarter spend in some investment areas, including Kuiper, kicking off a debate among analysts on Kuiper’s impact on operating margins. The concerns may appear slightly exaggerated because the North America segment operating margin for the second quarter was 5.6%, up 170 basis points year over year and down 20 basis points quarter over quarter. But the concerns are justified, as analysts estimate Kuiper spending to generate losses of up to $1 billion in the December quarter, up from $600 million in the second quarter. The losses could balloon to an estimated $5 billion to $6 billion next year, before the service starts to generate any meaningful revenue. However, Amazon declined to quantify the incremental investment for Kuiper in the second quarter earnings call. Investors can watch if it provides some color in the third-quarter earnings call. Quilty estimates that Kuiper can help Amazon generate $36 billion in annual revenues, if it can reach 100 million subscriptions at an average monthly ARPU [average revenue per user] of $30. The estimate appears quite conservative compared to the $4.2 billion in sales generated by Starlink's 2.3 million paying users in 2023, implying about $1,826 in ARPU. Amazon has secured partnerships with prominent telecom providers such as Verizon, Vodafone, and NTT, setting up Kuiper to deliver connectivity services for airplanes, ships, and other mobile platforms. According to the Quilty report, beyond Kuiper’s role as an internet service provider, If it can be positioned additionally as an alternative to Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and customized to deliver positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services, it could significantly enhance Kuiper’s value for military and commercial applications.

Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan expects Amazon’s third quarter earnings report to reflect relatively stable eCommerce demand, and strong performance in advertising, driven by the expansion of initiatives such as video, connected TV, and international markets, and solid U.S. eComm advertising growth. Sheridan expects continued acceleration for AWS, as previous headwinds such as the impact of cloud optimization.ease. The analyst reiterates a Buy rating and $230 price target on AMZN stock. Wedbush analysts reiterated an Outperform rating and $225 price target for the stock. Wedbush expects Amazon’s operating income to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years, mainly due to its transition to higher-margin advertising, as well as AWS revenue. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Ken Gawrelski has downgraded AMZN stock from overweight to equal weight, trimming the price target from $225 to $183—one of Wall Street's most conservative projections. While AWS continues to thrive, it falls short of generating positive estimate revisions in the near future. Additional headwinds, including investments in Project Kuiper, rising pressures from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and moderating advertising contributions, are poised to cast a shadow on Amazon's earnings growth, according to the analyst. Analyzing Amazon's investment potential, particularly in the context of earnings announcements, leads to the conclusion that buying AMZN stock post-earnings may be a better approach. This way, investors can potentially mitigate downside risk and capitalize on asymmetric reward opportunities, benefiting from the latest financial disclosures and operational insights. Amazon Prime Day and Holiday shopping season are near-term catalysts for the retail business, while the proposal to regulate de minimis shipments may offer an enduring advantage against discount rivals. Amazon’s AI growth may likely stem from its home-grown AI chips that may attract businesses seeking improved price-performance options. Accelerating revenue growth, and a strong backlog, amid increased enterprise spending on infrastructure modernization will act as tailwinds for AWS. Despite all the concerns about Kuiper investment costs, the satellite-internet segment presents compelling economics for long-term growth, especially for Amazon with its pre-existing customer base. The impending rollout of Prime Video ads across additional markets, combined with a rise in viewership, is likely to bolster the high-margin online advertising business, and somewhat alleviate overall profitability growth concerns. For the long term, Amazon stock remains a compelling buy.

Title: Ford is paying dealers $20K+ to order 2024 F-150 Lightning trucks

Posted on 10/22/2024 12:05:12 PM PDT by Red Badger A mysterious "cooling EV sentiment" has affected nearly every automaker, and even Ford’s once white-hot electric pickup truck may be starting to feel the burn. As dealers struggle to sell remaining 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning models, Ford is inventing new ways to move metal. One way is by introducing Retail Replenishment Centers (RRCs), locations dedicated to holding inventory to manage flooring costs and space for dealers. Ford is enticing dealers to “buy now,” and dealerships can earn up to $22,500 per month by ordering trucks from the RRC. Ford hopes to move more electric trucks with dramatic dealer incentives According to a new memo circulating the web, Ford is offering dealers up to $1,000 per unit when they restock their Lightning inventory via the RRC. But, that figure creeps up to $1,500 each when the dealer orders nine or more units – up to a maximum of 15. Since Ford has offered to pay retroactively to the first unit, that means a total of $22,500 is sitting on the table. The program will run from October 15 until November 15 of this year, and Ford says it’s a win-win situation. Dealers can save space while still offering shoppers the same or more flexibility in the model they choose. It could backfire; some dealerships may take advantage of the rebate only to find that it simply doesn’t make sense to normally have the Lightning in stock. That could diminish choices for shoppers – and competition for Lightning-stocked Ford dealers. Almost every 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning is eligible for the rebate No need for dealers or shoppers to pick and choose, either. Eligible trim levels include the XLT, Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trim levels of the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning. That’s every trim level that Ford currently offers, sans the work-truck spec F-150 Lightning Pro. As the least-expensive trim in the Lightning stable, it’s currently reserved for fleet sales – and not generally eligible for retail sale. Limited Lightnings on the lot could be a bad thing There are potential downsides to this strategy. Ford dealers might realize that having one or two Lightnings on the lot is more than enough. So, customers might have a lot more limited options when arranging test drives. Potential customers that want to touch and feel the exact product before buying may be driven elsewhere, too. Generally, the pros should outweigh the cons - driving dealers to offer more attractive pricing and hopefully motivating dealers behind the times to start pushing EVs a little more seriously. The extra rebate makes a 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning an even more attractive proposition. As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months – and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That’s nearly unheard of, thanks to where today’s interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don’t really have the same incentives on hand, but they’d probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the “Ford Power Promise” - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it’s important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they’re looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of – at least what’s being touted as – waning consumer sentiment. Or, they’re just making room for the 2025s – at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you’re looking.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Dealers can save space while still offering shoppers the same or more flexibility in the model they choose. It could backfire; some dealerships may take advantage of the rebate only to find that it simply doesn’t make sense to normally have the Lightning in stock. That could diminish choices for shoppers – and competition for Lightning-stocked Ford dealers. Almost every 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning is eligible for the rebate No need for dealers or shoppers to pick and choose, either. Eligible trim levels include the XLT, Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trim levels of the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning. That’s every trim level that Ford currently offers, sans the work-truck spec F-150 Lightning Pro. As the least-expensive trim in the Lightning stable, it’s currently reserved for fleet sales – and not generally eligible for retail sale. Limited Lightnings on the lot could be a bad thing There are potential downsides to this strategy. Ford dealers might realize that having one or two Lightnings on the lot is more than enough. So, customers might have a lot more limited options when arranging test drives. Potential customers that want to touch and feel the exact product before buying may be driven elsewhere, too. Generally, the pros should outweigh the cons - driving dealers to offer more attractive pricing and hopefully motivating dealers behind the times to start pushing EVs a little more seriously. The extra rebate makes a 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning an even more attractive proposition. As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months – and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That’s nearly unheard of, thanks to where today’s interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don’t really have the same incentives on hand, but they’d probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the “Ford Power Promise” - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers.

Eligible trim levels include the XLT, Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trim levels of the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning. That’s every trim level that Ford currently offers, sans the work-truck spec F-150 Lightning Pro. As the least-expensive trim in the Lightning stable, it’s currently reserved for fleet sales – and not generally eligible for retail sale. Limited Lightnings on the lot could be a bad thing There are potential downsides to this strategy. Ford dealers might realize that having one or two Lightnings on the lot is more than enough. So, customers might have a lot more limited options when arranging test drives. Potential customers that want to touch and feel the exact product before buying may be driven elsewhere, too. Generally, the pros should outweigh the cons - driving dealers to offer more attractive pricing and hopefully motivating dealers behind the times to start pushing EVs a little more seriously. The extra rebate makes a 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning an even more attractive proposition. As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months – and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That’s nearly unheard of, thanks to where today’s interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don’t really have the same incentives on hand, but they’d probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the “Ford Power Promise” - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it’s important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they’re looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of – at least what’s being touted as – waning consumer sentiment. Or, they’re just making room for the 2025s – at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you’re looking.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months – and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That’s nearly unheard of, thanks to where today’s interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don’t really have the same incentives on hand, but they’d probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the “Ford Power Promise” - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it’s important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they’re looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of – at least what’s being touted as – waning consumer sentiment. Or, they’re just making room for the 2025s – at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you’re looking.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Title: Earnings call: Fiserv reports strong Q3 results, raises full-year guidance
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-fiserv-reports-strong-q3-results-raises-fullyear-guidance-93CH-3675923
Time Published: 2024-10-22T18:22:54Z
Full Content:
Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) has reported a robust performance in its third quarter of 2024, with significant increases in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and revenue. The company announced adjusted EPS of $2.30, a 17% rise, and a 7% increase in adjusted revenue, reaching $4.9 billion. The adjusted operating margin improved to 40.2%, and organic revenue growth was a strong 15%. Fiserv's Merchant Solutions and Financial Solutions segments experienced substantial organic growth, contributing to a free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the quarter. Strategic developments, such as partnerships with DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and the growth of the Clover platform, have positioned the company for sustained growth. Fiserv raised its full-year organic revenue growth guidance to 16%-17% and adjusted EPS expectations to $8.73-$8.80. Fiserv's third-quarter results demonstrate a company on the rise, with strategic partnerships and innovative initiatives paving the way for future success. The company's management remains confident in their growth trajectory, supported by strong performance indicators and a clear vision for expansion, both domestically and internationally. As Fiserv continues to execute its strategy, the market will be watching closely to see how these plans unfold in the coming quarters. Fiserv's robust third-quarter performance is further underscored by key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at an impressive $114.18 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the financial services industry. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Fiserv is a "prominent player in the Financial Services industry." The company's revenue growth of 7.2% over the last twelve months, as reported by InvestingPro, is consistent with the 7% increase in adjusted revenue mentioned in the earnings report. This steady growth trajectory is complemented by a strong gross profit margin of 60.96%, indicating efficient cost management and pricing power. Fiserv's profitability is evident in its adjusted operating income of $5.387 billion and an operating income margin of 27.23% for the last twelve months. This robust profitability supports the InvestingPro Tip that the company has been "profitable over the last twelve months" and that "analysts predict the company will be profitable this year." The stock's performance has been particularly noteworthy, with InvestingPro data showing a one-year price total return of 72.38% and a year-to-date return of 49.78%. This exceptional performance is captured by the InvestingPro Tip highlighting the "high return over the last year" and that the stock is "trading near 52-week high," with the price at 98.98% of its 52-week high. While Fiserv's P/E ratio of 34.14 suggests it's "trading at a high earnings multiple," the PEG ratio of 0.72 indicates it may be undervalued relative to its growth prospects. This is further supported by the InvestingPro Tip that Fiserv is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth." For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Fiserv, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position. Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to the earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today. As we share our third quarter results this morning, it is increasingly clear that our position at the intersection of merchant and financial solutions is a strategic advantage. Fiserv delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.30, up 17%, driven by strong revenue growth and further operating margin expansion across our businesses. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 170 basis points to 40.2%. Organic revenue growth was 15%. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, and we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchase. Businesses and financial institutions are increasingly interconnected, and Fiserv has a key role to play here given our unmatched set of assets across software, data, technology and, of course, scale and experience in moving money. Here are two examples in just the past month. First, we announced this morning with DoorDash, we began implementing a comprehensive embedded finance application poised to be a best-in-class solution for gig economy company. This solution enables DoorDash to offer its delivery contractors a full range of financial services. Within a single app, they can get instant access to wages and rewards, as well as deposit accounts, debit cards and more. Our real-time ledger capability from Finxact manages the transactions and was a key reason why Fiserv was chosen. A Fiserv banking client rounded out the solution as a requisite sponsor. Second, we completed a proof of concept with Walmart where we enabled a real-time Pay by Bank transaction at the point of sale over our proprietary NOW Network. A growing number of merchants are adding Pay by Bank capability to maximize choice for consumers and the emerging capacity for handling such payments in real time offers advantages for Fiserv, merchants and consumers. This capability will be more widely available next year via our NOW Network. Additionally, we teamed up with Walmart Business as a referral partner for Clover as a business management platform, helping Walmart fulfill its goal of helping small businesses and non-profits to better run their businesses. In a separate but related testament to our product strength and position as a partner of choice, today Inc. magazine named Clover to its 2024 Power Partners list, which recognizes the best B2B providers for SMBs. Let me share some of the many highlights of the quarter. It was another strong quarter of growth in the Merchant Solutions segment, with organic revenue up 24%. At Clover, revenue grew 28% and value-added services penetration reached 21%, up 1 percentage point from Q2. In Latin America, we expanded the friends and family Clover pilots in Brazil and Mexico as planned with a full-scale launch coming in December. In Asia Pacific, we went live with our first Clover pilot in Australia in September. We also enabled the Enterprise Commerce Control Center, which allows merchants to monitor and analyze their business and transaction performance across locations, regions and operating segments in a single view. In Financial Solutions, we posted another quarter of strong organic revenue growth at 6%. The build out of CashFlow Central was completed in September and we have our first client gearing up to implement the solution in the next few months. And we continue to migrate clients to Experience Digital, or XD, our new digital banking solution, as we integrate additional solutions into this unique digital ecosystem, including CashFlow Central, real-time payments, Clover and more. We expect to see a multiplying effect on the average revenue per XD user over time. It was another quarter of marquee wins that demonstrate the power of Fiserv's integrated and value-added offerings. We were chosen to provide merchant acceptance services for a major e-com marketplace and expanded our long-standing partnership with Costco (NASDAQ:COST) to launch a stored value digital wallet. The service enables new payment and reward redemption experiences whether the retailer's customers are shopping online or in the warehouse. We continue to sign other enterprise merchants onto our value-added solutions. Another long-time enterprise client, Exxon (NYSE:XOM), signed on for a data-as-a-service offering. This solution is used to extract insights from integrated vendor, payments, consumer loyalty and wallet data. And because it runs in a cloud, we can reduce implementation time from months to days. Also in Q3, Ahold Delhaize, a global retailer whose portfolio includes Stop & Shop in the U.S. selected Fiserv as the provider of Pay by Bank services. Alex Lee, a large privately owned operator of multiple food companies, chose our Smart Routing technology for debit cost efficiency. We accelerated our signings of financial institutions as merchant acquirer referral partners. These included banks of all sizes as well as credit unions. Golden 1 Credit Union and America First Credit Union were two of the larger signings in Q3. In our three regions, we continue to see strong client momentum. We expanded our partnership with Netto, a major grocery chain in Europe. We'll provide several value-added services, including dynamic currency conversion, customer cashback and encryption solutions, in addition to supplying thousands of new PIN pads to accelerate transaction speed across their 700 stores in Poland. In Asia Pac, Fiserv was chosen by foodpanda, a subsidiary of Delivery Hero and one of the world's leading local delivery companies, to provide payment services across multiple markets in Asia. This strategic partnership spans online, mobile and digital wallets, positioning Fiserv as foodpanda's primary acquirer in Singapore and Hong Kong, processing over $1 billion in annual spend. We launched Clover Sport at Bombonera in Argentina. This is one of the country's largest soccer stadiums and home to one of the top teams in the league. Clover's presence there can add to awareness in the region. To optimize the fan experience for fast and easy concession services, the stadium, through our ISV partner, chose the Clover platform to accept payments in three ways: through QR codes, self-service kiosks and mobile handheld devices. Moving to the Financial Solutions segments, four banks signed on for CashFlow Central in the past three months, including our first credit union for a total of 10 since we announced the initiative a year ago. AvidXchange will be using the CheckFree biller directory to support faster bill payment on its mid-market B2B exchange. In September, we won a competitive bid with Farm Credit Mid-America, a cooperative that reaches across six states. We'll be converting their loan portfolio to DNA and integrating several other value-added solutions. PNC signed up for our AI-enabled Advance Defense product for enhanced fraud detection in their card issuing business. Equitas Small Finance Bank was the latest India issuer to go live on our India processing hub, successfully launching a new retail and corporate card product with a full-stack offering, including loyalty, offers and real-time fraud management, as well as credit on UPI, India's real-time account-to-account payment system. And we continue to build our capability here as a market leader with seven of the 10 largest credit card issuers in India on our platform. In September, we hosted 3,000 Fiserv clients and prospects at our annual Client Conference forum. This group of attendees represent nearly 50% of our North American institutional revenue across the Merchant and Financial Solutions segments and nearly 60% of our new business pipeline through 2025. After three days of demos across 75 booths in our Experience Center, over 100 well-attended product and technology information sessions and thousands of client meetings, we strengthened our relationships and partnerships, expanded our pipeline of opportunities and generated enthusiasm for our offerings, setting the stage for continued strong growth in the future. One of the many highlights at Forum this year was our SMB bundle. The premise behind this suite of products is that small- and medium-sized businesses have a complex landscape to navigate for managing their businesses and they prefer a single easy-to-use system. With our own products and partnerships, Fiserv is the only financial technology expert with solutions that cut across the entire SMB value chain. Since the products and the clients for our SMB bundle span our Merchant and Financial Solutions segments, we have the unique opportunity to win business through the integration of solutions across both of our ecosystems. From our merchant ecosystem, we provide acceptance and processing, the Clover POS platform, Clover VAS, including vertical and horizontal business process software, capital, loyalty and gift solutions and the Small Business Index for localized insights. From our financial ecosystem, we provide CashFlow Central because cash management is a fundamental requirement for business success at SMBs. We also provide Optis for business card issuance, SpendTrack for expense management, Zelle for small business and core banking account management and digital banking. While we sell each of these separately now, next year, they will be integrated on our leading platforms. For FIs, the SMB bundle will integrate into digital banking environment such as Fiserv's Experience Digital or XD platform. For small businesses, the SMB bundle will integrate into the Clover Dashboard and be sold through all Clover channels. Lastly, I want to come back to something I said last quarter. Merchant-related services from Fiserv are back as an opportunity for financial institutions to compete and win. What's old is new again based on our innovations across the SMB bundle. It gives FIs a deeper view into an SMB's full financial position. With this knowledge and breadth of product, they can better grow and retain SMB clients and generate deposit and non-interest fees. We couple this capability with tools to help FIs readily find merchant customer leads and onboard them digitally. Showcasing our integrated SMB capabilities generated a lot of interest and ongoing engagement and we expect the SMB bundle to start contributing to growth next year. Turning to our guidance for the rest of the year, we are raising organic revenue growth from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%, and raising our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $8.73 to $8.80. As I look across all the new initiatives we are rolling out, I am pleased with how the vision and investment we put into motion five years ago has brought Fiserv to a strong position today, one that's clearly hard to replicate. The results show that we are executing on mandates for each of our two ecosystems, merchants and financial institutions. This will continue in many ways as we add to our Clover portfolio, extend services to enterprise merchants, expand issuing to new verticals and geographies, enable more real-time payments, modernize core banking systems, add partners, grow internationally, and continue to use distribution data and more. With this foundation of leadership and steady growth firmly established, we are moving to the next generation of solutions that answers the needs across both ecosystems. As the only provider serving both merchants and financial institutions with product breadth and technological scale we serve at the intersection between merchants and fintech, issuers and fintechs, acquiring and cash management, digital wallets and card services, spending and banking data, and many other combinations. This is not a vision. It is here today in our initiatives with DoorDash, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart, U.S. Bank, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) and others. Of course, these integrated opportunities are in their early stages. As excited as we are about them today, our measure of success will be strong sustainable growth for Fiserv over the medium and longer term. And now, I will turn it over to Bob for more detail on our financial performance. Bob Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning everyone. If you are following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Third quarter, again, demonstrated our capability to maintain strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Third quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.9 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $2 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 40.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue grew 7% to $14.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $5.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 38.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Organic revenue grew 15% in the quarter, driven by strength in both segments. The transitory contribution from excess inflation in Argentina was 3 points to our total organic growth in the quarter, down from 5 points in Q2. As mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, dólar turista extended into Q3 and contributed less than 0.5 point of total company organic growth in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.30 compared to $1.96 in the prior year, up 17% on the high end of our full year guidance provided last quarter of 15% to 17%. Year-to-date, our adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $6.29 compared to $5.34 in the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, and year-to-date free cash flow was $3.3 billion. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected free cash flow to be much higher in the second half of this year after a lighter first half due to the timing of cash flows for the green tax credit program. The related refund came through in the third quarter. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Slide 5, organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions segment was 24% in the quarter and 29% year-to-date. This includes a 6 point benefit from above-average inflation in Argentina in the quarter and a 10 point benefit year-to-date. While inflation remains high, interest rates in Argentina eased in late second quarter and are back to historical averages and, therefore, did not contribute to excess growth this quarter. The continuation of dólar turista contributed nearly 1 percentage point to Merchant organic revenue growth in the quarter and 3 points year-to-date. On Slide 6, we have again included a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and Merchant segment revenue along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation, which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for Merchant Solutions was 9% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date. The quarterly results include a 15 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso after a sharp devaluation in late December last year. Similar to Q2, the currency headwind to adjusted revenue growth was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind in the quarter. 2024 has been an outstanding year for new Clover hardware launches. Earlier this year, we brought to market the Kitchen Display System, or KDS XL, to manage orders and improve efficiency in a 24-inches formfactor that larger restaurants demand. We also launched the Kiosk, which allows for self-service ordering, reducing wait times and increasing average tickets. In Q3, we introduced a new version of the Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) handheld device called the Flex Pocket, which is 25% lighter, 50% thinner and oriented towards restaurant and waitstaff in retail. And most recently, we launched the Clover Compact, an entry-level solution that will help drive TAM expansion and create new VAS revenue opportunities. Now moving to the business lines. Small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 25% and 9%, respectively, on payment volume growth of 4%. This volume growth was similar to Q2 levels. According to a variety of external macro indicators, overall consumer spending growth is slower than last year, but appears stable at a comfortable pace. Fiserv's small business performance was ahead of our Small Business Index results, which showed year-over-year sales volume growth of 2.3% compared to 3.7% for Q2 and 2.8% for Q3 2023. The difference is likely attributable to our international presence and a slightly different mix of business. Fiserv is more heavily weighted to non-discretionary categories such as food and services, which have been growing faster. Clover revenue grew 28% in the third quarter on an annualized payment volume growth of 15%. VAS penetration increased sequentially by 1 point to 21% in Q3, driven by growth in Clover Capital and the Clover SaaS package. In Q4, we will be rolling out new vertical software plans for retail and services. With this progress, we remain on track to achieve our 2026 Clover targets of $4.5 billion in revenue and VAS penetration of 27%. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 37% and 17%, respectively, driven by transactions growth of 12% and higher VAS penetration. As with small business, organic growth in enterprise includes some transitory benefit in Argentina. Above-average growth in enterprise business reflects the ramping of a large PayFac from our processing customer to a direct client. Commerce Hub continues to see ongoing traction and is now processing almost 7 times the daily transactions versus Q1 and 2 times when compared to Q2. And clients are increasingly connected to enhanced solutions. Much of the Commerce Hub transaction growth comes from existing clients migrating to the Commerce Hub and the fact that they are now on the platform gives us the opportunity to sell more VAS going forward. Finally, processing organic revenue in the quarter declined by 1%, while adjusted revenue decreased 2%. This business represents the back-end processing we do for our bank and certain ISO partners where they own the merchant relationship. Year-to-date processing organic and adjusted revenue growth were both flat, consistent with our expectation. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solutions segment increased 19% to $931 million in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin up 290 basis points to 37.7%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 22% to $2.6 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 330 basis points to 36.2%. As noted in prior quarters, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in the operating income, Merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 190 basis points for the quarter and 260 basis points year-to-date. Turning to Slide 7, on the Financial Solutions segment, organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter and year-to-date, in line with our full year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5% in the quarter. Growth in Zelle transactions continue to be strong at 35%. We continue to see demand from clients for digital payments products such as FedNow and RTP integrations. CashFlow Central, our integrated AR/AP solution for SMBs, continues to see high interest from financial institutions. In the last three months, we signed two nearly-$10 billion institutions Amarillo National Bank and Tri Counties Bank. In total, we had four wins in the last three months, bringing the total to 10 since product announcement. In issuing, organic and adjusted revenue grew 7% and 4%, respectively, in the quarter, driven by demand across various verticals, including government and healthcare. During the quarter, we converted the remaining HealthEquity HSA and FSA card accounts to Optis, our issuing processing platform, solidifying our leadership in the healthcare card vertical. Banking organic and adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter. Last quarter, we spoke about signing a merchant agreement with Connecticut On-Line Computer Center, known as COCC, which is a client-owned provider of banking technology. In the third quarter, we expanded our relationship to include Experience Digital, or XD, which is our online and mobile banking solution. XD will now be available to the 150 community banks and credit unions on COCC solution. Third quarter adjusted operating income for the Financial Solutions segment was up 5% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin came in strong at 47.4%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $3.2 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 45.8%. Now, let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $112 million in the quarter and $394 million year-to-date, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% and 19.0% year-to-date. We expect the full year rate to be slightly below 20%. Total debt outstanding was $25.3 billion on September 30. Our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio went down from 2.8 times in the second quarter to 2.7 times in the third quarter, in line with our target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $1.3 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to $5.3 billion and over $16 billion since the 2019 merger. We had 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, as Frank said earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $8.73 to $8.80, up from $8.65 to $8.80. This is an acceleration in forecasted adjusted EPS growth to 16% to 17% from 15% to 17%. This is also a $0.04 raise at the midpoint from prior guidance and $0.14 from our original guidance. We are raising our 2024 organic revenue growth outlook from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted margin expansion outlook from more than 135 basis points to at least 150 basis points. Lastly, we are updating our free cash flow guidance from about $4.7 billion to above $4.7 billion, driven by the strong free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. Given the current environment in Argentina, we continue to assume 4 points of benefit from excess inflation and interest this year for the total company and 9 points for Merchant Solutions. We now see the dólar turista program continuing into the fourth quarter, but easing through the end of the year. Our full year outlook of 16% to 17% total company organic growth includes a 4 point transitory benefit from inflation and interest in Argentina and just over 1 point of growth from dólar turista. Excluding these combined transitory factors, 2024 organic revenue growth would be 11% to 12% at the upper end of our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange remains 8.5% and we anticipate will continue to be a stronger though declining headwind to adjusted revenue growth relative to the tailwind from excess inflation and interest. Finally, in the past month, we made progress on three items that many of you have been asking about over the last month. While these do not have an outsized impact on our financials given the scale of our business, they demonstrate our ability to navigate ongoing change in our business in a way that is not disruptive and always open to opportunity. First, as previously reported, we expect Wells Fargo to take ownership of our 40% owned joint venture Wells Fargo Merchant Services on April 1, 2025, at which time, we will receive cash or assets for our portion of the business. Fiserv will continue to provide processing services to Wells' existing and new merchants along with other related services. As a result, we see no change to our medium-term outlook of 9% to 12% adjusted revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted EPS growth from this transaction. Secondly, we extended our merchant processing joint venture with PNC for the fifth time. The relationship dates back to 1996, supporting PNC small business and enterprise clients with hardware and processing services from Fiserv and we expect Clover to have a growing presence from here. And third, the State of Georgia approved our application for a merchant acquirer limited purpose bank charter. This approval from the state allows Fiserv to apply for direct acceptance into the card networks and is anticipated to be operational in 2025. This is a special purpose charter that enables optionality for sponsorship for merchant acquiring. It's important to clarify that Fiserv is not becoming a bank. Fiserv will not open branches, take deposits or write loans as traditional banks do. We have no intention in doing that and in fact the charter itself does not permit these traditional banking activities. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Frank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our corporate social responsibility initiatives, not because these are investment parameters, but because they represent who we are as a company. Hurricanes Helene and Milton were devastating for millions of people and businesses, including many Fiserv clients. Our response, as always, is to take action and we quickly sent support to the Red Cross and personally delivered supplies to the affected areas. As part of our partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and our investment to support its disaster preparedness and recovery effort for small businesses, we provided the Chamber with Fiserv Small Business Index data on the impact of the hurricanes. These granular insights on commerce levels leading up to, during and after these natural disasters are being used to educate policymakers and stakeholders, guide targeted response investments and inform philanthropic support efforts that create and boost small business recovery. Also in the quarter, Fiserv achieved a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index and was recognized as a Top Veteran-Friendly Company by US Veterans Magazine, each for the third year in a row. The National Bankers Association, a trade organization that represents all minority depository institutions, presented Fiserv with its Corporate Excellence Award, making us the first large-scale tech provider to receive this honor. Finally, we continue to advance our sustainability and green building design strategy. Our Milwaukee headquarters recently achieved LEED Gold status following our Dublin, Ireland and New Jersey Innovation Centers, which achieved LEED Platinum status previously. These are just some examples of how our hard work and dedication show up in many quarters, but most importantly, it showed up in the strong financial performance you just heard. This put us at the top of the IDC FinTech Rankings for a second straight year, and our story today is about how we intend to stay there. I'd like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their contributions to these significant achievements and for the day-to-day blocking and tackling that has produced consistently strong results. That's 40 years of building trust, scale and experience, and five years since the merger of achieving innovation through unmatched investment across our merchant and financial ecosystems. So, now, operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien-Tsin Huang: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the update here. I want to ask on enterprise. It did accelerate nicely more than the transaction growth that you put up there. So, I heard, Bob, you mentioned it was transitory part of it and then there was a PayFac conversion to a retail relationship, it sounds like. So, can you just maybe go through that and what's a good sustainable level as we think about the fourth quarter? Bob Hau: Yeah, Tien-Tsin, good morning. So, you're right, we did see an increase in transactions. Transaction growth in the quarter was up 12% over prior year. That actually matches what we saw in Q1. It's up from the 8% we saw in Q2. We definitely see some variation, particularly when we bring on new clients, some of them in this enterprise space can be quite large. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have a large PayFac begin to really ramp in the third quarter. We will see a little bit of that continue in fourth quarter as they get to full capability or full volume, and then it will return to "more normal levels." Overall for that business line, we obviously saw very good organic growth, well ahead of the overall company average on an adjusted basis, which again that has also impact from Argentina in it. We feel great about the year-to-date at 11% on an adjusted basis. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller: Guys, thanks. And nice results. Can we just start with -- overall the business is showing really strong signs of cross-sell. And I know, Frank, you alluded to that in your prepared remarks and how you're really packaging together more and more between segments. Maybe just some very specific examples of where you see that shaping up? And then, just if you could reiterate your conviction around the Financial Solutions segment accelerating into '25. I think you said going to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. Just reiterate why and what the driving force is and what you're seeing? Thanks, guys. Frank Bisignano: So, I'd like to go back to something I'd like to say the construction of the company, right? I always believe that this was a very strategic set of assets we put together that were highly complementary five years ago. And one quick place to think about it is in merchant and FI, just in total, our ability to be the strategic partner of choice to deliver merchant and FI and put Clover on the front end of that. And then, really there is the power of owning a debit network and the ability of what to bring to our largest institutions and to our client base across merchants. And then, you go a step further and the future of the growth initiatives in terms of us talking about the SMB bundle and the ability to take all the assets we have and integrate them technically now, right? You see us on the front line there with Apple Pay and then you can see us with issuers in another spot and then see us weaving the place together and the ability of the crossroads of merchants and FIs, I think Walmart is a great example of it. I think DoorDash is a great example of it, right? And so, then you think about, okay, you got Finxact, you're bringing Finxact in as a [handless core] (ph) to be actually a ledger here for the famous Dashers. And then you go, okay, you put XD and Clover together and deliver a capability to every financial institution that runs on us. And you take a look at our international expansion and you look at the work on Commerce Hub, now showing up in the enterprise segment. So, I think the construction of the company with financial institutions all the way through from the largest to a credit union or a local community bank, and then you take on top of that the assets we bring to it. So, I mean, you're seeing it and then we brought 3,000 people to forum and I think you were there, too, if I am right. And I mean you saw the power of the franchise first-hand. So, we think that's why we see such sustainable growth for the long term, and we always think we can do our job better, too. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Harshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. Frank, can you talk about STAR and Accel, especially given some of the changes happening in the U.S.? Maybe talk about their PINless capabilities [indiscernible] Signature capabilities, how STAR is positioned to grow? Thank you. Frank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I think one of the things to think about is we always believe that we wanted the capability to compete for transactions for our client benefit, right, for our client benefit. And that window opens up. STAR/Accel is clearly a strategic asset to sit at the crossroads of merchants and financial institutions. We believe our capability is strong on PIN. We have the signature capability. We do have dual-messaging capability. And we give our merchants and issuers choices to compete for transactions at every level. So, that's the strategy, right? The strategy is to support our client base. We believe it too is one of these steady opportunity you're not going to see this meteoric rise of transactions, but you'll continue to see volume share gains and we'll continue to have an asset in our repertoire to help both our merchants and our financial institutions. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions on Clover. I know revenue growth was steady here, volume growth ticked down a little bit. Just any thoughts on Q4 expectations for those metrics? I think the volume comps get a little bit harder, revenue also next quarter. So, just wanted to get a sense of how we should be thinking about near-term trajectory there. I know you've got some new country launches, product launches to support it. Bob Hau: Yeah, Jason, good morning. So, yes, we continue to see good overall revenue and volume growth out of our Clover solution. As you know, we've got a target to be $4.5 billion by 2026. That gets us where we needed about the 28% compound growth rate to achieve that. It's exactly where we were for the quarter. It's where we are on a year-to-date basis. A key part of that is continuing to add value-added services that ticked up 1 point to 21% of revenue. Overall, volume remains good. It obviously isn't as strong as it was last year. Some of that is very strong last year. So, a little bit of a difficult comp, but also the consumer, while still strong, still spending, has certainly eased a bit. We saw that last quarter. We saw that continue again this quarter. But we feel good about where that spending is right now and what we see going into the future. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. Good job. I guess, my question, in the SMB segment, for many quarters, you had kind of teens growth, kind of 13% to 17%. This quarter was 9% despite Clover being in the high-20%s for many quarters in a row. So, maybe what -- kind of what's happening outside of Clover, and then how should we expect that to reaccelerate going forward, or maybe just kind of talk through that? Bob Hau: Yeah. So, there's a number of things going on. Obviously, Argentina tailwind has eased quite meaningfully since last year beginning of this year even where we saw in first quarter, 15% benefit to the Merchant segment, easing down in second quarter to 10%, now down to 6%. And that impacts both, actually all three of our segments, but certainly a good portion of SMB volume -- excuse me, SMB revenue. The other thing that does play out is anticipation has been quite strong and there is a mix differential between -- or benefit differential between SMB and enterprise. We've seen particular strength out of the large enterprises down in Argentina. We see that kind of shifting a bit into the next couple of quarters. A bit difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen into Argentina in the future. I think we've gotten it pretty right over the last several quarters and we see that excess or that tailwind continuing to ease. You may have noticed in our presentation and our charts, inflation continues to be a tailwind, although easing meaningfully, but interest has actually returned back to more normal or historic levels. And so that tailwind is subsiding quite meaningfully. And then, of course, if you get to an adjusted revenue basis, FX continues to be a real headwind for us in the quarter for the segments. For the Merchant segment, we saw 15 point impact -- negative impact to our adjusted revenue from FX. So, all of those play out in SMB, both in Clover and non-Clover. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Tim Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I also want to revisit the Financial Solutions revenue guidance for next year, which is set to slightly accelerate, so from 5% to 7% this year to 6% to 8% next year. When we think about the reasons, there appears to be a good long list of very clear bullets. So, there's the Target business, there's Desjardins, there's Verizon. I believe all of those are expected to go live with their incremental revenue streams next year. And then, of course, there's the CashFlow Central. So, I was hoping you could touch on or maybe elaborate on any of those particular projects and/or maybe just talk a little bit about the confidence that you have in that reacceleration for next year? Frank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I think, we were greatly reinforced only a couple of weeks ago at our Client Conference where you heard me talk about the added pipe, the added interest and the amount of opportunity we see to grow our client base. That was not unexpected. That was exactly what we expected for the outcome. Today, on a year-to-date basis, we're a 6% grower as we were in the quarter. I think when you think about the repertoire, Finxact is growing clients right now, and that will continue to add. You saw us talk about what we're doing with DoorDash, that's creating another fundamental, as I use in my simple language, bundle, which is embedded finance, right? Then, you look at this SMB bundle, which I am being deep in every other week reviews for over a year. So, my conviction on the depth of that pipeline will be bringing that online and will be within the numbers. We talk about merchant and FI, but -- and that merchant part shows up in the merchant P&L, but the reality is that also is bringing along other opportunity within the banking segment. And then, we do and we'll continue to have opportunities even within the banking segment outside the U.S. that we see more of than we did before because of the nature and the construct of this company. And you tapped on the items that -- you touched on the items that we're bringing in. I'd add one other one. We believe our long-term opportunity around AI and data for our financial institutions, what I said to medium-sized to smaller banks, we need to be their data and AI engine. And that's our natural position with them. Now, that's not in forecast today. We don't have a number in a box, but we have demand and we have the best data in the industry and data drives AI. So, I would think about it that the fact we're posting a 6% and we have these engines behind us has such conviction of what we could do. And we can do all of it better as I say every day just in the base business. So that's why we've been able to produce at the level we have -- even if you look at our five-year margin, look what we've done there, and I'm not saying we're going to have never-ending margin expansion, but I sure work on it regularly. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results again. Frank, Clover Go and Clover Compact, they look like great solutions from micro sellers. Can you maybe give us a little bit of an update on the strategy and in terms of initial traction that you see on these new products? Thank you. Frank Bisignano: Yeah. We also see those products as augmentation products for our client base, right? So, I just want you to think about that way we talk about our ability to expand TAM in our own client base by bringing more. We definitely see the Compact playing in the food space. Obviously, we're early, but you should also think about international, right, that we're going to be bringing those products outside the U.S. in many cases, where, yes, we will still have software and VAS on top of them, but they may be catering to a different market. And we're going to have different forms of channel distribution. So, it gets us more software coming down a little bit [scale] (ph) in terms of merchant, but also augmenting our current client base to have a product that can work a little more mobile for them at times, too. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette: Thank you so much. I wanted to follow-up on the SMB bundle and this ties a little bit into Dan's question, but it seems like there's a lot of capability expansion that's happening within the Clover ecosystem and then looking at new ways to go to market. How should we be thinking about -- I know you gave some targets for back book and some of those things to get to the $4.5 billion target, but how should we be thinking about like the roles that those will play and if there's been any change in your thinking in terms of mix or type of customers and such within that Clover target? Thank you. Frank Bisignano: Yeah. I know there's only one question allowed, but that's like five. Good job, James. Let me try it. Like first of all, in some ways, there's not really -- inside this company that there's a ton of new thought. We always have a lot of R&D going on that historically and the IR team don't always love me for it, but they're more apt to talk to you about when we're getting to market than what's in the R&D shop. So, this idea about us bringing more capability to the SMB space has always been there. I think if you go back to our acquisition of Ondot and us embedding it in Mobiliti and then it became let's think about XD and a new product, but then you start saying to yourself, we could deliver this way beyond Clover and XD, we can integrate it all, we can put out Spendlabs acquisition there. Oh boy, we could end up helping LFI's grow and other channel partners and future partners to be signed up. That's why we are ultimately a partner of choice for people who want to partner in the SMB space because of our capability. So, I think you got to think about it that, yes, there may be more back book swept up in there because there's a reason beyond switching out your FD150 for a Clover station, now you have a much broader capability. None of this back book, if it happened, was ever more than our natural kind of rate, which we talked about of merchant churn going from an older device to a newer. But I think you're seeing the size of the opportunity to actually impact Clover more than we might have because of the full capability set. Thank you. I think you're on the right track there. Operator: Thank you. And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. On Clover international expansion, how long does it take to ramp a new country or region from the time you enter the market to when you reach peak run rate? And also, should we expect sort of a steady rhythm of new markets for a while here, or are you going to kind of -- should we expect some pauses where you build out and sort of spool up in the countries you've already launched in? Frank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I'm a funny guy. I think we're going to get to peak run rate never because we're just going to keep driving more. So, that's kind of the journey we're on. But if you want to pick a country like Brazil, right, I'll be down there on the kick-off of it in December for the launch in Brazil and Mexico. I remember us launching Argentina, call it, four years ago. So, first of all, it's the full build to get to market. As we launch it, we expect it in Brazil, perfect example, to capture more merchants and more revenue opportunities than we do today immediately. Now, our ability to scale at the peak, we have great partners. I think if you were sitting with our Head of Latin America, he would say Caixa is very motivated. Well, that's a huge distribution. Now, we're going to get them trained. They are doing that right now and ready to distribute. So, it affects growth rate in '25, but I see Brazil as a multiyear build and a multiyear ramp. Not because we weren't able to get to all the zip codes or towns, if you want to think about it, but adoption. And then, so it's a multiyear ramp. But much like CashFlow Central of Brazil is in next year's number at some level, nowhere near where it'll be three years from now. So, I'd like to thank everybody for your attention today. Please reach out to our IR team with any further questions. And have a great day, and thanks for your participation. Operator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Steve Ballmer, Jamie Dimon Weigh In (Update)

Time Published: 2024-10-22T17:52:57Z
Full Content:
Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 81 billionaires supporting Harris and 52 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: Ellison and Griffin are perhaps the most surprising billionaires who have stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering both have donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Griffin (Citadel) confirmed Thursday he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), while Griffin, the 39th-wealthiest, had been a Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) supporter. A total of 81 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: (Updated Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. A total of 52 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: (Updated Oct. 16) The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings. He gave another $43.6 million to a pro-Trump committee from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, becoming the second-most prolific donor in Trump’s camp this year, trailing only Adelson. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. (Updated Oct. 22): The New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. Tangent A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: vindarel: Running my 4th Common Lisp script in production© - you can do it too
URL: https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/running-my-4th-lisp-script-in-production/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T17:19:26Z

📢 ⭐ NEW: 9 videos (86min) about CLOS on my Common Lisp course. Learn more and stay tuned. 🎥 I also have cool Lisp showcases on Youtube . The last ones: how to build a web app in Common Lisp, part 1 and 2. Last week I finished a new service written in Common Lisp. It now runs in production© every mornings, and it expands the set of services I offer to clients. It’s the 4th service of this kind that I developed: - they are not big - but have to be done nonetheless, and the quicker the better (they each amount to 1k to 2k lines of Lisp code), - they are not part of a super advanced domain that requires Common Lisp superpowers - I am the one who benefits from CL during development, - I could have written them in Python - and conversely nothing prevented me from writing them in Common Lisp. So here lies the goal of this post: illustrate that you don’t need to need a super difficult problem to use Common Lisp. This has been asked many times, directly to me or on social media :) At the same time, I want to encourage you to write a little something about how you use Common Lisp in the real world. Sharing creates emulation. Do it! If you don’t have a blog you can simply write in a new GitHub repository or in a Gist and come share on /r/lisp. We don’t care. Thanks <3 We’ll briefly see what my scripts do, what libraries I use, how I deploy them, what I did along the way. Needless to say that I dogfooded my CIEL (beta) meta-library and scripting tool for all those projects. Table of Contents My latest script needs to read data from a DB, format what’s necessary according to specifications, and send the result by SFTP. In this case I read a DB that I own, created by a software that I develop and host. So I could have developed this script in the software itself, right? I could have, but I would have been tied to the main project’s versioning scheme, quirks, and deployment. I rather had to write this script on the side. And since it can be done on the side, it can be done in Common Lisp. I have to extract products and their data (price, VAT…), aggregate the numbers for each day, write this to a file, according to a specification. To read the DB, I used cl-dbi. I didn’t format the SQL with SxQL this time like in my web apps (where I use the Mito light ORM), but I wrote SQL directly. I’m spoiled by the Django ORM (which has its idiosyncrasies and shortcomings), so I double checked the different kinds of JOINs and all went well. I had to group rows by some properties, so it was a great time to use serapeum:assort. I left you an example here: https://dev.to/vindarel/common-lisps-group-by-is-serapeumassort-32ma Dates have to be handled in different formats. I used local-time of course, and I still greatly appreciate its lispy formatter syntax: the 2 in (:month 2) is to ensure the month is written with 2 digits. Once the file is written, I have to send it to a SFTP server, with the client’s codes. I wrote a profile class to encapsulate the client’s data as well as some functions to read the credentials from either environment variables, the file system, or a lisp variable. I had a top-level profile object for ease of testing, but I made sure that my functions formatting or sending data required a profile parameter. Still nothing surprising, but it’s tempting to only use global parameters for a one-off script. Except the program grows and you pay the mess later. To send the result through SFTP, I had to make a choice. The SFTP command line doesn’t make it possible to give a password as argument (or via an environment variable, etc). So I use lftp (in Debian repositories) that allows to do that. In the end, we format a command like this: You can format the command string and run it with uiop:run-program: no problem, but I took the opportunity to release another utility: First, you create a profile object. This one-liner reads the credentials from a lispy file: then you define the commands you’ll want to run: and finally you call the run method on a profile and a command. Tada. Build a binary the classic way (it’s all on the Cookbook), send it to your server, run it. (during a testing phase I have deployed “as a script”, from sources, which is a bit quicker to pull changes and try again on the server) Set up a CRON job. No Python virtual env to activate in the CRON environment… Add command line arguments the easy way or with the library of your choice (I like Clingon). My script #2 at the time was similar and simpler. I extract the same products but only take their quantities, and I assemble lines like For this service, we have to send the file to a simple FTP server. We have a pure Lisp library for FTP (and not SFTP) which works very well, cl-ftp. It’s a typical example of an old library that didn’t receive any update in years and so that looks abandoned, that has seldom documentation but whose usage is easy to infer, and that does its job as requested. For example we do this to send a file: I left you notes about cl-ftp and my SFTP wrapper here: A recent web app that I’m testing with a couple clients extends an existing stock management system. This one also was done in order to avoid a Python monolith. I still needed additions in the Python main software, but this little app can be independent and grow on its own. The app maintains its state and communicates it with a REST API. It gives a web interface to their clients (so my clients’ clients, but not all of them, only the institutional) so that they can: The peculiarities of this app are that: I deploy a self-contained binary: code + html templates in the same binary (+ the implementation, the web server, the debugger…), with Systemd. I wrote more on how to ship a standalone binary with templates and static assets with Djula templates here: I can connect to the running app with a Swank server to check and set parameters, which is super helpful and harmless. It is possible to reload the whole app from within itself and I did it with no hiccups for a couple years, but it isn’t necessary the most reliable, easiest to set up and fastest method. You can do it, but nobody forces you to do this because you are running CL in production. You can use the industry’s boring and best practices too. Common Lisp doesn’t inforce a “big ball of mud” approach. Develop locally, use Git, use a CI, deploy a binary… Every thing that I learned I documented it along the way in the Cookbook ;) Another app that I’ll mention but about which I also wrote earlier is my first web app. This one is open-source. It still runs :) In this project I had my friend and colleague contribute five lines of Lisp code to add a theme switcher in the backend that would help him do the frontend. He had never written a line of Lisp before. Of course, he did so by looking at my existing code to learn the existing functions at hand, and he could do it because the project was easy to install and run. He had to annotate the if branches :] This passed the code review. The 5th script/app is already on the way, and the next ones are awaiting that I open their .docx specification files. This one was a bit harder but the Lisp side was done sucessfully with the efficient collaboration of another freelance lisper (Kevin @vinn2010 to not name him). All those tasks (read a DB, transform data…) are very mundane. They are everywhere. They don’t always need supercharged web framework or integrations. You have plenty of opportunities to make yourself a favor, and use Common Lisp in the wild. Not counting the super-advanced domains where Lisp excels at ;) I have done some preliminary Common Lisp exploration prior to this course but had a lot of questions regarding practical use and development workflows. This course was amazing for this! I learned a lot of useful techniques for actually writing the code in Emacs, as well as conversational explanations of concepts that had previously confused me in text-heavy resources. Please keep up the good work and continue with this line of topics, it is well worth the price! [Preston, October of 2024] © Lisp journey. Like the content? Want to offer a ko-fi?

Title: Walmart to deliver prescriptions directly to customers in hit to sinking CVS, Walgreens
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/10/22/business/walmart-to-deliver-prescriptions-to-customers-doors/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T17:14:21Z
Full Content:
Walmart announced on Tuesday it will start delivering prescriptions straight to consumers’ doors in as little as 30 minutes – threatening to further cripple struggling pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens. The discount retailer has made its prescription delivery option available in Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin, the company said. Walmart expects the delivery option will be available in 49 states by the end of January — leaving out only North Dakota due to state laws. The delivery service is free for Walmart+ members. It will cost all other customers $9.95. Walmart hopes those needing prescriptions will also to tack on other items, like chicken noodle soup or tissues, to boost overall sales. Nearly 60% of Walmart’s annual revenue comes from its groceries division, but health and wellness is a growing category for the company. The health division accounts for about 12% of its annual revenue in the US, the company said in a filing for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31. The announcement of Walmart’s new speedy delivery system sent shares of CVS and Walgreens down 2.1% and 6.8%, respectively on Tuesday – despite both chains offering their own same-day delivery options. Walmart has a large consumer base, with coverage of more than 86% of US households, the company said. It expects the majority of its existing customers will shift over to the delivery service, according to Bloomberg. Tom Ward, Walmart’s chief e-commerce officer, told Bloomberg the company is “aware of the wider landscape.” Walmart will be able to leverage its fast delivery times and large network of stores with the new prescription service, Ward said. Walmart said the delivery option is a response to customer demand. More than half of Walmart customers expressed a desire to have their prescriptions delivered along with their groceries in a single online order, according to a recent Walmart survey. The discount chain has been able to attract inflation-battered customers. Walmart shares are up 53.5% so far this year. Meanwhile, traditional pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens are struggling to stay afloat. CVS shares are down 29.6% so far this year, and Walgreens shares are down 63.5% in the same period. Consumers have pulled back on spending due to high prices and long-lasting inflation. Low spending coupled with competition from Amazon and big-box retailers has hampered CVS’ and Walgreens’ business. Both companies have taken steps to cut costs. CVS ousted its CEO, Karen Lynch, and replaced her with David Joyner this week as it faces growing pressure from activist investors. The pharmacy chain unveiled plans to cut $2 billion in expenses over several years, including layoffs across its corporate sector affecting about 1% of its workforce, or 2,900 jobs. CVS is also close to completing its three-year plan to shutter 900 stores. The company has closed 851 locations as of August. Last week, Walgreens said it will close about 1,200 stores over the next three years – including 500 in the next fiscal year alone. Advertisement

Title: Huawei may have tried to skirt chip export controls, TSMC tells authorities

An advanced chip manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was reportedly found in sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei’s latest artificial intelligence chips. Research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s cutting-edge AI accelerator and found an Ascend 910B chip made by TSMC (TSM), Reuters and Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Canadian research firm told TSMC about its findings, prompting the Taiwanese chipmaker to inform the U.S. government about Huawei’s possible violation of U.S. export controls, Reuters reported. The Chinese tech company said it hasn’t “produced any chips via TSMC after the implementation of the amendments made by the US Department of Commerce to its FDPR that target Huawei in 2020,” in a statement shared with Bloomberg. The rule does not allow the export of any good to any country if it is manufactured with a certain percentage of U.S. intellectual property components. Huawei added that it “has never launched the 910B chip.” TSMC also informed the U.S. government about a potential attempt by Huawei to have it make AI chips for the company, the Financial Times reported. The Taiwanese chipmaker said in a statement shared with Quartz that it “proactively communicated with the U.S. commerce department regarding” a report by The Information last week that it was under investigation for making AI or smartphone chips for Huawei, which would be a violation of U.S. export controls. “We are not aware of TSMC being the subject of any investigation at this time,” TSMC said in the statement, adding that it “is a law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” The chipmaker said it has not supplied chips to Huawei “since mid-September 2020.” “If we have any reason to believe there are potential issues, we will take prompt action to ensure compliance, including conducting investigations and proactively communicating with relevant parties including customers and regulatory authorities,” TSMC said in the statement. Neither Huawei nor the Department of Commerce responded to a request for comment from Quartz. TSMC informed the Commerce Department about a customer placing orders for a chip resembling the Ascend 910B processor developed by Huawei, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. After seeing the order, a person close to TSMC told the Financial Times that the company also spoke to the customer related to the order, and that any investigation would be “related to” the Taiwanese chipmaker, but that it wouldn’t be the focus. The chipmaker reportedly made the precursor to Huawei’s chip before U.S. sanctions were placed on the Chinese tech company. A Commerce Department spokesperson told the Financial Times that its Bureau of Industry and Security is aware of The Information’s report, and that it “cannot comment on whether any investigation is ongoing.” Officials from the BIS met with TSMC leaders earlier this month about issues with its supply chain, Bloomberg reported, including over if third-party distributors could allow China access to restricted technology. TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares were down around 1.5% during mid-day trading on Tuesday. This story has been updated with additional information and a statement from TSMC.

Title: Why Ford Stock Is Not a Confident Pre-Earnings Pick

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. If you buy a stock before an earnings event, the risk is elevated, and you need to be confident about the company’s growth trajectory. As it turns out, Ford Motor (F) is about to report its earnings data. As a cautious investor, I am bearish on Ford stock because the company’s already-released sales data raises concerns. Ford Motor is an automotive giant that sells both conventional and electric vehicles. The company pays a decent dividend and, as we’ll discover, Ford shares appear to be bargain-priced. On the other hand, it’s not a great idea to jump on a stock just because a company has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) and offers a big dividend. It’s just as important for an automaker to demonstrate sales growth, and in that regard, Ford’s gears are stuck in reverse. You’ve heard about value traps, and maybe you’ve heard of yield traps. Could Ford fit into both of these categories? It’s entirely possible, so let’s delve into Ford’s details and see if there’s a value-and-yield trap with F stock. Ford has a non-GAAP trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 6.77x, which is certainly lower than the sector median P/E ratio of 14.98x. Furthermore, offers a forward annual dividend yield of 7.05%, which seems more favorable than the Consumer Cyclical Sector Average dividend yield of around 1%. Don’t jump to any conclusions, though. It’s possible for a company to have a very low P/E ratio and a very high dividend yield, like Ford does, if the share price drops sharply. It wasn’t too long ago when F stock plummeted from $14.50 to $11. Rapid, steep stock-price collapses can create distortions in P/E ratios and dividend yields, so don’t enter into any hasty trades with Ford stock right now. Quarterly financial reports can cause a stock to rally or tank. Nevertheless, some risk-takers will grab shares of Ford stock today, even though the company is set to disclose its third-quarter 2024 financial results on October 28, which is coming up very soon. So, there’s already reason to feel neutral about Ford stock right now. Yet, I’m actually feeling a little bit bearish about F stock before the company’s earnings event, and there’s a specific reason for this. I don’t have a crystal ball, but we all can look at Ford’s third-quarter 2024 vehicle sales numbers before the automaker’s financial results are to be released. Specifically, Ford sold 504,039 units versus 500,504 units in the year-earlier quarter, and that only represents a 0.7% year-over-year increase. In contrast, Ford demonstrated 7.7% year-on-year vehicle sales growth in the third quarter of 2023. Ford isn’t the only Detroit-based automaker showing an alarming sales trajectory, as Stellantis (STLA) recently posted a 20% decline in U.S. quarterly sales. Evidently, concerns about vehicle affordability are dragging on Detroit-based automakers’ sales growth figures. So, ask yourself: Do I really need to take any unnecessary chances on F stock today? Moreover, there’s another sign that Ford’s having trouble under the hood. Specifically, Ford just announced its plans to reduce its subscription prices for the company’s BlueCruise hands-free driving technology. BlueCruise offers autonomous (hands-free) driving features, such as lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control. In fact, Ford expects to lower the prices for both its annual and monthly BlueCruise subscriptions. These will be steep price cuts, from $75 to $50 for the monthly subscription plan and from $800 to $495 for the annual plan. This surely isn’t a positive sign for Ford. Self-driving features are supposed to be front-page news nowadays, but Ford’s steep subscription price cuts indicate that BlueCruise isn’t a highly in-demand service. This adds to my bearish argument and causes me to wonder whether competitors like Tesla (TSLA) will command a strong lead over Ford in the market for self-driving technology services. On TipRanks, F stock comes in as a Moderate Buy based on five Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Ford Motor stock price target is $12.68, implying 15.64% upside potential. If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell Ford stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Michael Ward of Benchmark Co., with an average return of 11.88% per rating and a 50% success rate. See more F analyst ratings As you can see, analysts are only lukewarm about Ford Motor stock. Also, it’s apparent that Ford’s BlueCruise subscriptions aren’t selling like hotcakes. Additionally, with an earnings event coming up soon, Ford could disappoint investors as the automaker’s quarterly vehicle sales growth is slowing. In other words, Ford has issues to address, and investors don’t need to jump into what might be a value-and-yield trap. Instead, you can choose to wait until Ford’s third-quarter 2024 financial results to see if there are any major positive surprises. I’m not super-confident that this will happen, so as a cautious investor, I’m leaning slightly bearish on F stock and staying on the sidelines. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Americans are cutting down holiday spending, as more professionals feel the crunch of rising home ... [+] costs With the festive season just around the corner, many Americans are cutting down on spending for Christmas gifts. "U.S. shoppers say they're going to spend less on holiday gifts this year, which would deliver another blow to retailers that have struggled with waning demand," Bloomberg reported recently. "Spending intentions for gifts declined 3% from a year ago, according to a survey of more than 4,000 respondents by Deloitte." This is no doubt due to increased costs, especially those arising from housing and soaring interest rates. In addition, U.S. professionals have little job and career stability and are under the threat of job loss due to layoffs and budget cuts. They are also forced to look elsewhere for work due to RTO mandates, and this combination of factors places restrictions on how American professionals are spending (or saving) their hard-earned salary. When your income flow is tight, it certainly helps to have something extra on the side so you can quickly bolster your salary, purchase thoughtful gifts for your loved ones, and enjoy the holidays relatively stress-free while giving yourself a healthy financial kickstart to the new year.

Title: Walmart adds pharmacy to same-day delivery

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The retail giant said it’s responding to a top request from its customers. The option is now available in six states and will expand nationally. Meeting a top demand voiced by its customers, Walmart on Tuesday said it is expanding same-day delivery to include prescription medications. Eventually customers will be able to get prescriptions delivered within hours or as soon as 30 minutes. The option is now available in six states — Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin — with plans to expand to 49 by the end of January. Under this program, customers can include prescriptions, grocery items or both for delivery. Walmart+ members, who pay a $98 annual fee for a variety of benefits, will receive free pharmacy delivery, while non-Walmart+ members pay $9.95. With the two major drugstore retailers in the U.S. in turmoil, Walmart is expanding convenience for its pharmacy customers, augmenting delivery services that the retail giant says reach 86% of households in the country. “Our extensive footprint across the nation combined with our deep expertise in pharmacy uniquely positions us to make a profound impact in the communities we serve," Kevin Host, senior vice president of pharmacy at Walmart U.S., said in a statement. “We understand that health care is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s hyper-local. Each community has unique needs. This new offering allows us to continue serving customers while also giving more time back to our pharmacies for high-touch health services.” The move is a response to a survey of customers Walmart conducted a couple of years ago, which found that 55% would like prescriptions included in their grocery deliveries and other online orders; this was the top request of “Walmart customers who self-identified as time-sensitive, busy families,” the company said in a blog post. Meanwhile, both Walgreens and CVS Health are downsizing. In a move to tighten its grip on expenses further, Walgreens last week said it will close 1,200 stores in the next three years. The company said its retail operations were a drag on its Q4 and full year results. In recent weeks CVS, also in the throes of cost-cutting, confirmed plans to lay off 2,900 employees. Both Walgreens and CVS have also shaken up their leadership over the last several months, with the latter replacing its CEO just last week. Walmart is also scaling back some health care options, however, saying earlier this year that, due to high operational costs, it will end its telehealth services and shutter all 51 health centers. Even Amazon, which has entered the pharmacy and health care business in part through acquisitions, recently confirmed hundreds of layoffs in those areas.

Title: How To Prevent A Mass Exodus During Return To Office

How to Prevent a Mass Exodus During RTO Amazon's recent five-day return-to-office (RTO) mandate has sparked significant employee discontent. This mandate shows the tension between companies and employees at the moment. The situation at Amazon reflects a trend across corporate America, a situation that must be addressed if business leaders want to retain top talent in today's market. Back in 2023, Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy announced that his workers should return to the office for at least three days a week. Employees strongly resisted this at the time. Before workers had fully adjusted to the three-day mandate, Amazon tightened its RTO policy to five days a week. This has led to intense employee backlash and the potential for a massive exodus of talent. A memo from September 16 says Amazon will cut management layers and require employees to return to the office full-time. A recent survey done by Blind of 2,585 Amazon employees found that 73% of Amazon professionals are rethinking their jobs since the news broke. The survey goes on to note that 80% of employees knew a colleague considering leaving. The reason for considering a new role outside of Amazon is not far-fetched. The new RTO policy is less flexible, especially for parents and long-distance commuters. Amazon employees hope leaders will reconsider a policy effective in 2025, or they will quit. In December 2023, many Amazon Web Services workers resigned when the three-day RTO policy launched. With the updated five-day policy, we might see a spike in those numbers. Amazon's new policy shows the ongoing tension between leaders and employees today. Many organizations are still pushing for rigid RTO policies despite the discontent among the workforce. In fact, according to a survey done by Resume Builder in August, 87% of companies will have returned to office by 2025, with big companies like UPS, Boeing, and JPMorgan Chase leading the line. These larger organizations cite improved productivity, higher revenue, and a strong culture as drivers for RTO. But there's no clear data to track the effectiveness of these RTO policies. The new Amazon RTO policy has drawn criticism from employees. Some say the mandate was not done kindly or transparently. Some employees state they learned this new policy from a news article. When these things happen, workers lose trust in their leadership, and understandably so. The truth is Amazon’s in-office model has been in flux post-COVID. In fact, there have been cases of employees who were hired remotely in 2023 and are now being instructed to return to the office immediately. Fortune reports that most were promised work from home when they were hired, but now, they're forced to change their work-life balance to fit in or keep their jobs. On the other hand, it’s been reported that the RTO mandate has not been applied across all of Amazon’s subsidiaries. For example, Amazon's One Medical subsidiary will let employees work 3 days a week starting in October. This has caused more company-wide disputes. This new policy is creating friction not just with workers but also with global mandates, especially with the UK government's push for flexible working rights ahead of the holiday season. The UK government has actively promoted flexible work and argues remote work boosts performance and loyalty. In contrast, Amazon maintains that in-office work fosters better collaboration and innovation. For many employees, the return-to-office policies represent a substantial financial strain. A 2023 Owl Labs report found that full-time office workers now spend an average of $51 daily and $1,020 monthly to work full-time in the office, compared to $408 per month for hybrid workers. It's now more expensive to work from the office than in 2019. This does not include the time spent commuting to and from the office. Workers are skeptical of the motives behind RTO policies beyond the additional monetary cost. A MyPerfectResume study found that 77% of workers believe RTO policies give employers more control. 64% think their employers don't trust them to work from home. However, the real reasons may be more sinister. An emerging report says a quarter of VP and C-suite executives plan to use RTO mandates as a smokescreen to cut jobs and boost margins. Some industry observers have dubbed this strategy "back-channel layoffs." Additionally, corporate messaging says that RTO policies aim to boost collaboration and innovation. Yet, 22% of HR pros admit their firms lack the data to measure this. Without tracking, transparency, and KPIs, the consequences can be severe and directly impact a company's bottom line. For instance, 8 in 10 employers lost talent to return-to-office mandates, and the cost of replacing them is substantial. To avoid a mass exodus of employees like at Amazon, consider these strategies for a successful hybrid or flexible Return to Office (RTO) policy: Instead of implementing blanket mandates, engage your team in the decision-making process. This inclusive approach provides valuable insights. It also fosters a sense of ownership among employees. This increases their buy-in for the final policy. Conduct anonymous surveys or focus groups to understand individual circumstances and concerns. The pandemic has shifted employee priorities. Ford's global study found that 77% of employed individuals now value a balanced personal life over career advancement. Create flexible work options, like hybrid models or flexible hours. Balancing business needs with employee needs is a way to ensure both get met. As a leader, set clear benchmarks. Use tools to track productivity, collaboration, and employee satisfaction across work models. Consider metrics such as employee performance level, engagement scores, and retention rates, and use this data to refine your policies over time. With RTO costs rising, it's crucial to consider the financial impact on your team. Evaluate your compensation and benefits package holistically. Consider offering perks like commuter benefits, meal allowances, cost-of-living adjustments, and childcare or eldercare subsidies. Your leadership team's actions will set the tone for the entire organization. Ensure that company leaders adhere to the same RTO policies as other employees. Be visible and accessible in the office when you expect your team to be there. Publicly recognize teams and individuals who embody the company's new work culture. A survey of over 5,000 workers found that 95% say their emotional well-being impacts their productivity. Consider on-site counseling, local mental health provider partnerships, and mental health app subscriptions. Also, regular workshops on stress management, work-life balance, employee wellness, and self-leadership should be held. Train managers to recognize and support employees' mental health needs. Clear, consistent communication is key to successful policy implementation. Create a full communication plan for your RTO strategy. It should include: Q&A sessions to address concerns, anonymous feedback channels for input, and clear decision-making guidelines. Overwhelmingly, employees are experiencing distrust when it comes to the organizations they work for. Organizations are not handling their RTO policies in ways that keep in mind the fact that their employees are humans with other priorities and needs outside of the office. When delivering life-altering news to employees, it’s important to be transparent and holistic when considering how your organization treats its most vital resource: its people. One Community.

ERIC KIM Over the past four years, MicroStrategy (MSTR) has outperformed both Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) in terms of stock growth, largely due to its significant exposure to Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of their performance: • MicroStrategy (MSTR): The stock surged 1,067% between 2020 and 2024, driven by its aggressive Bitcoin holdings strategy, which has been the primary factor behind its explosive growth. • Nvidia (NVDA): Over the same period, Nvidia saw a remarkable 1,008% increase, bolstered by its leadership in AI and semiconductor technologies. • Apple (AAPL): Apple, while experiencing steady growth, has seen a much lower percentage increase compared to the others, around 322%, reflecting its more stable, less speculative growth trajectory. MSTR’s growth is more volatile and heavily tied to the cryptocurrency market, while Nvidia’s gains are due to technological advancements in AI, and Apple’s rise is grounded in its dominant position in consumer electronics and services.

Title: The U.S. will keep pressuring allies to restrict chip sales to China, ASML chief says

With U.S. restrictions on investing in artificial intelligence in China expected imminently, the head of a major Dutch chipmaking equipment company said he expects more pressure on U.S. allies to curb chip sales to China. Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML (ASML), said most of its business in China is focused “on mainstream semiconductors,” which “is very different from AI,” during the Bloomberg Tech Summit on Tuesday. China has been ASML’s largest market for the last five quarters, with nearly half of the Dutch company’s revenue for the second-quarter coming from sales to the country, Bloomberg reported. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Fouquet said. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” China-based Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) depend on ASML’s DUV lithography machines to make advanced chips. The country has been unable to build a similar version of ASML’s equipment, and China cannot buy ASML’s extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, machines, which are used to make the world’s most advanced chips used by companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). Existing U.S. restrictions on China are holding it “10 to 15 years behind when it comes to advanced technology,” Fouquet said. In September, the Netherlands announced new export control rules requiring ASML to apply for export licenses with the Hague instead of with the U.S. to sell some of its equipment to China. Shares of ASML fell 16% last week after it published financial results early that showed a downward revision of guidance for 2025. “While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” Fouquet said in the company’s earnings report. “It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.” However, Fouquet told Bloomberg he expects both the chip industry and ASML to continue growing next year. “We also expect 2026 to be a growth year,” he said, “but it’s too early to quantify that.” Meanwhile, the U.S. government is in the final review stage for restrictions on outbound U.S. investments in sensitive technologies such as AI, semiconductors, and quantum computing to China, according to a government update. The final rules are expected to be released in the next week or weeks, Reuters reported. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: What’s up with… Lumen & Meta, Veon, JTower

Time Published: 2024-10-22T15:00:03Z

Oct 22, 2024 In today’s industry news roundup: US operator Lumen continues its datacentre interconnect-driven renaissance with a major contract from Meta; Veon responds to activist investor calls for a more aggressive strategy; DigitalBridge has successfully acquired a majority stake in Japan’s JTower and will take it private; and much more! Ashley Haynes-Gaspar, chief revenue officer at US network operator Lumen Technologies, didn’t hold back on his assessment of a deal the company has struck with Meta. “We’re enabling one of the biggest expansions of network capacity in our lifetime,” he said. No financial details were disclosed but Lumen, already riding on the wave of AI-fuelled demand for extra network capacity, says it’s going to provide “dedicated interconnection” – using its fibre-based ‘private connectivity fabric’ – for Meta’s infrastructure. “We’ve transformed our company to meet this demand,” enthused Haynes-Gaspar. “As Meta’s customers use more AI services across its platforms, we’re helping provide Meta with a seamless, effortless, and flexible network that will meet its growing needs.” Alex-Handrah Aimé, director of Meta’s network investments, seemed equally ebullient about the Lumen hook-up. “Our AI tools are performing increasingly more complex tasks, including enabling conversations in a variety of languages and translating text to images in real time, while helping people interact with the world around them in new, immersive ways,” she said. The Meta deal follows on from Lumen’s recent announcement that it had secured $5bn in new business deals to help it address the major demand for connectivity fuelled by AI. The company explained that large companies are looking to expand their fibre capacity as it becomes “increasingly valuable and potentially limited” due to “booming AI needs”. One of these deals includes a recent collaboration with Microsoft that will see Lumen act as a “strategic supplier” for the tech giant’s network infrastructure needs driven by AI developments. International network operator Veon has swiftly responded to the letter sent to its board by activist investor Shah Capital (holding a 7% stake), which called for multiple courses of action to improve the operator’s valuation and shareholder returns (see Monday’s news roundup for Shah Capital’s shopping list of demands). Veon’s management conceded in this published response that its disgruntled shareholder might have a point: “While Veon’s share value has more than doubled over the past two years, the company also shares Shah Capital’s assessment that its current share price indicates a potential for further improvement, as Veon positions itself as a leading opportunity for investors seeking growth in frontier markets.” At the same time, though, it says it is already doing much of what Shah Capital is demanding, such as considering local or regional initial public offerings (IPOs) for some units and engaging more forcefully with investors and financial analysts (albeit without much in the way of concrete results as yet…). Veon noted that it continues to “execute its strategic initiatives, including advancing its strong operating outlook, optimising its capital structure, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation.” That’s not going to cut it for the Shah Capital team, though, which is also demanding share buybacks and dividends to help boost Veon’s valuation and make it a more attractive investment. “We are carefully considering the recommendations in the Shah Letter, which include suggestions on capital returns, improving market valuation, leveraging Veon’s strengths in emerging markets and further enhancing communication with the investment community,” noted Veon – so certainly no hint of any immediate share buyback plans. Veon’s third-quarter results are due to be published and discussed on 13 November – that could make for an interesting investor call. Veon’s share price dipped by almost 1.7% to $30.38 on the Nasdaq exchange in early trading on Tuesday and that certainly won’t appease any of Veon’s shareholders. DigitalBridge has successfully acquired a majority stake in Japanese towers firm JTower and will now move to take the company private. DigitalBridge announced its intention to acquire JTower in August after several large shareholders agreed to sell their stakes once it became clear that it was proving hard to raise additional external investment because of the long return on investment cycle in the business. DigitalBridge has managed to acquire a 75.62% controlling interest in JTower for 70.1bn yen ($465m): It now plans to delist JTower from the Tokyo stock exchange and take it private, with DigitalBridge and Cultive, an asset management company of JTower’s representative director Atsushi Tanaka, the only shareholders. JTower, which counts all of Japan’s main mobile operators as users of its shared infrastructure, operates 589 shared in-building systems (IBSs) in Japan, as well as 243 in other countries, and more than 6,700 outdoor towers in Japan. Justin Chang, senior managing director and head of Asia at DigitalBridge, stated: “We are excited to solidify our investment in JTower, a leading player in Japan’s digital infrastructure sector. This strategic investment underscores our confidence in JTower’s long-term potential and its critical role in advancing next-generation digital networks. We look forward to collaborating with the JTower team to accelerate their growth, expand their presence, and drive enhanced connectivity throughout Japan, while continuing to serve the strategic and operational needs of customers.” ZTE has posted a subdued set of Q3 2024 financials. Operating revenue, at 27.6bn yuan (CNY) ($3.9bn), fell by nearly 4% compared with the same period last year. Net cash flow plummeted by an alarming 63% over the same period, to a shade over CNY 1bn ($140m). This vitally important financial metric looks a bit more stable, however, when viewed from the longer timeframe of the first nine months of 2024 (falling 10.1% year-on-year to CNY 8.05bn). Detailed commentary on the vendor’s performance during the quarter proved elusive, although a brief press release covering the first nine months cited progress in its international markets, where the Chinese vendor “continued to make breakthroughs with major countries and key operators, maintaining double-digit growth”. It also referred, without a breakdown of figures, to “rapid growth” in the company’s consumer and government-enterprise businesses. What is clear is that ZTE continues to plough significant sums into R&D – CNY18.6bn ($2.6bn) during the first nine months of this year, which represents more than a fifth of revenue generated during that time. ZTE flagged 5G advanced, ‘full-stack intelligent computing’ and all-optical networks as key areas of innovation. What is also pretty clear is that ZTE is not doing nearly as well as high-flying rival Huawei, which racked up CNY 417.5bn ($58.6bn) in revenues during the first half of 2024 and a whopping year-on-year increase of 34.3%. Consolidation in the cybersecurity sector… Oxford, UK-based Sophos, which is backed by private equity giant Thoma Bravo, is acquiring Secureworks for $859m. “Sophos’ experience and reputation as a leading provider of managed security services and end-to-end security products, combined with Secureworks’ security operations expertise… is expected to further deliver complementary advanced MDR [managed detection and response] and XDR [extended detection and response] solutions for the benefit of their global customer bases. Together, they will help strengthen the resilience and security posture of global organisations of any size with a combination of security controls, AI, world-class threat intelligence, and two teams with decades of cybersecurity expertise,” noted Sophos in this announcement. Joe Levy, CEO of Sophos, said: “Secureworks offers an innovative, market-leading solution with their Taegis XDR platform. Combined with our security solutions and industry leadership in MDR, we will strengthen our collective position in the market and provide better outcomes for organisations of all sizes globally. Secureworks’ renowned expertise in cybersecurity perfectly aligns with our mission to protect businesses from cybercrime by delivering powerful and intuitive products and services.” Ericsson has struck 50 deals for its 5G charging system, of which 20 are using the system in their commercial day-to-day operations “to monetise 5G at scale”. In marking its customer milestone, Ericsson makes a key point about the importance of such systems, which are key to telco business processes. “While the charging functionality is a vital and important part of a CSP’s monetisation model, it is still part of a wider set of capabilities that work in concert to deliver revenue, manage costs and complexity and flex to adapt rapidly to changing demands and service creation needs. An adaptable 5G-ready charging system needs to support new charging trigger points as services and use cases evolve (including for internet of things [IoT]), manage lifecycles for mass IoT devices and huge numbers of individual subscriptions, manage multiparty charging involving hierarchies and charging ‘on behalf of’ arrangements as well as non-telco service charging, such as API monetisation use cases,” noted the vendor.

Title: The Dow drops 150 points as gold hits a record, and Treasury yields rise

Time Published: 2024-10-22T14:25:00Z

The Dow fell by 165 points on Tuesday morning as gold prices surged to another record high and interest rates continued to climb. Federal Reserve policymakers are considering a more moderate approach to future interest rate cuts, a shift that has dampened investor sentiment. The prospect of slower rate reductions suggests that the Fed remains cautious about balancing inflation control with economic growth, contributing to the broader market’s unease. Shortly after the market opened Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 165 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 shed 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Spot gold prices have surged past $2,700 an ounce, reaching a new record high of $2,733. This marks a significant milestone for the precious metal, which has gained more than 30% year-to-date, driven by heightened investor demand for safe-haven assets amid ongoing economic uncertainties and tension in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly climbed above 4.2%—its highest level since July—before pulling back slightly. The rise in bond yields reflects concerns over persistent inflation and the potential for further tightening by the Federal Reserve, which has kept pressure on equity markets. Several major companies are reporting earnings on Tuesday, including 3M (MMM), General Motors (GM), GE Aerospace (GE), and Verizon Communications (VZ), all of which drew significant attention from investors. Nvidia (NVDA), which hit another high on Monday, was down 0.6% Tuesday morning, while Tesla (TSLA), which reports earnings on Wednesday, was down 0.8%.

Title: The future of the S&P 500 has everyone divided
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/goldman-sachs-stock-returns-prediction-different-projections-inflation-bullish-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-22T13:22:40Z

Good morning! A Sam's Club with robots making pizza and no cash registers could be the new norm for the warehouse club. CEO Chris Nicholas spoke to BI about what he wants shopping "in the future" to feel like. In today's big story, Goldman Sachs thinks the past decade of big returns from the S&P 500 is coming to a close. What's on deck: But first, is this the end? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the economy; Goldman Sachs is projecting a hard landing for future stock returns. The bank's portfolio strategy research team forecasts the S&P 500 will see annualized returns of 3% over the next decade, writes BI's Filip De Mott. That'd be a sharp comedown for stock investors, who have enjoyed 13% in annualized returns for the major index over the past 10 years. Setting aside the market's recent strength, Goldman's forecast still isn't great. Annualized returns of 3% would put it in the 7th percentile of performance since 1930. Goldman's rationale for the pessimistic take includes two things even a rookie investor can appreciate: The market is overvalued AND too concentrated. Currently, the S&P 500 cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio is 38, well above the index's average of 22. And the usual suspects — tech giants like Nvidia and Meta — have done much of the heavy lifting in helping the S&P 500 to record highs. Not everyone agrees with Goldman's forecast. This very newsletter recently included commentary from experts who said the two-year-old bull market still had plenty of gas left in the tank. It seems the only industry consensus we have about stocks' future is there is no consensus. Case in point: Goldman is bullish on a short-term perspective, recently raising its year-end S&P 500 price target. BI's Matthew Fox has a rundown on predictions from the bulls, the bears, and those somewhere in the middle. UBS, for example, sees another big gain for the S&P 500 next year, writes BI's Jennifer Sor. The bank said a "no landing" for the US economy means the S&P 500 could rise roughly 13% from its current levels. Inflation would remain somewhat elevated in the scenario, but the bank still sees room for the Fed to cut rates, which is bullish for stocks. On the other side of the spectrum are JPMorgan, which has maintained its bearish outlook this year in the face of a surging market, and Stifel, which has predicted a massive market downturn in 2025. At the center of the debate sits artificial intelligence. Bears point to the tech as overinflating valuations with little to no evidence of it meaningfully driving revenue. Bulls say the hype is warranted, as the impact of AI is inevitable, like the rise of the internet. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

U.S. stock futures are lower as indexes step back from record highs and Treasury yields move higher; General Motors (GM) and GE Aerospace (GE) beat third-quarter earnings estimates; Nvidia (NVDA) is close to eclipsing Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization; and Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) shares are rising on a report an activist investor is urging the restaurant chain to break up. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are lower Tuesday, a day after major indexes closed mixed. Coming off a six-week winning streak and record closing highs on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 moved lower on Monday, while the Nasdaq gained ground. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have hit their highest levels since July as investors factor in slower expectations of interest-rate cuts. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.19% on Monday, an increase of 11 basis points, to deliver the biggest intraday rise since Oct. 4. Automaker General Motors (GM) beat analysts' expectations with its third-quarter earnings report Tuesday morning. The Cadillac and Chevrolet maker reported revenue of $48.76 billion, better than the consensus estimate of $45.02 billion from analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its profit of $3.06 billion topped projections of $2.59 billion. GM also raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance to $10.00 to $10.50, up from the prior guidance of $9.50 to $10.50. Shares of GM are about 1% lower in premarket trading. GE Aerospace (GE) delivered third-quarter earnings that were better than analysts' expectations as the company reported strong demand for its airplane engines and parts. The company's revenue of $9.84 billion was above the projection of $9.55 billion from analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its net income of $1.89 billion, or $1.56 per share, topped the projected $1.28 billion and $1.19. The aerospace manufacturer also also lifted its profit projections for full-year 2024, guiding adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to a range of $4.20 to $4.35, up from $3.95 to $4.20 previously. Still, shares are declining more than 5% in premarket trading as commercial engines revenue came in a bit short of expectations. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are inching higher in premarket trading after the chipmaker hit another all-time high on Monday of $143.71 as analysts continued to project upward momentum for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) products. Bank of America named Nvidia a "top AI pick" and moved the company's price target to $190 from $165. The rise puts Nvidia's market capitalization around $3.5 trillion as it gains on Apple (AAPL) to become the world's largest corporation. Apple's market capitalization is near $3.6 trillion and its shares are lower by 0.7% in premarket trading. Activist investor JCP Investment Management has taken a position in The Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and is urging the company to break up, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The Houston-based hedge fund took a 2% stake in Cheesecake Factory, the report said, and is urging executives at the company to spin off restaurant chains North Italia, Flower Child, and Culinary Dropout. Shares of Cheesecake Factory are rising nearly 4% in premarket trading.

Title: Predictions 2025: Will You Stall Or Soar By Embracing The Future Of Work?

James L. McQuivey, PhD, VP, Research Director As 2025 approaches, businesses stand at a critical crossroads: Will they soar to new heights by embracing the future of work or stall in the face of emerging challenges? The last few years have been a roller-coaster ride, with a turbulent ascent into a seemingly bright future of work only to take a deep dive into the icy waters of layoffs, burnout, and disillusionment. And just when many thought the bottom had dropped out, we’re seeing faint signs of recovery — a bounce that will either propel companies forward or drag them further down. The fate of your organization depends on how you handle the critical choices coming your way. Among our future of work predictions for 2025, we predict big risks and opportunities such as the following: Whether our predictions for 2025 come true for you is up to you. As we saw in 2024, even as the EX winter got colder, companies that zigged while the rest zagged emerged far ahead of their counterparts. We know one financial services company that has the highest employee satisfaction scores it has ever seen, despite the general chilly work climate, because it invested in employees and addressed organizational concerns. Conversely, we’re working with many firms — in media, consumer products, and more — who are dealing with stagnant work cultures, general distrust in executives, and lower confidence in organizational strategy due to letting EX slide for the past year. That’s why we say that the future of work doesn’t have to be your future of work. Whether you stall or soar is up to you. Read our full Predictions 2025: The Future Of Work report to get more detail about each of these predictions and read additional predictions. Set up a Forrester guidance session to discuss these predictions or plan out your 2025 future of work strategy.

Title: Nvidia Price Levels to Watch as Stock Hits Record High on AI Optimism

Shares of AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) are likely remain to remain the spotlight Tuesday after jumping to a new record high yesterday. The stock has nearly tripled since the start of the year, and most analysts believe there's further upside based on the company’s dominance of the AI chip market and insatiable demand for its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture. Analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha have a consensus price target on the shares of $154.19, up from $152.41 a week ago and representing 7% upside from Monday's closing price of $143.71. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s weekly chart and identify important price levels that other investors will likely be watching. After reaching a prior peak in mid-June, Nvidia shares traded within a symmetrical triangle before staging a decisive breakout above the pattern earlier this month. It’s also worth pointing out, that although trading volume remains below longer-term averages, the stock logged its highest share turnover last week since late September. From a momentum standpoint, the relative strength index (RSI) indicates bullish price action and gives a reading below overbought levels, suggesting the stock has ample room to move higher. Looking ahead, let’s forecast a price target for the stock’s current uptrend and also locate several important levels on Nvidia’s chart that could attract buying interest during retracements. To speculate where the stock’s current trend higher may be headed, we can use a bars pattern, a technique that studies earlier trends to forecast future directional moves. When applying the analysis to Nvidia’s chart, we’ll extract the trend higher from April to June and reposition it from the start of the stock’s current move higher in early September. Such a technique indicates a potential upside target of around $180, about 25% above Monday’s closing price. We selected this prior trend as it commenced with a gain of around 15% on the weekly chart, similar to how the stock’s current move higher started. During periods of weakness, investors should initially keep their eyes peeled on the $125 level, a location on the chart where the shares may encounter support near the symmetrical triangle pattern’s breakout area. A breakdown below this level could see the shares decline to around $97. Investors may view this region as a buying opportunity, given its proximity to the March peak and 50-week moving average. Finally, a bearish reversal in the stock may trigger a move down to the $76 level, where bargain hunters would likely look for entry points around the mid-April pullback low.

U.S. rules that will limit some American investing into sensitive technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) in China are imminent, with a U.S. government update in the last review stage. The final rules will be released in the "next week or so" following an Office of Management and Budget review, Reuters said. The rules follow an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023 limiting U.S. investing in China that could strengthen the Asian nation's military while weakening American national security. According to that order, the U.S. Department of the Treasury was considering barring investing into China's quantum information technologies and some advanced technologies like "semiconductors and microelectronics," and requiring notification for investment into AI. The proposals were put forward for public feedback last year. The U.S. imposed export controls on advanced semiconductor chips aimed at curbing China's access last year. Such curbs have already made it harder for American firms like Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) to sell AI chips to China.

Title: GE Aerospace Tops Q3 Estimates, Raises Profit Outlook

GE Aerospace (GE) fell 7% Tuesday morning as revenue in its commercial engines and services division fell short of analysts' expectations, even though its overall revenue and profit beat estimates. The engine and aerospace parts manufacturer posted $9.84 billion in total revenue, while analysts polled by Visible Alpha had a consensus estimate of $9.55 billion. Net income was $1.89 billion, or $1.56 per share, compared with the projected $1.28 billion and $1.19. However, GE Aerospace’s commercial engines and services revenue came in at $7.00 billion, below the $7.13 billion expectation. Revenue in the smaller defense and propulsion segment of $2.24 billion also missed estimates of $2.34 billion. The company lifted its profit projections for full-year 2024, guiding adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to a range of $4.20 to $4.35, up from $3.95 to $4.20 previously. "The GE Aerospace team delivered strong results, with demand driving orders up 28%," Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Larry Culp said. "We grew earnings 25% and produced substantial free cash flow, both largely driven by services. Given the strength of our results and 4Q expectations, we're raising our earnings and cash guidance for the year." In the weeks leading up to GE Aerospace's report, Bernstein analysts said the company faced a "key question"—the impact the Boeing (BA) machinists union strike would have on its operations. Slower production of Boeing planes would mean poorer engine sales, but would also improve the maintenance aftermarket for its existing engines. GE Aerospace didn't mention any impacts of the five-week Boeing strike in its earnings release, which could end soon after the sides came to a tentative agreement over the weekend that the union's members are set to vote on Wednesday. Analysts are the most bullish on GE Aerospace stock of the former General Electric segments, with all eight of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha maintaining a "buy" rating, compared to 11 of 13 for GE Vernova and six of 11 for GE HealthCare (GEHC). GE Aerospace also has a larger projected gain, with its average target price about 9% above its current levels, compared to just over 3% for GE Vernova and GE HealthCare. Despite today's decline, GE Aerospace shares still are up about 30% since the early April split from GE Vernova (GEV). UPDATE—This story has been updated with the latest share price and information about segment revenue.

Title: The case for a 'Magnificent 7' resurgence: Morning Brief

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The broadening of the stock market rally has become a crucial theme during the second half of 2024. Amid the start of rate cuts — and economic data that's showed the US economy remains in better shape than initially feared — the recent push to new record highs has largely been about companies not named Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), or Nvidia (NVDA). But the debate over whether the market's next leg higher will be led by just a few large tech companies — as was the case in 2023 and the early part of 2024 — continues to roll on among investors. In a note on Friday, data from FactSet showed that earnings for the 493 companies in the S&P 500 outside the "Magnificent Seven" are expected to grow by an average of more than 13% over the next five quarters. Conversely, the Magnificent Seven are expected to see earnings grow by an average of nearly 19% over the same time period. Notably, this represents a pickup in growth for the 493 from 2024 and a notch lower for the Magnificent Seven. This more positive trend in the 493 is one of the reasons strategists have called for a continued broadening out of the rally. But as our chart below shows, the difference in trend growth is a narrowing race. And some believe Big Tech could still be the winner. "The Mag 7 are still expected to post superior (and presumably more reliable) earnings growth than the rest of the index," DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said. Colas noted that this data suggests tech "should begin to play catchup into the end of the year," as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and throughout 2024. "Going forward, the path to outperformance will be assessing whether Big Tech or the rest of the S&P 500 will exhibit better earnings momentum," Colas wrote. "If one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet. Our own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech." Part of the tech revival may already be playing out. Nvidia has soared to a fresh record high over the past month, its first since June. Apple stock closed at a record high of $235 per share on Friday and added to those gains on Monday. Netflix (NFLX), the first of the large tech giants to report earnings, saw a massive rally in its stock to a fresh record high after another impressive round of earnings. That move in the streaming giant is perhaps the most illuminating when considering the case for Big Tech to lead the market. Even Netflix, which had already seen its stock rise more than 50% on the year before earnings, managed to surprise Wall Street to the upside. Perhaps this serves as an early reminder that while growth in tech is "expected" to slow from its rapid pace over the past year, that doesn't mean there can't be upside surprises — or that it still can't outperform. You don't need to look beyond the past 18 months of many tech earnings reports coming in better than expected for the empirical evidence. Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Gold's Recent Record Run May Be Tempting—What to Know Before Investing

Gold prices have been climbing steadily, reaching a series of record highs as investors have piled in amid uncertainties that could affect other markets. While gold could add shine to your portfolio, advisors caution against going all in. In September, U.S. investors poured a net $1.91 billion into gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to CFRA data. “It is important to note that while both gold commodity and equity ETFs flows have been negative overall in 2024, we have seen a turn in flows recently,” CFRA said in a recent research report. Meanwhile, gold bars have been flying off the virtual shelves at Costco Wholesale (COST) since last year. The company said gold and silver bullion was one of its top digital sales categories for the quarter that ended on Sept. 1. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge or a safe haven asset when investors worry about stocks. And this year, so far, has offered a number of reasons for investors to be concerned—uncertainty around a U.S. recession, when the Federal Reserve would begin cutting rates, the presidential election and geopolitical risks. Through the close of trading Monday, gold prices are up 32% since the start of the year, trading at around $2,700 an ounce, whereas the S&P 500—a broad barometer of U.S. stock markets—has returned 23%. Anytime an asset sees that kind of growth, investor interest surges, said Brandon Angotti, VP, Financial Planning & Trust Officer at the Wealth Group Union Savings Bank. "You just want to make sure you're very careful, so that you're not buying at the peak when everyone else is sort of chasing [it]," he said. Financial advisors recommend some amount of gold in your portfolio for the sake of diversification, but there are some factors you should keep in mind before investing. Clients should hold no more than 5% to 10% of their portfolios in an alternative investment like gold for diversification, according to Angotti. He also urges investors to read the fine print on tax rates. Gold ETFs, for example, can be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate of up to 28% as opposed to a maximum of 20% tax for equity ETFs. On top of that, said MaryAnne Gucciardi, a certified financial planner (CFP) at Wealthmind Financial Planning, if you own physical gold in the form of bars or jewelry, there is a cost of holding it safely. That could mean additional insurance costs, as well as dealer premiums you have to pay when purchasing or selling gold, Scott Van Den Berg, President of Century Management, recommends his clients have gold exposure of 6%-7% via bullion rather than through a gold ETF or an ETF that invests in gold mining stocks, to hedge against rising prices in the future. “While inflation has come down, we don’t think it’s going to stay down,” he said, adding he believes elevated government spending will stoke inflation again, which could make gold more appealing. David Flores Wilson, a managing partner at Sincerus Advisory, however, cautions investors to not make the mistake of believing that gold has intrinsic value and will continue to have intrinsic value. “Investors should be mindful that there have been recent periods of over 10 years where gold's return has been nearly flat prior to its run-up over the last year," Flores Wilson said. Wealthmind's Gucciardi also believes it's difficult to ascertain where the price of gold might be headed, especially in the near term. "For short-term investors, gold often comes down to timing the market, which is tricky and not based on research-backed strategies,” she said.

Title: A Strange Trip Through the Violence of the Trump Era

Time Published: 2024-10-22T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Emily Witt’s favorite drug is acid—specifically between 75 and 100 micrograms two or three hours before leaving the house. It never causes a hangover, it lasts all night, and its effects can be amplified or dulled down with other drugs. On the right amount of acid, Witt feels happy to be around others, but not so delirious that she might mistake someone she doesn’t know for a friend. LSD is also a fairly straightforward drug, hard to lace with other, more risky chemical compounds, and thus relatively safe for human consumption. Besides, “as a straight white girl from the Midwest, the archetype of the nerdy midwestern acid freak … was an established role I could comfortably inhabit.” Witt discloses this preference halfway through her new book, Health and Safety, a memoir about love, work, and Brooklyn’s rave scene in the 2010s. In 2012, after she went off the antidepressant she had been taking for many years, she quit her full-time job at a newspaper and became a freelance writer. She was at work on her book Future Sex, but was already preparing to investigate another kind of hedonism. Before turning 30, Witt had been tentative about trying recreational drugs, worried about how they might interact with her dose of Wellbutrin. But after she stopped taking the medication, she felt free to experiment. After smoking DMT for the first time with a friend, Witt became fascinated by the concept of altered consciousness. “That this cognitive experience could be generated by the interaction of my brain with a chemical found in plants amazed me,” she explains at the book’s outset. “That our biology enabled us to trip could not be an accident. I wanted to understand more.” At first, Health and Safety appears to be, like Future Sex, an entertaining, provocative, first-person reported book about the subcultures surrounding a recreational activity. Health and Safety is not quite the scientific and cultural history that Michael Pollan offered in How to Change Your Mind; nor is it as experimental as fellow raver McKenzie Wark’s Raving, an informal, sometimes diaristic book that explains what it feels like to stave off gender dysphoria by letting loose on the dance floor. Witt has written something more expansive, borrowing elements of both genres. It is both a researched history of drugs and electronic music and a firsthand account of consumption and escapism. But it’s also an exploration of how one squares extended periods of partying with an otherwise conventional adult life—with its commitments to long-term partnership and full-time work. While Witt’s work sometimes covers the culture of drugs and dancing, she has also reported on pressing social and political issues: school shootings, police brutality, the alt-right. That work turns Health and Safety into something much more complex than a meditation on dancing and drugs. Namely, it is a book concerned with how people express their political frustration; how they take it out on others, and how they channel it into their everyday lives and personal relationships. When Witt sets out on her drug journey, she doesn’t “understand the point of being on a psychedelic at a bar or a party.” At first, her experimentation isn’t about meeting people, or immersing herself in music. Only later does the research swallow her whole. Eventually, the end of the workday and the start of the night become indistinguishable, even if she is closing her laptop and sliding on her sneakers. After trying DMT, she samples everything she can get her hands on: ayahuasca, acid, MDMA, magic mushrooms, ketamine. She reads books about drugs, learns about appropriate dosages and interactions, attends drug conferences, and goes to Burning Man. (This last one is a two-for-one research project, as the festival is an oasis known both for tripping and “consent tents.”) The drugs, at first, aren’t about meeting people, but inevitably she does. At the first ayahuasca ceremony she goes to in upstate New York, she meets an attractive guy named Matt who is really into mushrooms and self-help. She dates him for a couple years despite never really liking him that much, and their relationship is fading when she meets someone who, for the book’s purposes, she calls Andrew: a raver who makes music and organizes his life around partying. She and Andrew do drugs together and go to parties together. They fall in love, and he introduces her to a whole new set of ravers who go out in Brooklyn, upstate, and Berlin to dance to techno and house D.J.s. “My world oriented itself like a compass toward a magnet,” she writes of Andrew. “Toward his tastes, his friends, the social scene I wanted to inhabit.” But where the story really starts to gain traction and where the book’s subhed—“a breakdown”—begins to make sense is when Witt’s work as a journalist moves to the forefront and the partying fades into the background. In 2018, she interviews for a job at The New Yorker and is sent to Parkland, Florida, to write about the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Trump is president, the culture wars are heating up, and increasingly, she is covering what can only be described as “the violence beat.” She travels back to her hometown of Minneapolis, where an anti-Muslim activist interrupts an Ilhan Omar campaign event with her screams. She attends a Trump rally in Houston where supporters carry AR-15s and tell her that immigrants are “flooding into America to loaf, steal, and sell fentanyl.” She goes to Kenosha, where Kyle Rittenhouse kills two protesters. She becomes immersed in dark stories that would keep any sane person up at night. Coming back to Andrew and her local joints in Bushwick allows her to “forget about America and its problems,” if only for a little while. These are the kinds of stories Witt is working on when Covid-19 hits Brooklyn, in the aftermath of the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, and the reignition of the Black Lives Matter movement across the country. The pandemic dramatically upends nightlife, taking away the community and outlet that ravers, Witt included, once had to blow off steam. D.J.s move into Zoom squares and stream their music on online platforms for fans, but “club music without the club was devoid of so much of its purpose.” The new slowness of life, however, also helps Witt come to the realization that her “most transcendent drug experiences were probably behind me” anyway. She thinks about leaving New York, and perhaps becoming a mother while she still can. Meanwhile, her work as a journalist is only becoming more important—and more frustrating to Andrew, who is depressed, disengaged, stung by the loss of his lifeline, and also a little resentful of Witt’s career. Journalists, he comments, “made their names by piggybacking on acts of violence and injustice.” It’s with this attitude that Andrew grudgingly joins Witt at a Black Lives Matter protest in the Bronx, where he is beaten up and eventually taken into custody by the cops. Witt, in a fit of panic, escapes the violence with her press pass. Everything goes downhill from here. Andrew is jolted into action after getting released from jail with minor injuries. He becomes fixated on the way that cops violated him. He starts researching policing strategies and decides he wants to order protective gear from Amazon. He has what turns out to be a manic break, and his resentment blooms into anger. As their relationship slowly falls apart, Andrew harasses her with text messages, reveals details about other women he’s slept with (they had an open relationship), threatens to change the locks on their apartment, calls her “a Karen” and “a cop,” and pees on the couch in her office. At one point, he becomes convinced that anyone who thinks he needs help—friends in their circle, his own mother—only thinks as much because Witt told them lies. He takes on a reactionary mode Witt describes as “a Trumpian logic.” All the while, she is trying to report on City Council meetings in New York and protests in Louisville. Adrenaline accumulates in this part of the book, as one begins to feel the nearly visceral way that violence comes to define Witt’s life at this moment, the dynamics of her relationship refracting the angry and emotional political climate. “The stagnation of the previous month,” she writes, “had been replaced by a new, vicious energy, and righteous political anger that I could not seem to sufficiently meet or respond to.” The sentence describes Andrew’s behavior after he is released from jail, but it could just as well characterize that peculiar moment in history, when social isolation, layoffs, and deaths from disease and political violence fed emotions and reactions at a rate too fast to appropriately calibrate in real time. On Twitter, Trump called Covid the “Chinese virus,” and his supporters followed with even worse slurs; in St. Louis, Patricia and Mark McCloskey pointed guns at protesters; and in Minneapolis, an anti-government collective called Unicorn Riot burned down the Third Precinct of the city’s police department. Trump and his supporters had primed the country perfectly for this zenith of anger, Witt suggests through the patterns of her own reporting. “I was writing the same story over and over; and recent history was mutating and becoming recombinant,” she writes. Kyle Rittenhouse replayed the vigilante violence of George Zimmerman, while the internet fostered a supercharged combination of Alex Jones and the homophobic hate group Westboro Baptist Church. In narrating Andrew’s descent into rage, Witt startingly captures the mood of the Covid years: a period when many took part in a mass competition to see who could be the most righteously outraged, each performing in a global morality pageant. “He spoke not with his own words but in the borrowed language of racism and trauma,” she writes of Andrew after he is released from jail and crowned with a newfound martyrdom. “Which in that time was the most unassailable language a person could deploy.” Andrew is frustrated by the system and his claustrophobia. Without a way to vent those feelings, Witt, with her “elite media job,” becomes a target. “Discarding me, had become, for him, an act of ideological purity,” she writes. “He had cast me as a stand-in for the failure of liberalism.” Andrew’s angry words get into her head, and force her to question her own conception of herself: “I was left to convince myself of the integrity of my politics, which I was incapable of doing, because of course I was culpable.” Andrew’s comments about her opportunism felt at points too obvious to be worth her energy. But, she allows, he “had national opinion on his side.” The conundrum raises the question of what we owe, as writers, to people when we are reporting on violence—physical, emotional, or otherwise. Is what journalists do in fact, as Janet Malcolm famously proposed, “morally indefensible”? Or, as Andrew seems to indicate, is a reporter just “ideal terrain” for “misguided virtue signaling”? The answer is not exactly clear, and finding it is not really Witt’s goal, either. For, after all, Health and Safety does not attempt to define stability, health, or safety. Rather the book is about striving for all those states of being in a tumultuous, difficult, and violent period. Dancing on drugs for 15 hours at a time may seem to some an irresponsible way to deal with reality. But when you revisit those unpredictable and dangerous moments of lockdown, the nightlife scene starts to look like one of the few places that still made sense.

Title: Why sticking to a rigid product roadmap might be killing your product, and how to escape?
URL: https://www.mindtheproduct.com/why-sticking-to-a-rigid-product-roadmap-might-be-killing-your-product-and-how-to-escape/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T07:00:00Z
Full Content:
In this article, Sapnil Bhatnagar, a technical product manager, shares his approach when developing a product roadmap and his own FLEX Roadmap Model. Sapnil is a Technical Product Manager specializing in Digital AI SaaS products, based in London, UK. With deep expertise in product strategy development, product vision and implementation through agile methodologies. Product development is evolutionary! New prioritization frameworks popping up every week, a new competitor feature that just launched, or an idea generated during your sweet nap time can hamper your ability to stick to a roadmap which was well crafted 6 months ago. To plan an escape from this vicious cycle and engage in re-prioritization we product managers can sometimes become too rigid with our product roadmaps, even becoming a cause of our own misery. Product roadmaps are often seen as the holy grail of planning and execution. They provide a sense of direction, help align teams, and give stakeholders a clear view of what's coming next. They serve as a guiding light for executive leaderships to manage and develop forecasts on resourcing and fill the funding winter if it comes! However, when product managers cling too tightly to these roadmaps, they risk stifling innovation, missing market opportunities, and ultimately, killing their product. This article explores why flexibility in product planning is crucial and presents a framework for striking the right balance between structure and adaptability. It's easy to understand why we product managers might be tempted to stick religiously to our roadmaps: However, in my experience, this rigidity comes at a significant cost. Let's examine the four key issues with rigid product roadmaps: Markets evolve rapidly. New competitors emerge, customer preferences shift, and technologies advance. A rigid roadmap can blind you to these changes, causing you to build features that may have been relevant when you planned them but are obsolete by the time they're released. During the course of my existing engagement in running a B2B product development, there was a radical shift in compliance requirements from the regulatory agencies, leading to accommodation of a critical reporting feature, if not done, it would have led to a big compliance risk. I acknowledged that if the product roadmap was not pivoted to cater to these immediate needs we may be looking at huge fines in a year’s time. Regulatory situations cannot always be forecasted; hence Product Managers are required to instrument their roadmap plan to accommodate uncertainties. Industry case study: Meta's horizon worlds (2022-2023) Meta (formerly Facebook) heavily invested in the metaverse (Zuckerberg’s new gig), particularly its virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, believing it to be the next big tech frontier, However, the market was misread, the product failed to align with current market demand and user expectations. Outcome: When teams are too focused on delivering pre-planned features, they may miss opportunities for creative problem-solving or breakthrough ideas that could dramatically improve the product. Innovation often comes from unexpected places, and rigid roadmaps leave little room for exploration. Though, being careful with innovation to not hamper the time to release is also important, it’s all about striking the right balance! Industry Case Study: Intel's Chip manufacturing delays (2022-2023) Intel, once a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, fell behind competitors due to delays in developing new chip technologies, Internal bureaucracy and a focus on existing technologies stifled innovation in advanced chip manufacturing processes. Outcome: Sticking to outdated plans means investing time and money into features that may not provide value. This inefficiency can be costly, especially for start-ups and small companies with limited resources. Case in point was my time at leading product development for a ML and data science augmentation project, where resources were being trained on-the-job, hence, sticking to training plans which were relevant to feature developments which were discovered and deemed relevant six months ago were no longer relevant and may even interject with productivity if followed. Industry case study: Amazon's Alexa division (2022) Amazon heavily invested in its Alexa voice assistant technology, believing it would drive significant revenue through voice shopping and other services, Though, the division struggled to monetize per projections leading to layoffs in the space. Despite having over 100 million Alexa-enabled devices sold, only a small percentage of users made purchases through voice commands Outcome: Talented product developers and engineers thrive on solving real problems. If they're forced to work on features they know are no longer relevant or valuable, it can lead to frustration and decreased motivation. Everyone likes to be creative at times, if the creative space is taken out of the metric, demotivation sulks in faster than expected! Industry case study: Twitter's mass layoffs and policy changes (2022-2023) Following Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, the company underwent dramatic changes in leadership, policies, and workforce, with rapid policy shifts, mass layoffs, and public disputes in play, employee motivation went to an all time low, with flurry of organic and inorganic attrition. Outcome: To address these issues and implement solutions which can deliver quick fast and can scale, Over the years I developed my own FLEX Roadmap Model: F - Focus on outcomes L - Learn continuously E - Experiment rapidly X - X-ray vision (transparency) Let's explore each component of this model and how it can be implemented: Instead of detailing specific features months in advance, organize your roadmap around themes or high-level objectives. This approach provides direction while allowing flexibility in how you achieve your goals. The solution will become easier if you as a product manager can take proactive steps in coaching your leadership teams on Rolling-Wave planning. High level focus areas: Implementation: 1.1 Develop a high level view on product strategy 1.2 Compartmentalize your product strategy into product focus areas 1.3 Break product focus areas into product features 2.1 Proceed with Rolling wave planning as ideas on product features become clear 2.2 Start execution through ‘Feature driven development’ At some point we have all been hostages to a stringent deadline, immediate needs of accommodating priority and dry Microsoft Project Plans, dreading to update those plans and convincing executives on why the updates are not clearly documented can be taxing! Here, agile comes to your rescue! (Agile by design advocates continuous improvements and continuous feedback loops, Agile also promotes failing early, your Definition of Done can change and evolve, hence, keep making changes to your DoD as your product development continues and expands and you collect more and more feedback) Hence, as a product manager your starting point should be to create formal channels for collecting and analyzing customer feedback and enabling a smooth window to augment those feedbacks into your development, once you can achieve this, you will have a solid reasoning for ‘Why the plan needs to change?’ Always, make it a priority to incorporate customer input into your roadmap decisions and share the roadmaps as frequently as possible; Even better, set up a fortnightly, roadmap review call to maintain transparency, it has always worked flawlessly in my case, and there’s no reasoning why it shouldn’t work for yours! High level focus areas: Implementation: 3.1 Establish full scale Agile framework on your product delivery by advocating 3.2 Setup an achievable definition of done early on to avoid last minute surprises 4.1 Use metrics and dashboards to validate your product decisions focussing majorly on feature importance, feature touchpoints. 4.2 Ensure to develop these metrics in collaboration with your customers and product teams to capture the most accurate results. Intelligent fact: Do you know only 6% of the product features are actually ever used regularly by your customers as part of their customer journey? While sticking to pre-defined agenda and objectives is necessary, most value is created when teams experiment and fail. As a product manager I have always encouraged my team to run small experiments and develop alternate prototypes. Building a reward structure and healthy competition can lead to exceptional results, experimentation also helps validate assumptions before committing significant resources to a feature. (Try using Six Thinking Hats and 5 Whys concept to assess right experimentation and driving clarity) High level focus areas: Implementation: 5.1 Allocate specific time (~10%) in each sprint for your team to collectively brainstorm on ideas and refine generated ideas 5.2 Enable idea plotting to capture themes and pick top three ideas for implementation in subsequent delivery 6.1 Validate the implemented ideas through release in a small subset, thus enabling consumer experimentation 6.2 Swiftly discard unused ideas (features) which do not pull in positive outcomes (financial/user experience) within first 60 days I think 70% of the product manager’s job revolves around driving clarity, fostering clarity amidst uncertain and ambiguous environments is a mountain in itself. When the objective is unclear and ideas are floating all over the place, bringing in a structure and a ‘How to’ guide makes a huge impact! When you do need to adjust the roadmap, be transparent about the reasons with your team, drive transparency through guidelines by pointing towards the incremental value and enable collaborative sessions! (MIRO works best here) This will help stakeholders understand the value of flexibility, eventually augmenting your roadmap with achievable product's overall goals. High Level Focus Areas: Implementation: Step 7.1: Use custom or standard templates to conduct monthly product performance review focussing on user base and financial metrics Step 7.2: Close changes and document release notes formally month on month Release your product roadmaps in your product circle and consumer base enabling positive user experience and product acceptance It's important to note that abandoning structure entirely is not the answer. The key is to find a balance between providing direction and maintaining flexibility. While roadmaps are valuable tools for product development, they should be viewed as living documents rather than inflexible mandates. By embracing the FLEX Roadmap Model you're not just saving your product – you're setting it up to thrive in an ever-changing market landscape. Remember, the most successful products are often those that can adapt quickly to change. By loosening your grip on rigid roadmaps and implementing a more agile approach to product planning, you ensure that your product remains relevant, competitive, and truly valuable to your customers.

Title: Oklo Stock Price Levels to Watch as Nuclear Energy Startup Surges 22% to Record High

Time Published: 2024-10-22T02:06:41Z
Full Content:
Shares in Oklo (OKLO) are likely to remain on watchlists after soaring to a new record high Monday as investors continue piling into the Sam Altman-backed Nuclear energy startup. The stock has more than doubled over the past month on growing consensus among analysts that nuclear energy-related companies will benefit from big tech hyperscalers turning to the energy source to power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The stock gained 22% on Monday to close at $22.31. In September, Microsoft (MSFT) announced a 20-year deal to provide nuclear power for the tech giant's data centers, while Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have also recently signed nuclear deals to meet their growing energy requirements. Below, we take a closer look at Oklo’s chart and use technical analysis to point out several key price levels to watch out for. Since breaking out from a falling wedge on above-average volume last month, Oklo's stock has trended sharply higher. Moreover, share turnover has surged in recent trading sessions, indicating strong buying conviction behind the bullish move. The relative strength index (RSI) confirms positive price momentum with a reading above 80, though the indicator also warns of extremely overbought conditions that could lead to near-term declines in the stock. Let’s look at a potential upside price target and identify three key support levels that could come into play during periods of profit taking. We can forecast a bullish price target by using a bars pattern, a technique that analyzes prior trends on the chart to project future moves. In this case, we’ll extract Oklo’s trending period from September to October and overlay that move from prior peaks in the stock around $16. The analysis, which forecasts a target of around $35, assumes the stock may be in the process of following a basic Elliot Wave pattern with five distinct swings playing out. During an initial pullback, investors should keep an eye on the $16 level mentioned above. This area on the chart sits well positioned to find support near a horizontal line connecting a range of comparable trading levels between April and October. A close below this level could see the shares retrace to around $12.25, where they may attract buying interest near several peaks and troughs that formed on the chart throughout April and May. A deeper fall may lead to a retest of lower support near the $9.50 area, a location just below the 200-day moving average where bargain hunters could look for buying opportunities around a period of July consolidation and this month’s retracement low.

Read more We initiate coverage on Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) with REDUCE (TP of Rs1,750, at ~23x core Sep-26E PER, similar to MSIL) amid a lackluster ~5% EPS CAGR over FY24-27E. HMIL has established a strong franchise in India; however, lack of major launches (key growth driver historically in PVs) over the next 12-18M, muted ~5% capacity CAGR, higher royalty, and lower treasury income are likely to restrict EPS growth. While MSIL (REDUCE) also faces similar near-term growth challenges, we prefer it over HMIL given its catch-up on operational and financial metrics (even on lower SUV mix) with a much diversified product and powertrain mix and a higher growth optionality (potential small-car recovery, aggressive 8% capacity CAGR, 7-seater SUV launch in H2FY26E, and 10 new models by 2030) driving a superior 6%/10% revenue/EPS CAGR over FY24-27E. Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) shares listed at ₹1,934 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) today, marking a discount of 1.3 per cent to its issue price of ₹1,960. The stock further declined to ₹1,923.25 in early trading, down 0.56 per cent from its opening price. On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the shares opened at ₹1,931.00. The ₹27,870 crore initial public offering (IPO), the largest in India’s history, had received a lukewarm response during its three-day subscription period. The issue was undersubscribed at 0.45 times overall, with only the employee portion showing strong interest at 1.43 times subscription. Read more pic1.jpg Hyundai Motor India Limited’s IPO listed at ₹1,934, marking a 1.33% loss against its issue price of ₹1,960, which was largely in line with expectations. The IPO witnessed a moderate subscription, with an overall bid of 2.3 times. The subdued grey market premium (GMP) of ₹67 (3.42%) ahead of listing had already indicated limited enthusiasm for listing gains, and the company’s fully priced valuation contributed to the muted debut. Despite the discounted listing, Hyundai Motor India’s strong fundamentals, being the second-largest passenger vehicle manufacturer in India and its strategic focus on the SUV segment, continue to support its long-term growth prospects. Investors who entered with a long-term perspective may consider holding the stock, as future performance will likely be driven by the company’s competitive market position and product innovations.
