Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is demanding employees come into the office five days a week, but it’s not because he secretly wants them to quit, he said. Jassy announced the company’s strict return-to-office mandate in a September memo, sparking immediate outrage from employees, some of which had been working at least two days remotely per week since May 2023. Some experts have theorized that Jassy’s RTO plan could be a sneaky way of reducing the company’s headcount, rather than go through the formal process of conducting layoffs. Yet, in an all-hands meeting Tuesday, Jassy denied claims that the RTO plan was a “backdoor layoff” or that the company had reached some agreement with city leaders. “I can tell you both of those are not true. You know, this was not a cost play for us. This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture,” he said, according to a transcript reported by Reuters. Following the September RTO announcement, 73% of employees surveyed by anonymous job review site Blind said they had considered quitting in light of the new policy. Other employees quickly took to LinkedIn to change their status to #opentowork in hopes of finding a more flexible position. But in the company’s Amazon Web Services unit, CEO Matt Garman was clear that the naysayers could go elsewhere. “If there are people who just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around,” Garman said on an internal call last month, referencing the company’s RTO policy, Reuters reported. To make clear their frustration with the RTO policy, hundreds of AWS employees signed a letter last month protesting the change, calling it an “outright abdication” of AWS’s role as an innovator and industry leader. To be sure, Amazon has offered employees commuter benefits and subsidized parking, among other perks to help ease the transition. In the memo from September, Jassy said it’s easier for employees to learn and collaborate while in person. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Amazon told Fortune the RTO plan is meant to strengthen the company’s culture and ensure teams are connected. The RTO memo asked workers to go back to “the way we were before the onset of COVID,” and banned working from home except for extraordinary circumstances. Jassy pointed out in the memo that intense coding work or having a sick child were appropriate times to work from home with manager consent. While managers earlier this year received approval to fire employees who didn’t comply with the previous three-day in-office mandate, many still made changes to their lives based on Amazon’s flexibility. In the Tuesday all-hands meeting, Jasssy acknowledged the five-day RTO policy, which takes effect in January, would take some getting used to. “It is an adjustment. I understand that for a lot of people, and we’re going to be working through that adjustment together,” Jassy said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Trump win sparks big rally in stocks

Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs in anticipation of Trump’s pro-business approach. Donald Trump’s return as president of the United States for the second time has boosted equity markets on bets of lower corporate tax, favourable tariffs and deregulation, lifting shares of banks, locally focused small-cap companies and Trump Media. His promise to make Tesla CEO Elon Musk head of a government efficiency commission after the billionaire backed Trump throughout his electoral campaign led to a 12.5 percent surge in the shares of the electric carmaker. Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped about 4.8 percent to its highest in nearly three years. “Business animal spirits could be rekindled once again from Trump’s pro-business approach which could lead to a more robust capital expenditures and investment environment,” said Jeff Schulze, market strategist at ClearBridge Investments. Trump Media & Technology Group, in which Trump owns a majority stake rose nearly 8 percent in choppy trading. Investors overlooked the company’s latest quarterly results that showed the Truth Social parent’s revenue was just $1m. The shares have more than tripled in value from their all-time lows in late September, and Trump’s stake was worth as much as $5.3bn, up from $3.9bn on Tuesday. Trump’s Republican Party also secured the Senate and was making gains in the House of Representatives, potentially making it easier for the president to legislate his proposals and push through key appointments. Markets “have priced in a pretty strong mandate for the Republicans and are biasing towards most of the Trump trades”, said Scott Chronert, US equity strategist at Citi. “Policy details will be important for here as the market focus seems to be putting more emphasis on deregulation, tax cuts, and a more business-friendly backdrop.” Wall Street lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs jumped between 6 percent and 10 percent on prospects of improving domestic investment, looser regulations and more deals. “Trump’s win likely means some deregulation, including rolling back banking regulations, though Big Tech may remain a bipartisan antitrust focus,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note. Semiconductor stocks advanced, with the Philadelphia chip index rising 1.8 percent and AI darling Nvidia gaining 2.7 percent despite Trump’s criticism of the US CHIPS and Science Act, which supports domestic chip manufacturing through subsidies. Trump has instead proposed tariffs on imported chips, particularly from Taiwan’s TSMC, whose US-listed shares dropped 3 percent. Oil stocks firmed 3.5 percent, while US renewable energy companies such as NextEra Energy and First Solar plunged 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Trump’s campaign laid out an energy policy platform centred around maximising US fuel and power output, in part by dismantling the Biden administration’s efforts to fight climate change. While Tesla shares surged on Musk-Trump proximity, stocks of other electric carmakers dipped as Trump had said he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. Rivian Automotive dropped 8 percent and Nikola slipped about 1.4 percent. “Nobody is making money in EVs aside from Tesla, so the reduction or elimination of EV credits will widen Tesla’s competitive moat,” said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. Fears of escalation in Sino-US tensions pressured US-listed China shares with iShares MSCI China ETF dropping nearly 2.4 percent. Import duties, including a 10 percent universal tariff on imports from all foreign countries and a 60 percent tariff on imports from China, are a key plank of Trump’s policies and likely to have the biggest global impact. Victory for Trump, who has positioned himself as pro-cryptocurrency, lifted Bitcoin to a record high. Crypto-linked stocks Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Riot Platforms, MARA Holdings jumped between 11 percent and 21 percent. Private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic jumped about more than 30 percent each as Trump’s promised crack down on undocumented immigration could boost demand for detention centres. US steel makers Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics and Nucor surged between 13 percent and 19 percent, with analysts having noted in the run-up to the election that a Trump presidency may mean rising protections for the domestic steel industry.

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $1 billion in trading volume within the first 20 minutes of market opening on November 6, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Damn, $IBIT has seen $1b in volume in the first 20min- that's about what it does in full day. Other bitcoin ETFs in same boat, crazy volume. Set for a record-breaking volume day (and given price is up so much, this is likely feeding frenzy volume vs crisis volume = look for… pic.twitter.com/1gSvV5Lwzo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 At the time of writing, over $2.5 billion worth of IBIT shares traded hands, Coinglass data shows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC saw around $464 million in volume, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, per Coinglass. Trading volume, which represents both buying and selling activity, doesn’t directly translate to net inflows. For instance, of the $4.5 billion in first-day volume for Bitcoin ETFs, only about $600 million constituted actual inflows. Balchunas suggested that IBIT could end today with huge inflows. Historically, large volume spikes during a rally have often preceded significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the analyst said. Remember the last time we saw volume spike during a rally? That was a precursor to the recent flow-athon, $IBIT alone took in $1.8b over next few days. Not saying it's guarantee but i'm fan of patterns and it fits pattern. https://t.co/YbkshZ5lOw — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 His projection was based on similar patterns observed on October 30, when IBIT’s trading volume surpassed $3.3 billion, which later converted into $643 million in net buying, Crypto Briefing reported. That marked the fund’s heaviest inflow since March 12 when Bitcoin neared $73,000. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, IBIT shed over $44 million yesterday. US spot Bitcoin ETFs also ended the day with approximately $117 million in net outflows, extending its losing streak to three consecutive days. The recent spike in IBIT trading comes amid Bitcoin’s price rally to around $74,400, up over 6% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin recently established a new record high of $75,358 on CoinGecko. The milestone was achieved against the backdrop of the 2024 US elections, with projections indicating that Donald Trump was set to secure a second term in office. Trump’s victory was later confirmed as major media outlets, including FOX News, the Associated Press, and NBC, officially declared him the winner of the 2024 election.

Title: Super Micro Computer stock bleeds 24% after it can’t even say when it will post actual earnings

Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI+11.72%) shares plummeted more than 24% on Wednesday after the AI hardware company released a disappointing preliminary first-quarter report and failed to confirm a timeline for its actual first-quarter results. The San Jose-based company, which missed the deadline for filing its annual report, is also facing a potential Nasdaq delisting. The company reported unaudited quarterly results on Tuesday after the market closed, leading to the sharp sell-off. This development follows the recent resignation of its auditor, Ernst & Young, which departed last week, citing disagreements over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. On Wednesday, the stock was trading near $21, marking a fresh 52-week low. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 82%, erasing over $55 billion in value. For the quarter ending September 30, Super Micro reported net sales between $5.9 billion and $6 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, which had forecasted $6.45 billion. The company’s forecast for the December quarter also fell short of expectations, and it projected revenue between $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion, which was below the consensus estimate of analysts of $6.86 billion. Additionally, Super Micro expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to range from 56 cents to 65 cents, while analysts had anticipated EPS of 83 cents. On Tuesday, the company made no mention of Ernst & Young’s departure or any ongoing corporate governance concerns. However, CEO Charles Liang did confirm that Super Micro is actively working to hire a new auditor. It’s important to note that the company has not reported audited financial results since May. Moreover, the company is facing potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. The company makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI, and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.56% GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. CEO Liang said on Tuesday that the company is working closely with Nvidia and that the demand is strong. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) on Value Investing by Double Alpha Factory’s Substack by Maksim. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GTX. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX)'s share was trading at $7.34 as of Nov 4th. GTX’s trailing and forward P/E were 6.02 and 5.95 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A close up of an engine piston with a commercial turbocharger attached. Garrett Motion (GTX) operates as a key player in the mobility and industrial technology sector, focusing on high-performance turbocharging solutions for light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and industrial applications. Known for its mechanical and electrical turbo products, GTX caters to a broad spectrum of vehicle types, including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas engines, with some revenue now coming from its E-Boosting and hydrogen fuel cell compression solutions. As of 2023, GTX leads in turbochargers for internal combustion engines (ICEs), a critical technology that enables automakers to meet fuel efficiency and emission standards without sacrificing power or performance. This niche, heavily dominated by Garrett Motion and BorgWarner, has a high barrier to entry due to the technical complexity involved. Additionally, a significant portion of GTX's revenue is secured years in advance, with more than 80% of OEM sales planned four years ahead, providing solid visibility into future cash flows. Despite the auto industry's shift towards battery electric vehicles (BEVs), GTX’s turbo business remains resilient, with turbocharger penetration expected to exceed 50% in ICE-based vehicles through 2030. As BEV adoption has slowed due to infrastructure, cost, and consumer preference challenges, hybrids—where turbo penetration is even higher—are likely to account for a larger portion of future vehicles. This benefits GTX, as hybrids require more advanced turbo systems, which offer higher margins. Moreover, GTX’s commercial and industrial applications, such as backup power generators and marine engines, represent a significant growth area, accounting for about 30% of total sales and offering higher profitability than light vehicle applications. This segment continues to expand, especially in sectors like marine and backup power, where demand is surging due to their role in ensuring stable power for critical infrastructure, such as data centers. CEO commentary from recent earnings calls reflects GTX's confidence in the durability of its turbo business, which caters to both diesel and natural gas engines for high-demand applications like locomotives and off-highway vehicles. In terms of financials, GTX projects substantial free cash flow (FCF) generation over the next five years. Management estimates between $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion in FCF, with the lower end of this forecast still translating to a FCF yield of approximately 20% based on its current market capitalization of around $1.6-$1.7 billion. This robust FCF, along with GTX’s forward sales visibility, makes it likely that the company could repurchase its entire outstanding share base within five years, even after allocating around $0.5 billion toward new zero-emission technologies. Given the current 41% BEV penetration assumption in these projections—an aggressive forecast—GTX’s outlook could improve further if BEV adoption rates continue to lag. The slow pace of the BEV transition, noted at the 2024 J.P. Morgan Automotive Conference, reinforces the durability of GTX's revenue base, as the turbocharger market retains a long tail of demand. Recent discussions, including those from major industry events and political forums, highlight various challenges facing BEV adoption, such as prohibitive costs, consumer hesitancy, and infrastructure inadequacies. In Europe, for example, the ambitious goal to ban non-BEV vehicles by 2035 faces substantial resistance, with auto executives and government officials questioning the feasibility of such rapid changes. In the U.S., adoption rates for BEVs are likewise decelerating, as indicated by recent regulatory shifts to ease tailpipe standards. The Biden administration, for instance, reduced its BEV adoption targets amid political and industry feedback. Meanwhile, automakers are doubling down on hybrids, which offer a balance between emission reduction and operational efficiency. Companies like Ford and General Motors are pivoting to hybrids due to profitability concerns, reinforcing GTX’s position in the evolving vehicle mix. In China, EV manufacturers are increasingly exploring hybrid technologies, acknowledging the profitability and flexibility advantages of hybrid systems over pure BEVs. Garrett's sustained focus on hybrids and ICE solutions aligns well with these market shifts, positioning it as a critical supplier for automakers facing stringent efficiency mandates but limited by BEV scalability issues. From an investment perspective, Garrett Motion's (GTX) valuation is attractive, trading at a discount relative to its cash flow potential. With a market cap of approximately $1.6 to $1.7 billion, GTX is projected to generate $1.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years. This cash flow can be utilized for substantial stock buybacks, potentially enhancing shareholder value and driving the stock price higher. The company’s diverse revenue streams, particularly in expanding commercial and industrial applications, provide resilience amid uncertainties in the transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In a worst-case scenario, investors can anticipate a 20% return over the next five years, followed by a 10% return in subsequent years, indicating a solid margin of safety. Comparatively, GTX's closest competitor, BorgWarner, trades at free cash flow yields of around 8-10%, about half of GTX’s yield. This difference implies a potential upside of 50-100% for GTX if the market aligns its valuation with that of BorgWarner. The investment thesis is based on GTX's strong market position, ongoing demand for internal combustion engines (ICE) and hybrid vehicles, clear revenue visibility, diversification into high-margin industrial applications, and robust free cash flow generation. Collectively, these factors underscore GTX's status as an undervalued entity with significant upside potential, particularly if the transition to BEVs is slower than anticipated. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 32 hedge fund portfolios held GTX at the end of the second quarter which was 35 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia becomes the world's most valuable company by market capitalization — Chipmaker dethrones Apple for the second time this year

Nvidia is now worth more than Meta and Amazon combined. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI hype is in full throttle, as Nvidia is now the largest company in the world by market cap. With a market capitalization of $3.52 trillion, Nvidia has effectively dethroned Apple for the second time this year. This news follows developments in the stock market, with Nvidia's shares surging by 2.72% this morning. All top leaders had a bullish start to the day, but a 0.64% uptick wasn't enough for Apple to hold off the green storm. Nvidia now stands as the world's largest company by market cap, but will it be able to defend its position? If so, for how long? A deeper dive into Nvidia's stock shows that just one year ago, its market cap stood at roughly $1.1 trillion, netting us a 214% increase in the stock price within just 365 days. This is genuinely unprecedented growth, most of which can be attributed to Nvidia's ventures in the AI market as the chipmaker's accelerators continue to fuel the hype train. Q2 24 earnings show that Nvidia's revenue rose by 141% QOQ, increasing to $10.3 billion in data centers, while gaming was a measly 11% at $2.5 billion. With virtually every company planning to get a piece of the AI pie, they still require chips specifically tailored for Artificial Intelligence training and inference. Nvidia's latest Blackwell-based B100 and B200 GPUs are reportedly sold out for the next 12 months. Companies revolving around AI, such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, you name it, are all in an arms race to procure the latest chips from Nvidia. AMD's CDNA3-based MI325X and the upcoming CDNA4-based MI355X could shake things up somewhat. For the time being, companies might still be inclined to prefer Nvidia due to its better software stack; however, more competition is good for evsuitablene - even multi-trillion-dollar conglomerates. The question boils down to mass-scale production since data centers and supercomputers require 10,000 to 100,000 GPUs, so it ultimately depends on whether either company can fulfill the required demand within the required time. These have been two very eventful years for not just Nvidia but its CEO, Jensen Huang, who is set to receive an honorary doctorate in engineering. Financially, consumer GPUs seem to be an afterthought for Nvidia, although leaks suggest that Nvidia is eying a January 2025 reveal for the much-anticipated RTX 50 series.

Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.05%) blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy continue to soar, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The Danish pharma giant posted its third-quarter earnings report early Wednesday morning and boasted sales figures blowing past analysts’ projections. “We are pleased with the performance in the first nine months of 2024. The sales growth is driven by increasing demand for our GLP-1-based diabetes and obesity treatments, and we are serving more patients than ever before,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in a statement. Sales of the company’s weight loss drug Wegovy skyrocketed 79% to 17.3 billion Danish Krone ($2.5 billion) in the third-quarter of 2024, compared with in 9.6 billion Danish Krone ($1.37 billion) during the the same period last year. The drug beat analysts’ expectations of $2.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS-0.80%) Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Wegovy belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications — made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+2.10%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are both now working to increase their production of these meds and curb the sale of cheaper off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. Eli Lilly reported its third-quarter earnings last week, but its blockbuster weight-loss drug failed to meet expectations. Sales of Zepbound, which launched last November, reached $1.2 billion in sales in the third-quarter of 2024, below analysts’ expectations of $1.7 billion, according to FactSet.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. AMD continues the theme with its second generation of 3D V-Cache to deliver unparalleled gaming performance and middling productivity. Thankfully, most gamers do not care about the benchmark-breaking number crunching as long as they get their framerate boosts, and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers that sweet extra FPS. It's not a big enough jump to tempt those happy with a previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but anyone on Ryzen 5000 chips or jumping ship from Intel will love it if the $30 MSRP hike and AM5 overhauls don't sour the temptation. Crushes Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K in gaming with a cheaper cost Compatible with most AM5 CPU coolers without new adapters Around 8-22% of generational performance increases Upgrading from 5000X3D means all-new motherboards and DDR5 RAM $30 more expensive than its Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor 7800X3D users could wait for the next generation with bigger gains Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. I can tell you that extra cores and threads benefit raw productivity performance, but I'll always feel the temptation of a gaming-centric CPU that delivers boosted framerates, something AMD has repeatedly delivered with its -X3D chips. • Price and availability• CPU benchmarks• Gaming benchmarks• Competition• Should you buy? It's a simple fact that consistently proves itself with each processor generation: gamers want the best performance for their money and will take any desktop boosts as a convenient side effect. AMD has remained in the top-seller spot for most CPU retailers, with the previous-generation Ryzen 7 7800X3D sitting pretty as the gaming champion since its release. If that were ever to change, it'd be with a direct successor, and that's the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, here at last. While I've tested processors from both Intel and AMD, my personal PCs have always used AMD Ryzen chips for modern builds and even AMD Athlon 64 many years before that. I've watched them evolve and still choose them for myself. At its launch, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the only Zen 5 processor in AMD's Ryzen 9000X3D range. More variants, presumably (but so far unconfirmed) a 9900X3D and 9950X3D, are expected to follow. Price: $479 at Newegg Release: November 7, 2024 Cores: 8 Threads: 16 Base clock: 4.7GHz Max boost: Up to 5.2GHz L3 cache: 96MB Base TDP: 120W The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is an 8-core, 16-thread APU (SoC) running at a 120W base TDP like its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Its specs are also similar to AMD's Ryzen 7 9700X chip, which runs at a lower TDP with a reduced L3 cache, focused on productivity rather than gaming. Officially launching with a $479 MSRP, which is $30 more expensive than the $449 Ryzen 7 7800X3D it replaces, actual store listings come relatively close with some minor inflation. AMD has moved from a 4nm process to 5nm via TSMC's foundry but remains on the same AM5 socket with compatible 9000X3D motherboards and supports the same CPU coolers as its previous-gen Zen 4 (7000 Series) chips. Upgrading from a Ryzen 7000X3D chip would be a straightforward process for enthusiasts. Still, it wouldn't provide as much of a performance leap as it would for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D or similar AM4 variants using now-incompatible DDR4 memory modules (RAM) as AM5 requires DDR5. Having previously tested AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 8000 Series processors like the Ryzen 5 8600G and Ryzen 7 8700G, I already had access to a compatible AM5-socket motherboard with the ASUS ROG STRIX B650-A Gaming WiFi. However, AMD provided all-new samples to ensure compatibility with the latest BIOS software and EXPO-compatible RAM running at 6000MHz. Arctic sent its Liquid Freezer III 360mm AIO to help test a separate processor, but it still offers the best cooling performance here. This review was made possible with review samples provided by G.SKILL, Samsung, and MSI via AMD alongside Arctic. The companies did not see the contents of the review before publishing. No matter what a processor was designed for, it always passes my usual gamut of synthetic benchmarks that test single-core and multi-core performance in various productivity tasks. As fun as it would be to skip right to the gaming tests, it's important to see where the Ryzen 7 9800X3D ranks among its peers in burst processing and longer, sustained stress tests. For burst processing tests in Geekbench 6, the 9800X3D scores above its lower-powered non-X3D sibling, the $359 Ryzen 7 9700X, in multi-core performance but below in single-core equivalents. In synthetic productivity benchmarks, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D performed around 21-22% faster than its predecessor, the 7800X3D. Of particular note is how far ahead Intel's $589 Core Ultra 9 285K pulls in multi-core tests, as by design, but there isn't much of a gap in the single-core category — remember this when I compare gaming performance next. Otherwise, there's about a 22% generational burst performance improvement over AMD's predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Sustained stress tests with Cinebench 2024 show a similar story, with the 9800X3D scoring slightly ahead of the Ryzen 7 9700X as before while creeping on the heels of Intel's $309 Core Ultra 5 245K. In the long run, single-core performance falls in favor of Intel, with more of a lead gained by the Core Ultra 9 285K as it once again places miles ahead in multi-core equivalents, dominating productivity by a colossal degree. Again, a 21% generational sustained performance over the 7800X3D matches the burst tests. In its official documentation for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, AMD touts an average 8% performance improvement in gaming compared to the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The amount depends on a range of engine-specific quirks that determine how CPU-bound or GPU-bound a title can be, though the percentage gap usually increases over time with post-launch driver updates. Nevertheless, the 7800X3D, until now, was the best gaming CPU available, so these improvements are no real surprise — so, it's far more interesting to compare the 9800X3D against Intel's top-end CPU: the Core Ultra 9 285K. While writing my Intel Core Ultra 9 285K review, no graphical setting changes would significantly increase my FPS in Forza Horizon 5. While it's likely a bug, this chart accurately represents the best framerate I can achieve at this time with the 'High' preset at 1080p. Matching estimations, Black Myth: Wukong scores almost identically on AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, while the "121.9%" gains promised in the CPU-centric title Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation didn't manifest in my testing, sticking around 6% instead. While not much of a surprise given its excellent performance on practically any hardware, Forza Horizon 5 scores an outrageous average of 387 FPS, which is perfect for anyone who uses those 360Hz 1080p gaming monitors. However, something clearly is bugged on Intel's side, so I'm skipping the implied percentage gain for Forza. Moving from a disastrous launch to a patched-up marvel, Cyberpunk 2077 sees a 52% performance increase on the 9800X3D over Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, proving far better of a pairing to NVIDIA's current high-end GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card. Far Cry 6 bumps up performance by 43% with the same GPU and DDR5-6000 RAM pairing, and the latest blockbuster Call of Duty entry enjoys a 41% lead as the 9800X3D earns extra frames in Black Ops 6. So, while I'm testing a tighter scope of popular AAA titles on PC, I still saw around a 36% performance increase in gaming with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Naturally, my number would be lower if I only tested games closer to the 100% to 110% range of AMD's generational game performance chart, but seeing visually-rich megahits like Call of Duty and Cyberpunk 2077 score such significant increases is reassuring for the performance of a brand-new processor at day one. Yes, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU you can buy, taking over from its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. 96MB of second-generation 3D V-Cache in the Zen 5 architecture helps push for higher FPS (frames per second) in games than Intel's top-end Core Ultra 9 285K, a rival processor that features more cores and threads, a higher clock speed, and slightly higher TDP. Ultimately, Intel's more expensive CPU offers better multi-core performance in productivity tasks and synthetic benchmarks, but AMD wins in gaming performance. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D has three significant competitors, though only two would be taken seriously by anyone on a budget. Internally, Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K stands against AMD's gaming CPU simply because it's the most powerful chip in the latest Core Ultra Series 200S range. However, this 24-core, 24-thread carries a price tag of around $589 to $630 and targets an entirely different audience who prioritizes energy efficiency within a productivity-centric software suite. Gaming performance on Intel's side remains relatively unchanged from its last-gen Core i9-14900K, which offered similar performance to its i9-13900K predecessor and suffered from an overarching microcode launch bug that was later fixed for the continued manufacturing of 14th Gen chips. Still, listings for the Core i9-14900K sit around $440 as AMD's Ryzen 9800X3D is ready to launch, making it an attractive option since some of its best motherboards support an established LGA 1700 socket with wide DDR4 and DDR5 RAM support, bringing down the overall cost of a custom build. The other major competitor is a call from inside Team Red's house, as the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D doesn't fall far enough behind the new 9800X3D to warrant an upgrade from anyone who already has one. On the other hand, those who already adopted the AM5 socket with all-new motherboards and DDR5 RAM could happily swap out their processor for this new replacement without buying any extra components, but dropping almost $500 on an 8-22% potential performance gain isn't so tempting. So, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D stands as a more logical upgrade path for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D from 2022. Still, this lumps users with the mandatory motherboard and RAM upgrades, though most AM4-compatible CPU coolers will work with AM5 replacements, so it's not entirely damaging to your budget. The bright side is that you'll feel a more significant boost if you upgrade from the 5800X3D, with compatibility for PCIe 5.0 (Gen 5), unlocking faster storage options with the CPU bump. Overall, it's a sticky situation because the only people who will see the most significant benefits are the ones doomed to spend extra cash on a total rig overhaul. ✅ You want the absolute best gaming CPU on the market. ✅ You crave the highest framerate count possible for high-FPS gameplay. ❌ You're already using a Ryzen 7 7800X3D or high-end 14th Gen Core i9. ❌ You rely on productivity apps that demand the best multi-core performance. Make no mistake: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU, politely dethroning its predecessor as the new king of the hill as a cache-heavy monster. However, it's not winning any awards for productivity. It isn't worth installing into a PC that spends most of its time crunching numbers in Microsoft Office and Teams since the 9900X and 9950X dominate that category, but it's a far better pick for gamers than anything from Intel's modern productivity-centric offerings. Unfortunately, those who'll benefit most will need to spend a sizeable amount of cash on a new motherboard and RAM upgrades, making the 9800X3D MSRP hike sting a little more than a cute $30. Nevertheless, this is the new meta for PC gaming, and nothing else can challenge its ability to deliver monstrous FPS counts if you can pair it with a capable GPU to enjoy the latest AAA titles loaded with visual luxuries. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is a hot pick for those willing to upgrade, taking over from the 7800X3D as the best gaming CPU and beating Intel's top offering.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) stands against the other fundamentally strong penny stocks. As per Royce Investment Partners, small caps saw a rebound in Q3, exhibiting a strong advance on both an absolute and relative basis. As per the investment management firm, the Russell 2000 Index saw an increase of ~9.3% in Q3 2024, surpassing the large-cap Russell 1000 Index (which rose ~6.1%) and the mega-cap Russell Top 50 Index (which increased ~4.2%). The investment firm believes that small caps see a long road back to the top, with large caps holding a commanding lead through the initial 9 months of 2024. On a YTD basis, the Russell 2000 saw an increase of ~11.2% compared to the respective gains of ~21.2% and ~27.3% for the Russell 1000 and Russell Top 50, in the third quarter of 2024. The investment firm said a confluence of factors might support small-caps in sustaining market leadership. The still-growing US economy, together with a more typical interest rate environment, might support small-cap leadership. As per Russell Investments, the US equity-market leadership reversed during Q3 2024, with small-cap stocks surpassing the returns delivered by their large-cap counterparts. Also, the value factor outperformed the growth factor. This means there was a significant pivot from the first 2 quarters of 2024, during which market returns were dominated by the US large-cap growth stocks— the Magnificent 7, to be precise. Russell Investments highlighted that, from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, there was a moderate change in the US average daily turnover, with $578.8 billion in Q3 2024 as compared to $581.5 billion in Q2 2024. Q3 2024 saw a shift in investor focus from high-flying tech stocks to more traditional sectors. Small-cap and value stocks surpassed the performance of large-cap and growth stocks, thanks to the broader market rotation. Moreover, utility stocks saw significant traction due to higher investments in energy infrastructure in a bid to support the elevated demand from AI and data centers.

Wall Street experts believe that the shifts in monetary policy, sectoral innovation and developments, a favorable interest rate environment, and supportive regulatory environment are expected to fuel growth in small and emerging stocks over the next year. As per Francis Gannon, Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Managing Director of Royce Investment Partners, earnings form the foundation for long-term performance. This means that earnings tend to support the broader market over the long term. He noted that the Russell 2000 saw a near-record number of companies having no earnings, with a total of ~44.6% (as of September end). Despite this, the earnings growth for the small-cap companies that have them has been estimated to be higher than large-cap ones in 2025. Chuck Royce, Founder and Senior Advisor at Royce Investment Partners, believes that the lower rates are expected to help the M&A activity. The potential buyers have been waiting for the US Fed to act before they go ahead with acquisitions. He believes that many small-caps want to get merged. Therefore, there are expectations of more strategic buyouts moving forward. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In, we used Finviz and Yahoo screeners to extract stocks trading under $5. Next, we selected the companies that have reliable 3-year revenue and 3-year net income growth rates. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Amazon is pushing ahead with its RTO policy When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Not long after hundreds of Amazon workers signed a petition against the company’s proposed five-day return-to-office policy, company CEO Andy Jassy has denied claims the mandate was introduced to quietly push workers away. At a recent all-hands meeting (via CNBC), Jassy rejected claims the RTO policy is a “backdoor layoff,” adding the push for in-person working would reinforce Amazon’s culture. The news comes after a September 2024 announcement detailing the new full-time RTO plans, set to be enacted from January 2, 2025. “A number of people I’ve seen theorize that the reason we were doing this is a backdoor layoff or we made some sort of deal with the city, or cities, and that’s why we were having people come back and be together more often," Jassy declared. The reaction from Amazon workers is understandable, given the company has laid off around 27,000 workers since tech redundancies skyrocketed in 2022. Signed by around 500 workers, the recent petition against the company’s RTO mandate alleged that AWS CEO Matt Garman’s claims many workers were on board with the change were incorrect. Prior to that, Garman also reportedly told workers unhappy with the change to consider leaving the company altogether. Up from the current three-day policy, the change to full-time office hours marks a significant shift in the tech sector. Many of Amazon’s rivals are still working on three-day mandates. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Just like Amazon, LGBTQ dating app Grindr recently faced criticism about its RTO policy. Although the specific details about its RTO policy are unconfirmed, workers alleged that they were given two weeks to relocate nearer to a hub. More than 80 were fired, many of whom citing accessibility concerns.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. The AI Boom in Big Tech is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon. This past week, artificial intelligence was the key focus for the Big Five, which together are valued at more than $10 trillion. The reporting season not only highlighted the push these big tech companies are making in AI investments but also demonstrated that they aren’t afraid to take it up any further than they already have. Previously, concerns regarding the returns from substantial AI investments had led to negative investor sentiment and even triggered a sell-off in major AI plays. However, some results are demonstrating that AI investments may be worth the wait. READ ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. “The AI theme is intact if you’re the mega caps,” as companies show that they can monetize their investments while maintaining existing profitability. As long as that infrastructure continues to be built, then we continue to be in a good place for the broader AI trade”. That said, executives of the major AI plays have fair-warned that their AI splurges will continue next year. Tech giants are racing to secure high-end chips and build sprawling data centers, forging partnerships with energy providers and much more. Each company wants to prove to Wall Street that these investments will eventually lead to greater profitability as compared to their current businesses. Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, believes that only a handful of technology names will be able to come out at the top, especially considering the high costs related to AI. This makes the situation quite favorable for well-capitalized companies. As companies ramp up their spending on AI, let’s take a closer look at how other AI players are advancing to make headlines. For starters, Perplexity, an AI conversational search engine that uses large language models to answer queries, has announced a dedicated hub for US general election information. Even though the AI-powered search engine has been seen to hallucinate from time to time, the company is keen on showing its trustworthiness when it comes to tracking election results. “Starting Tuesday, we’ll be offering live updates on elections by leveraging data from The Associated Press so you can stay informed on presidential, senate, and house races at both a state and national level. Thank you to Democracy Works for granting us access to your Elections API to help power these experiences.” The company’s election hub provides answers to election-related questions, as well as AI-generated analyses on ballot measures, policy stances, candidates, and endorsements. In other news, Noma Security, a stealth mode startup specializing in Enterprise, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence, is said to be developing tools to identify vulnerable data pipelines and code in data science environments, as well as threats like prompt injection attacks. “Existing tools are designed for the traditional software lifecycle. However, the data and AI lifecycle is inherently different. It involves distinct R&D processes, relies on different technologies, and faces unique technical vulnerabilities within AI models.” Talking about the AI pioneer OpenAI, reports from Bloomberg state that the company is in talks with California’s attorney general’s office about the process of becoming a for-profit entity. While a shift to being a for-profit company would mark a drastic reversal in the governance structure for the company, the move would also make the firm more attractive to investors. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

This past week, artificial intelligence was the key focus for the Big Five, which together are valued at more than $10 trillion. The reporting season not only highlighted the push these big tech companies are making in AI investments but also demonstrated that they aren’t afraid to take it up any further than they already have.

Title: PAC free to investigate MAHB sale, says Transport Minister

Wednesday, 06 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: Transport Minister Anthony Loke said he has no qualms if the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) investigates the sale of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) shares to a company linked to BlackRock. He said that the ministry, through the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom), is only focused on regulating competition in the industry. "If the PAC chairman Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudi wants, she may call for a meeting any time to review the deal's details. "Mavcom only looks into industry dealings from a regulatory perspective ... (and) has no say in its equity distribution. "Eventhough Mavcom is under the ministry's purview, I am not directly involved in its decision making as meetings are attended by its own board members, and the decisions they make are independent and objective based on their mandate to regulate the industry," Loke told Parliament during his ministry's winding down speech of Budget 2025 on Wednesday (Nov 6). Loke was responding to concerns raised by Mohd Radzi Md Jidin (PN-Putrajaya) over the sale of MAHB's shares to a foreign company, with the latter demanding why MAHB shares could not have been sold to local investors. This comes after Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), along with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, planned to buy a 30% stake in MAHB's privatisation move. The deal was criticised by Opposition politicians after it emerged that GIP is in talks to be sold to BlackRock, a firm that is reported to have investments in Israel.

November 06, 2024 07:47 ET | Source: Thumzup Media Corporation Thumzup Media Corporation Los Angeles, CA, Nov. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Thumzup Media Corporation ("Thumzup" or the "Company") (Nasdaq: TZUP), a leading provider of innovative social media branding and marketing solutions which allow businesses and brands to pay customers and fans cash through Venmo and PayPal for their posts on social media, is nearing completion of developing video capabilities to facilitate its proprietary ad tech platform’s integration with Instagram Reels (Instagram and its trademark are owned by Meta Platforms, Inc.). Thumzup’s mobile app has thus far only enabled users to monetize single-photo posts on Instagram. To date, the platform has facilitated more than 23,000 single-photo posts on Instagram and has paid its creators approximately $230,000 through Venmo and PayPal. With the soon to be released addition of video capabilities, Thumzup is poised to unlock even greater earning potential for its users while also providing advertisers access to Instagram Reels’ powerful platform, so they can expand their reach to an even wider audience of social media users who want to get paid for their posts. “We believe Thumzup’s planned integration with Instagram Reels should significantly accelerate our growth. We have found that many of our advertisers prefer Instagram Reels due to its higher engagement rate. In fact, it is reported that Instagram Reels receive 22% more interaction than standard video posts, and this increased visibility can lead to more in-video purchases. Furthermore, many creators in our community of users have told us they are eager to get paid for posting videos on Instagram about participating advertisers’ products and services,” stated Thumzup Chief Executive Officer Robert Steele. “With an audience of over 726 million unique users, Instagram Reels’ audience is massive and highly engaged [1]. We expect Thumzup’s Instagram Reels integration to be transformative for our community of posters, our advertisers, and for our shareholders.” [1]: https://adamconnell.me/instagram-reels-statistics/ The Thumzup app is available for download on the App Store and Google Play.

Stock futures surge after the election win by former President Donald Trump, as did with bitcoin, Trump Media (DJT), Tesla (TSLA) and the Russell 2000. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the firms that hold them, all made strong upward moves in early trading; Super Micro Computer (SMCI) declined as it provided uncertainty on filing its report and delivered weak revenue; Novo Nordisk (NVO) moved higher after reporting strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug; Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to make it the world’s most valuable company, overtaking iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring after the presidential election victory for Republican Donald Trump, with premarket trading pushing Dow futures higher by about 3% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures up roughly 2%. Futures trading for the smaller-company focused Russell 2000 jumped by more than 6%. Shares of Trump Media (DJT) were up more than 30% and Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 12% in the premarket session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 15 basis points to reach 4.45%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged to a record high, briefly topping $75,000, on the Trump victory. Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.

Stock futures surge after the election win by former President Donald Trump, as did with bitcoin, Trump Media (DJT), Tesla (TSLA) and the Russell 2000. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the firms that hold them, all made strong upward moves in early trading; Super Micro Computer (SMCI) declined as it provided uncertainty on filing its report and delivered weak revenue; Novo Nordisk (NVO) moved higher after reporting strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug; Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to make it the world’s most valuable company, overtaking iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring after the presidential election victory for Republican Donald Trump, with premarket trading pushing Dow futures higher by about 3% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures up roughly 2%. Futures trading for the smaller-company focused Russell 2000 jumped by more than 6%. Shares of Trump Media (DJT) were up more than 30% and Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 12% in the premarket session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 15 basis points to reach 4.45%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged to a record high, briefly topping $75,000, on the Trump victory. Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL).

Title: Puttshack’s Technological Twist On Mini-Golf Hits 20 Locations

The view inside a Puttshack location Putt-putt, an amusement partaken by seven-to-seventy-year-olds may conjure memories of analog-fun—ramps leading into clown mouths and windmills with blades guarding the path to the hole that your opponent would have to spin to get turning. But to younger generations, a digitally enhanced version is fast becoming par for the course. Puttshack, a fast-growing eatertainment name, has just opened the doors on its 20th location in Dunwoody, Georgia, their second venue in the Atlanta GTA. The high-tech concept which received a $150 million capital infusion from BlackRock two years-ago, ditches miniature pencils and scorecards for their proprietary Trackaball technology, where the ball itself keeps tabs on players’ strokes and tabulates scores. “It knows the difference between you hitting the ball, and the ball hitting features on the course and so much to my children’s chagrin, you can’t actually cheat in the game so it does take some elements out of the traditional mini golf I remember as a kid,” CEO Logan Powell explained. Unlike traditional golf where were the lower your tally the better, scoring is via a modified Stableford system of sorts, with points awarded for birdies, pars and hole-in-ones, yet also subtracted for rolling into a hazard. There’s almost a pinball dynamic at play, with “supertube” markers on each hole that if hit, gush up point totals, setting the stage for plenty of lead changes within a round, which is by design. Powell views the dynamic scoring system through the prism of competitive socializing and wanted to facilitate as many opportunities to turn a round, well around, as possible. “We wanted to make sure that if you want to make a comeback, it levels the playing field a little bit and I can tell you from experience that I can go from crushing it one round and play the same course and just do horribly. Having those fun innovations, which also build on themselves—if you hit multiple super tubes in a row you get extra bonus points—the game encourages you to build up streaks and really go after it,” Powell adds, that often at the wire, it’s still anybody’s game. Holes feature skateboard style half pipes, a take on Connect Four, a tribute to beer pong and a basketball hole where a robot defender attempts to prevent balls from dunking.Its fair to say that their philosophy on hole design, is to keep the creative wheels turning. “We have a phenomenal innovation team based out of the U.K. who design all of our holes and we have new ones we’re developing now. We wanted to take the fun, nostalgic aspects of mini golf that you would think of from playing the traditional game but elevate it to target the demographic that tends to come to our stores—the 21-39 year old crowd,” Powell said, adding that they like elements to be recognizable but then to add a technology twist. Less than a year ago, they introduced the Challenge Hole, a private mini-golf suite where couples and small groups could eat-drink-play in a single location while playing a variety of putting themed games including a spin on Nintendo’s Duck Hunt, the point and shoot classic currently celebrating its 40th anniversary. “The ducks go across a screen and there are slots to put the the ball into and you’re trying to hit the ducks,” Powell explained, adding that reserving the Challenge Hole is popular for date nights. Addison, Texas is the beta test for the product and they plan to offer it as well in future locations, though a decision to retrofit existing locations to include one is still being considered. Puttshack’s main differentiating factor from other eatertainment concepts facilitating flatstick fun is how much it leans into technology. Though you find scorecards either at Puttery, which uses touchscreens to keep score or Tiger Woods’ Popstroke where an app is used to keep tallies and order food and drinks. The new Dunwoody location in Northern Atlanta, typifies the type of real estate sweet spots they scout for in order to hit their demographic trifecta—families, the corporate crowd and adults seeking an evening entertainment option. Domestically, locations average an ample 25,000 square feet and include dedicated private event space which get a lot of use over the holidays. “We typically target more urban locations, those hotspot areas within a market where you or your friends would think about going. When we think about a Puttshack location, it needs to be in an area where people tend to work, live, and play. We want to make sure we are in the consideration mix there,” Powell said. A group dining at a Puttshack location Beyond the mini-golf experience, the apps at Puttshack are as international as a Presidents Cup squad, offering shareables that range from Lebanese hummus and Korean bao buns to Thai fried chicken and Canadian-style poutine. Every location even has its own take on spring rolls—dubbed ‘tailpipes’—tailored to the local market. The Atlanta area locations feature fire-braised chicken, collard greens, and pimento cheese, served with BBQ and peach dipping sauces. Puttshack also gives back through its menu, with $1 of each tailpipe purchase supporting area charities. Their Boston location donates to the New England Center for Children, while the newly opened Dunwoody site supports Lost-n-Found, a local nonprofit that provides services to homeless LGBTQ+ youth. Powell expects the demand for experiential entertainment with friends, family and loved ones outside the home will continue to grow and welcomes new concepts pile into the space. “I think winners within the space will tend to have a technological competitive edge and that’s why we continue to innovate and make sure we have fresh ideas.” With only 20 units, Powell feels Puttshack is still merely scratching the surface in terms of expanding their footprint. On the near horizon, they have new stores in various stages of completion in the Minneapolis, Chicago and Fort Lauderdale areas and see plenty of opportunity to continue to expand in markets they already have a presence in, as they’ve done in Atlanta.

Title: Trump Media, Tesla, and crypto stocks surge as Trump wins — and clean energy companies tumble

Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election boosted shares of his social media company, Elon Musk's Tesla, as well as cryptocurrencies and related stocks on Wednesday. The former president's reelection sent renewable-energy stocks tumbling in premarket trading as traders bet his administration would be less friendly in terms of subsidies and regulation. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group surged as much as 62% to $55 as investors wagered Truth Social's parent company, which counts Trump as its largest shareholder, would benefit from his second term. The stock — which has Trump's initials, DJT, as its ticker — was trading 33% higher at last check. If the gain holds, Trump would be about $1.3 billion richer on paper given his near-53% stake in the company. Tesla stock rose as much as 15% in premarket trading and was poised to open at its highest level in more than a year. Musk, the electric-vehicle maker's CEO, has emerged as one of Trump's most vocal champions and closest advisors. If Tesla's overnight gain holds, Musk — already the world's richest person — would become $14 billion richer based on his roughly 13% stake. Bitcoin, the most popular crypto, climbed past $75,000 for the first time on election night before paring gains. Other digital coins including ethereum also jumped. Crypto stocks jumped on the prospect of a friendlier US regulatory environment under Trump. Coinbase and MicroStrategy both rose 13% ahead of the open. Conventional financial stocks also gained with Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR rising between 6% and 9% in the US premarket. Traders expect Wall Street banks, asset managers, and private equity firms to benefit from tax cuts and deregulation under Trump. In contrast, clean-energy stocks slid with Plug Power, SunRun, First Solar, and Enphase Energy all dropping at least 10% in premarket trading. Danish wind turbine manufacturer Orsted and rival Vestas fell 10% and 8% respectively in Frankfurt trading. The declines likely reflect concerns that Trump's reelection will lead to the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Biden administration, which provided large-scale tax credits for renewable-energy providers. The broader stock market gained before the open with futures underlying the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing more than 2.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.8%.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the the Associated Press on Wednesday morning put him over the top, with Trump now set to have the distinction of being the 45th and the 47th US president. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Futures tied to the 10-year Treasury note (10Y=F), meanwhile, rose 16 basis points to trade around 4.4%. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rallied to a record alongside a surge in the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) as the evening's returns bolstered the "Trump trade." Outside of the presidential election, Republicans have also flipped the Senate. Control of the House of Representatives remains unclear. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Earlier this week, Harris and Trump made their final pitches to voters. Trump pledged last-minute tariffs and less money for chips while Harris promised to "seek common ground" in her final rally in Philadelphia on Monday. American voters gave Donald Trump a commanding victory, powered in large part by an intense voter focus on inflation that has been evident for years. But Trump's key campaign promise of new tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants could put new upward pressure on prices, the very issue that appears to have powered him to a win. A note from Capital Economics late Tuesday night crystallized some of the macroeconomic worries. The authors wrote that they expected Trump to push forward on his proposed immigration curbs and tariffs. They said that as a result, “We are minded to reduce our GDP growth forecast ... by roughly 1% and add 1% to our inflation forecast over the same period.” Read here for more about what Trump could mean on the key economic issue of price pressures, as well as taxes.= US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A recent call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the Associated Press on Wednesday morning confirmed the victory. After a steady rally in stock futures overnight as Harris' path to victory narrowed, futures tied to the three major averages built on earlier jumps on the news. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Meanwhile, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RTY=F) were up more than 6.5%. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) is pushing higher as investors bet on a faster pace of inflation under new Trump tariffs, and a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Fed. “Overall though we think that a Trump win means higher inflation in the near-term versus the status quo with Harris, but slower growth (potentially shaving up to 0.5 percentage points off of GDP in 2025 and 2026). For FOMC policy, we think the Fed will continue to ease this year, but likely take a pause in the first half of 2025 as it waits to get a better sense of the impact of the new administration's policies on inflation and growth,” TD’s head of global strategy Rich Kelley said. The 10-year yield was up 14 basis points to around 4.26% early on Wednesday. For now, markets are taking this move in yields in stride. But keep in mind this is a market that loves prospects of more rate cuts. If that thesis gets pushed aside under Trump as tariffs spur new inflation, markets could recalibrate to the downside. Global stock markets had a mixed reaction to the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, as the Republican closed in on a second term in the White House. In China, stocks fell sharply on Wednesday, with Shanghai's blue-chip CSI 300 (000300.SS) closing 0.5% lower, and Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng (^HSI) down 2.3%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises (^HSCE) Index fell 2.6%. But Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei 225 (^N225) climbed 2.6%, while the broader Topix (0P00006NXB.T) stock index gained 1.9%. The rally came as the Japanese yen (JPY=X) sank to its lowest since July and the dollar (USD=X) strengthened. Europe's major stock gauges jumped in early trade. London's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) moved up 1.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) benchmark rose 1.6% as Frankfurt's DAX (^GDAXI) and Paris's CAC 40 (^FCHI) gained. Tesla (TSLA) shares are surging 13% in premarket trading as Donald Trump looks to be on the verge of winning the presidency again. A win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in pole position to shape the EV maker's future, given his strong backing of Trump — or at least, that is how Wall Street sees it early on. Says Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives in a note: For more on Tesla's roadmap under a potential Trump presidency, here is our chat on the topic on a recent episode of my Opening Bid podcast. Donald Trump took the stage in Palm Beach, Fl. in the early morning hours on Wednesday as he neared closer to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidential election. "This is a movement like nobody’s ever seen before," he told the crowd in what sounded like a victory speech. "[This is] forever the day the American people regained control of their country." The Associated Press has not officially called the election. So far, Trump has secured 267 votes compared to Kamala Harris's 224. US stock futures soared as the results of the US presidential election all but confirmed a Donald Trump victory over Kamala Harris. The former president secured North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, three critical swing states, according to the Associated Press (AP). Results from Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan remain unclear. Per the AP, Trump is just 3 electoral college votes short of clinching the win. As of 2:30 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each jumped around 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up over 2.0%. Republicans have won control of the Senate, the Associated Press projected early Wednesday. The GOP flipped a Democratic-held seat in West Virginia, as Republican Jim Justice won the open seat. In Ohio, meanwhile, Bernie Moreno unseated Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Democrats lost a key member of their coalition in the upper chamber (as my colleague Ben Werschkul detailed earlier in the blog). Seven seats hang in the balance, with Republicans looking for more gains. They are eyeing a pickup in Montana, where incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is trailing Republican challenger Tim Sheehy. Races in the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona remain too close to call. Democrats currently hold all those seats. Head over to the Yahoo News live blog for more election insights and updates. As US stock futures climbed late Tuesday, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RTY=F) were the star performer, rising as much as 3% to outpace their larger peers as investors bet on the likelihood that Donald Trump will win the presidential election. Companies within the index, which include regional banks and smaller domestic players, are expected to benefit from anticipated policies out of the Trump administration like lower taxes and cutting regulations. Tariffs that a Trump administration would also be expected to enact pushed the dollar higher overnight Tuesday, a benefit for small-cap companies that tend to be more levered to the domestic economy compared to more internationally oriented large-cap stocks. GOP challenger Bernie Moreno has defeated Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, according to the Associated Press. It’s a victory that almost surely means Republicans will take control of the Senate in 2025, but one that also has consequences for the crucial Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee. That committee, which Brown currently leads, has been the scene of closely watched hearings in recent years, with top CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon and Bank of America’s (BAC) Brian Moynihan forced to answer questions from lawmakers on a range of topics. Those hearings will surely continue in 2025 but now likely with a friendly lawmaker kicking off the questioning. The current GOP ranking member on that committee is Sen. Tim Scott. The South Carolinian has tended to be much friendlier to bank concerns, especially around banking regulations. It’s a handover that could have a keen impact on policy, especially if Donald Trump ends up winning back the White House. One top concern over the last year has been the proposed Basel III endgame requirements that would increase the reserve requirements on banks. Scott has often criticized the proposal, including leading a call on the Biden administration to withdraw it entirely. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped to all-time highs late Tuesday as bets on Donald Trump accelerated in prediction markets. The former president has captured 198 electoral college votes compared to Kamala Harris's 112, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Bitcoin prices soared over 8% to trade around $74,200 a token — leaping past its previous record of around $73,750 a coin on March 14. Other crypto-adjacent names moved in tandem with bitcoin. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) moved over 4% higher in after-hours trading while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose over 3%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies like dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Ripple (XRP-USD) also jumped on the developments, rising 30% and 5%, respectively. Financial markets might be sniffing out a presidential win. One of the first big moves in markets on election night was a jump in the value of the US dollar (DX=F), which began strengthening around 7:45 p.m. ET. That occurred as the New York Times' prediction needle began to tilt slightly in Donald Trump’s direction, based on rising odds of Trump winning the swing states of Georgia and North Carolina. Other forecasts suggest a similar Trump edge. Here's the logic for a stronger dollar: Trump wants to impose new tariffs on more than $3 trillion worth of imports, which would push up prices and make inflation higher than it would otherwise be. Higher inflation generally means higher interest rates, and higher rates would draw more global investments to US securities because of the higher return. More demand for US assets boosts demand for the dollar, making it more valuable relative to other currencies. Still, this is an early move and does not mean Trump is destined for victory, though Harris is now unlikely to win in a landslide. Key swing states, including the "blue wall" of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in addition to North Carolina and Georgia, had not yet been called as of 10:25 p.m. ET. The Trump trade is rallying, with the US dollar (DX=F), bitcoin (BTC-USD), and equity futures all pushing higher as Trump secured 178 electoral college votes compared to Harris's 99, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Decision Desk HQ, a private company that projects election results, projected Trump to also win North Carolina, a key swing state. Bitcoin prices extended gains by over 7% to trade above $72,800, while the US dollar rose to its highest level since July. Against other currencies like the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso, the US dollar is up over 1%. Near 9:40 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose about 1.1%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) also jumped over 1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 1.2%. Political betting markets made a limited move toward Donald Trump early in what is expected to be a long election night. As of 9:15 p.m. ET, the odds on Kalshi.com, a political prediction market open to US citizens, stood at 68% in Trump’s favor, projecting he would win about 2 out of 3 hypothetical contests. The odds were similar on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, sitting at 72.4% at 9:15 p.m. ET. It was a noticeable — but far from definite — jump on both sites from the odds earlier in the night before the polls closed when both markets showed Trump's odd about 10 percentage points lower. The surge in these markets was most evident a bit after 7:30 p.m. ET. Gains for Trump noticeably leveled off and largely held steady throughout the 8 p.m. hour. Both sites are continuing to accept bets throughout the night, with Kalshi touting that their main market now has over $280 million at stake. Citi analysts detailed “election trades to track," and YF's Rick Newman highlighted seven of them: solar energy, fossil fuels, deregulation, tariffs, inflation, antitrust, and housing. A reminder that while stocks don't care who the president is, and mostly like certainty, the election results will have implications across industries. Read more here. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 3% in after-hours trading as election results continued to pour in Tuesday night. More results are expected to be announced in the coming hours. Tech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of the election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve "with all the things he's got going on." Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder Doug Clinton told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination on Tuesday that "it will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk." "He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction," said Clinton, who is also managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. "I think if it goes against him — if Kamala Harris is elected president — I think it probably is a negative for him." It's possible Tesla could still benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a continuation of Biden's green energy push. As a result, if Trump loses, Musk could likely "find some way to try to mend fences," Clinton said. "Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world," he said. Tesla shares are up about 1% since the start of the year. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump could come down to coin-flip odds and may not be known for hours (if not days). But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of results that could sway markets. Everything from which party will lead key congressional committees to the sway that certain industries like cryptocurrencies will have in Washington, D.C., are also on the ballot. Curious what races Jamie Dimon and crypto executives will be watching most closely? Read on here. A lot of folks on the Street I have chatted up this week are bracing for a big move in markets Wednesday morning, as the belief is that the winner of the election will be known later on tonight. Moreover, either winner would be seen as a surprise for markets (weird how these things are viewed by investors). Take that with a grain of salt, as such groupthink could mean we don't get a big move in markets on Wednesday. Amid the action, I would keep a close eye on bond yields, as markets could very well take their direction from them, based on my conversations. It's a point the Goldman Sachs team made today in a note making the rounds this evening: "The upcoming US elections could drive further upward pressure on global bond yields and indigestion for equities," said Goldman Sachs strategist Andrea Ferrario. Ferrario added, "Rising bond yields might eventually become a speed limit for equities if real yields start to increase (vs. real GDP growth expectations) or if increases in bond yields are too rapid." Futures moved firmly into green figures on Tuesday evening as early results from the US presidential election rolled in while cryptocurrencies surged and the US dollar also gained. Near 8 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved roughly 0.5% higher. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 0.7%. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) was also up as much as 4.5% to trade north of $71,000. The dollar was also stronger against most major currency pairs, including the yen and euro. So far, Trump has won Kentucky, West Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana, while Harris has claimed Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, according to the Associated Press. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged more than 20% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as early votes showed Trump clinch Kentucky and Indiana. The stock had a wild session during market hours after trading was halted several times due to volatility. Shares somewhat recovered from steeper losses but still closed down a little over 1%. Shortly after the market close, DJT reported third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The company also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Read more here.

Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Earlier this week, Harris and Trump made their final pitches to voters. Trump pledged last-minute tariffs and less money for chips while Harris promised to "seek common ground" in her final rally in Philadelphia on Monday. American voters gave Donald Trump a commanding victory, powered in large part by an intense voter focus on inflation that has been evident for years. But Trump's key campaign promise of new tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants could put new upward pressure on prices, the very issue that appears to have powered him to a win. A note from Capital Economics late Tuesday night crystallized some of the macroeconomic worries. The authors wrote that they expected Trump to push forward on his proposed immigration curbs and tariffs. They said that as a result, “We are minded to reduce our GDP growth forecast ... by roughly 1% and add 1% to our inflation forecast over the same period.” Read here for more about what Trump could mean on the key economic issue of price pressures, as well as taxes.= US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A recent call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the Associated Press on Wednesday morning confirmed the victory. After a steady rally in stock futures overnight as Harris' path to victory narrowed, futures tied to the three major averages built on earlier jumps on the news. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Meanwhile, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RTY=F) were up more than 6.5%. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) is pushing higher as investors bet on a faster pace of inflation under new Trump tariffs, and a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Fed. “Overall though we think that a Trump win means higher inflation in the near-term versus the status quo with Harris, but slower growth (potentially shaving up to 0.5 percentage points off of GDP in 2025 and 2026). For FOMC policy, we think the Fed will continue to ease this year, but likely take a pause in the first half of 2025 as it waits to get a better sense of the impact of the new administration's policies on inflation and growth,” TD’s head of global strategy Rich Kelley said. The 10-year yield was up 14 basis points to around 4.26% early on Wednesday. For now, markets are taking this move in yields in stride. But keep in mind this is a market that loves prospects of more rate cuts. If that thesis gets pushed aside under Trump as tariffs spur new inflation, markets could recalibrate to the downside. Global stock markets had a mixed reaction to the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, as the Republican closed in on a second term in the White House. In China, stocks fell sharply on Wednesday, with Shanghai's blue-chip CSI 300 (000300.SS) closing 0.5% lower, and Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng (^HSI) down 2.3%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises (^HSCE) Index fell 2.6%. But Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei 225 (^N225) climbed 2.6%, while the broader Topix (0P00006NXB.T) stock index gained 1.9%. The rally came as the Japanese yen (JPY=X) sank to its lowest since July and the dollar (USD=X) strengthened. Europe's major stock gauges jumped in early trade. London's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) moved up 1.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) benchmark rose 1.6% as Frankfurt's DAX (^GDAXI) and Paris's CAC 40 (^FCHI) gained. Tesla (TSLA) shares are surging 13% in premarket trading as Donald Trump looks to be on the verge of winning the presidency again. A win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in pole position to shape the EV maker's future, given his strong backing of Trump — or at least, that is how Wall Street sees it early on. Says Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives in a note: For more on Tesla's roadmap under a potential Trump presidency, here is our chat on the topic on a recent episode of my Opening Bid podcast. Donald Trump took the stage in Palm Beach, Fl. in the early morning hours on Wednesday as he neared closer to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidential election. "This is a movement like nobody’s ever seen before," he told the crowd in what sounded like a victory speech. "[This is] forever the day the American people regained control of their country." The Associated Press has not officially called the election. So far, Trump has secured 267 votes compared to Kamala Harris's 224. US stock futures soared as the results of the US presidential election all but confirmed a Donald Trump victory over Kamala Harris. The former president secured North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, three critical swing states, according to the Associated Press (AP). Results from Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan remain unclear. Per the AP, Trump is just 3 electoral college votes short of clinching the win. As of 2:30 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each jumped around 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up over 2.0%. Republicans have won control of the Senate, the Associated Press projected early Wednesday. The GOP flipped a Democratic-held seat in West Virginia, as Republican Jim Justice won the open seat. In Ohio, meanwhile, Bernie Moreno unseated Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Democrats lost a key member of their coalition in the upper chamber (as my colleague Ben Werschkul detailed earlier in the blog). Seven seats hang in the balance, with Republicans looking for more gains. They are eyeing a pickup in Montana, where incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is trailing Republican challenger Tim Sheehy. Races in the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona remain too close to call. Democrats currently hold all those seats. Head over to the Yahoo News live blog for more election insights and updates. As US stock futures climbed late Tuesday, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RTY=F) were the star performer, rising as much as 3% to outpace their larger peers as investors bet on the likelihood that Donald Trump will win the presidential election. Companies within the index, which include regional banks and smaller domestic players, are expected to benefit from anticipated policies out of the Trump administration like lower taxes and cutting regulations. Tariffs that a Trump administration would also be expected to enact pushed the dollar higher overnight Tuesday, a benefit for small-cap companies that tend to be more levered to the domestic economy compared to more internationally oriented large-cap stocks. GOP challenger Bernie Moreno has defeated Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, according to the Associated Press. It’s a victory that almost surely means Republicans will take control of the Senate in 2025, but one that also has consequences for the crucial Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee. That committee, which Brown currently leads, has been the scene of closely watched hearings in recent years, with top CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon and Bank of America’s (BAC) Brian Moynihan forced to answer questions from lawmakers on a range of topics. Those hearings will surely continue in 2025 but now likely with a friendly lawmaker kicking off the questioning. The current GOP ranking member on that committee is Sen. Tim Scott. The South Carolinian has tended to be much friendlier to bank concerns, especially around banking regulations. It’s a handover that could have a keen impact on policy, especially if Donald Trump ends up winning back the White House. One top concern over the last year has been the proposed Basel III endgame requirements that would increase the reserve requirements on banks. Scott has often criticized the proposal, including leading a call on the Biden administration to withdraw it entirely. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped to all-time highs late Tuesday as bets on Donald Trump accelerated in prediction markets. The former president has captured 198 electoral college votes compared to Kamala Harris's 112, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Bitcoin prices soared over 8% to trade around $74,200 a token — leaping past its previous record of around $73,750 a coin on March 14. Other crypto-adjacent names moved in tandem with bitcoin. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) moved over 4% higher in after-hours trading while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose over 3%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies like dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Ripple (XRP-USD) also jumped on the developments, rising 30% and 5%, respectively. Financial markets might be sniffing out a presidential win. One of the first big moves in markets on election night was a jump in the value of the US dollar (DX=F), which began strengthening around 7:45 p.m. ET. That occurred as the New York Times' prediction needle began to tilt slightly in Donald Trump’s direction, based on rising odds of Trump winning the swing states of Georgia and North Carolina. Other forecasts suggest a similar Trump edge. Here's the logic for a stronger dollar: Trump wants to impose new tariffs on more than $3 trillion worth of imports, which would push up prices and make inflation higher than it would otherwise be. Higher inflation generally means higher interest rates, and higher rates would draw more global investments to US securities because of the higher return. More demand for US assets boosts demand for the dollar, making it more valuable relative to other currencies. Still, this is an early move and does not mean Trump is destined for victory, though Harris is now unlikely to win in a landslide. Key swing states, including the "blue wall" of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in addition to North Carolina and Georgia, had not yet been called as of 10:25 p.m. ET. The Trump trade is rallying, with the US dollar (DX=F), bitcoin (BTC-USD), and equity futures all pushing higher as Trump secured 178 electoral college votes compared to Harris's 99, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Decision Desk HQ, a private company that projects election results, projected Trump to also win North Carolina, a key swing state. Bitcoin prices extended gains by over 7% to trade above $72,800, while the US dollar rose to its highest level since July. Against other currencies like the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso, the US dollar is up over 1%. Near 9:40 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose about 1.1%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) also jumped over 1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 1.2%. Political betting markets made a limited move toward Donald Trump early in what is expected to be a long election night. As of 9:15 p.m. ET, the odds on Kalshi.com, a political prediction market open to US citizens, stood at 68% in Trump’s favor, projecting he would win about 2 out of 3 hypothetical contests. The odds were similar on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, sitting at 72.4% at 9:15 p.m. ET. It was a noticeable — but far from definite — jump on both sites from the odds earlier in the night before the polls closed when both markets showed Trump's odd about 10 percentage points lower. The surge in these markets was most evident a bit after 7:30 p.m. ET. Gains for Trump noticeably leveled off and largely held steady throughout the 8 p.m. hour. Both sites are continuing to accept bets throughout the night, with Kalshi touting that their main market now has over $280 million at stake. Citi analysts detailed “election trades to track," and YF's Rick Newman highlighted seven of them: solar energy, fossil fuels, deregulation, tariffs, inflation, antitrust, and housing. A reminder that while stocks don't care who the president is, and mostly like certainty, the election results will have implications across industries. Read more here. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 3% in after-hours trading as election results continued to pour in Tuesday night. More results are expected to be announced in the coming hours. Tech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of the election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve "with all the things he's got going on." Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder Doug Clinton told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination on Tuesday that "it will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk." "He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction," said Clinton, who is also managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. "I think if it goes against him — if Kamala Harris is elected president — I think it probably is a negative for him." It's possible Tesla could still benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a continuation of Biden's green energy push. As a result, if Trump loses, Musk could likely "find some way to try to mend fences," Clinton said. "Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world," he said. Tesla shares are up about 1% since the start of the year. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump could come down to coin-flip odds and may not be known for hours (if not days). But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of results that could sway markets. Everything from which party will lead key congressional committees to the sway that certain industries like cryptocurrencies will have in Washington, D.C., are also on the ballot. Curious what races Jamie Dimon and crypto executives will be watching most closely? Read on here. A lot of folks on the Street I have chatted up this week are bracing for a big move in markets Wednesday morning, as the belief is that the winner of the election will be known later on tonight. Moreover, either winner would be seen as a surprise for markets (weird how these things are viewed by investors). Take that with a grain of salt, as such groupthink could mean we don't get a big move in markets on Wednesday. Amid the action, I would keep a close eye on bond yields, as markets could very well take their direction from them, based on my conversations. It's a point the Goldman Sachs team made today in a note making the rounds this evening: "The upcoming US elections could drive further upward pressure on global bond yields and indigestion for equities," said Goldman Sachs strategist Andrea Ferrario. Ferrario added, "Rising bond yields might eventually become a speed limit for equities if real yields start to increase (vs. real GDP growth expectations) or if increases in bond yields are too rapid." Futures moved firmly into green figures on Tuesday evening as early results from the US presidential election rolled in while cryptocurrencies surged and the US dollar also gained. Near 8 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved roughly 0.5% higher. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 0.7%. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) was also up as much as 4.5% to trade north of $71,000. The dollar was also stronger against most major currency pairs, including the yen and euro. So far, Trump has won Kentucky, West Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana, while Harris has claimed Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, according to the Associated Press. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged more than 20% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as early votes showed Trump clinch Kentucky and Indiana. The stock had a wild session during market hours after trading was halted several times due to volatility. Shares somewhat recovered from steeper losses but still closed down a little over 1%. Shortly after the market close, DJT reported third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The company also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Read more here.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Record as Pro-Crypto Trump Heads Toward US Victory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin jumped to a record high, part of a wave of trades across global markets in response to Donald Trump emerging victorious over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The largest digital asset rose as much as 10% to $76,106 with Trump winning a second term, the Republicans taking back the Senate and the House looking increasingly more likely to remain red. The increase was the most since the last peak in March, when investors were cheered by inflows into US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade because the former president embraced digital assets during his campaign after a major push by the industry. Crypto muscled onto the high table of politics by deploying a giant campaign-finance war chest to further its agenda. Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the planet, create a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appoint regulators who love digital assets. Harris adopted a more measured approach, pledging to support a regulatory framework for the industry. In contrast, the Securities & Exchange Commission under the Biden administration pursued a crackdown via a flurry of enforcement actions. “The crypto industry feels like it’s been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years, and it senses that might be coming to an end,” said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management Inc. “People are starting to position for the next few years in crypto.” In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno beat Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown. Crypto titans spent some $40 million to defeat Brown — a longtime skeptic of the industry — underlining the influence of their political outlays. The prospect of friendlier US crypto rules led to gains across the digital-asset market. Second-ranked token Ether added about 12%. Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favorite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rallied 31% at one point. Gensler’s Fate Digital-asset companies often complained that officials under President Joe Biden failed to create a clear new legal framework for the nascent market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said existing rules apply and repeatedly labeled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on crypto following a 2022 market rout that triggered a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange. “The first test of his credibility to watch out for is whether he will deliver on his promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market making firm Auros. Bitcoin has now advanced more than 80% in 2024, topping assets such as stocks and gold. US spot-Bitcoin ETFs, from issuers such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, have attracted $23.5 billion of net inflows following their launch at the start of the year — among the most successful new ETFs in history. --With assistance from Teresa Xie and Dave Liedtka.

Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged as much as 25% before paring gains in after-hours trading on Tuesday as investors brace for more wild swings with Donald Trump edging ahead of Kamala Harris in the latest election results. All states have now closed their respective polling stations. So far, Trump has secured 248 electoral college votes, while Harris has claimed 214, according to the Associated Press. The stock had a wild session during market hours on Tuesday as trading was halted several times due to volatility, with shares quickly erasing 15% gains and reversing Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week. Despite a recovery from steeper losses, shares still closed down a little over 1%. The latest price action comes as investors await the results of the presidential election between the Republican nominee and his challenger. Volatility in the stock is expected to continue as strategists categorize the stock as a binary bet on the election. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, recently told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts that the trajectory of shares hinges on "a buy the rumor, sell the fact" trading strategy.

"If he loses, I think it goes to zero." Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick said DJT has taken on a meme-stock "life of its own." "It was volatile on the way up, and when a stock is that volatile in one direction, it has a tendency to be that volatile in the other direction," he said on a call with Yahoo Finance last week. In September, shares in the company — the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform, Truth Social — traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had bounced back from their lows, though, as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Tuesday, DJT dropped third quarter results after the market close that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Over the past nine months ending Sept. 30, revenue has fallen 23% from the prior-year period. Last month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September. Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, making his share worth billions. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Title: Bitcoin – Volatility reigns as election uncertainty spurs $541M in BTC ETF outflows

Could the inflows into BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF indicate a broader shift in investor sentiment towards Bitcoin ETFs? With the U.S Presidential election around the corner, the crypto market has seen a surge in volatility. Bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in particular, have felt the impact, with notable outflows observed on 1st and 4th November. With Election Day now here, uncertainty surrounding potential political shifts is continuing to add to the ups and downs of the Bitcoin ETF landscape. According to the latest data from Farside Investors on 4 November, Bitcoin ETFs recorded significant outflows – Totaling $541.1 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led the trend, with outflows hitting $169.6 million, followed closely by Ark 21Shares’ ARKB which saw $138.3 million in outflows. Grayscale’s BTC and Bitwise’s BITB also faced declines, with outflows of $89.5 million and $79.8 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $63.7 million outflows too. Although most ETFs reported outflows, Invesco’s BTCO and WisdomTree’s BTCW stood out by maintaining stable flows without any outflows. Despite the broader downturn, however, not all updates were negative. BlackRock’s IBIT notably bucked the trend by attracting $38.4 million in inflows. Reflecting this optimism within the crypto community, Dr. Dinero shared a positive perspective, highlighting hopeful sentiment despite recent market turbulence. Source: Dr. Dinero/X Another X user noted, Source: Flip/X Looking at the cumulative data though, BTC ETFs have generated significant inflows since their launch, with volumes of $23 billion. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT alone recorded $26 billion in inflows. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst, had previously forecasted that BTC ETFs might soon exceed the holdings attributed to Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It was expected that these ETFs will reach this milestone by mid-December. However, a recent single-day purchase by BlackRock, totaling 12,127 BTC, has accelerated this timeline. In response to this significant accumulation, Balchunas shared his insights on X. He highlighted the swift momentum ETFs have gained in Bitcoin’s space. “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they?” This recent surge in Bitcoin ETF activity has coincided with notable price volatility in BTC itself. After touching $73,000 just days ago, Bitcoin has now dipped below the $70,000-threshold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $68,807.31, following a slight 0.10% drop over the last 24 hours. On the weekly charts, it fell by over 3%. Thus, as election season adds an extra layer of uncertainty, the crypto market might be gearing up for further volatility in the coming days.

Click to read more Swiggy, the Indian food delivery giant, recently raised $605 million by selling shares to institutional investors, including well-known names like Fidelity and Norges Bank. This funding move marks a significant step as Swiggy prepares for a $1.35 billion initial public offering (IPO), expected to be India’s second-largest IPO this year. The share sale reflects strong institutional interest in Swiggy’s stock, underscoring confidence in the company’s growth potential and market position. In addition to Fidelity and Norges, domestic mutual funds have also shown keen interest in Swiggy’s offering, collectively purchasing shares worth $246 million, as noted in a stock exchange filing by Swiggy.

Combined with its rich valuation, this could make retail investors wary — similar to how they reacted to Hyundai Motor India’s recent debut. Still, foreign investors are likely to be big buyers, given their optimism about India’s long-term consumption growth, even if Swiggy’s shares don’t come cheap.

Swiggy’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering. However, given that the company is still loss making at an aggregate level, and overall profitability may be some time away, we recommend only High Risk investors to ‘Subscribe for long term’. At the upper price band of ₹390, the issue is priced at 7.8x FY24 Market Cap to Sales and looks reasonably priced compared to Zomato which is trading at 17.5x.” Swiggy plans to utilise the IPO proceeds towards funding investment in the Material Subsidiary, Scootsy, investment in technology and cloud infrastructure, brand marketing and business promotion expenses for enhancing the brand awareness and visibility of its platform, across segments; and for funding inorganic growth through unidentified acquisitions and general corporate purposes.

Click to read more Swiggy, the Indian food delivery giant, recently raised $605 million by selling shares to institutional investors, including well-known names like Fidelity and Norges Bank. This funding move marks a significant step as Swiggy prepares for a $1.35 billion initial public offering (IPO), expected to be India’s second-largest IPO this year. The share sale reflects strong institutional interest in Swiggy’s stock, underscoring confidence in the company’s growth potential and market position. In addition to Fidelity and Norges, domestic mutual funds have also shown keen interest in Swiggy’s offering, collectively purchasing shares worth $246 million, as noted in a stock exchange filing by Swiggy. This local support from mutual funds further strengthens Swiggy’s financial backing as it moves toward its IPO, which has generated widespread anticipation in India’s financial markets. Swiggy Limited has emerged as a key player in India’s burgeoning on-demand delivery landscape. Its user-friendly app connects millions with a diverse range of services, extending far beyond food delivery to encompass groceries and logistics. Focused on innovation and convenience, Swiggy has solidified its presence, particularly in urban centres across the nation. This IPO will feature a total issue size of ₹11,327.43 crores, comprising a fresh issue of ₹4,499 crores and an offer for sale of ₹6,828.43 crores, inviting investors to partake in its growth story. Inputs from PTI report “At the upper price band of ₹390, Swiggy is available at Mcap/sales of 7.8x (on FY24 financials), which appears to be fairly priced. We assign a “Subscribe” rating for the issue on a long term investment basis, considering its strong brand recall, diversified offerings, integrated app, rapid scaling, consistent innovation, expansion of dark stores, and promising industry outlook.” QIB - NIL NII - NIL RIIs 0- 0.04 times Employee Reserved - 0.02 times Total: 0.01 times Indications from the grey market point to a muted listing-day gain for Swiggy. Combined with its rich valuation, this could make retail investors wary — similar to how they reacted to Hyundai Motor India’s recent debut. Still, foreign investors are likely to be big buyers, given their optimism about India’s long-term consumption growth, even if Swiggy’s shares don’t come cheap. Bloomberg report Track bl’s stock market live updates here Screenshot 2024-11-06 095124.png “Swiggy operates in a oligopoly market which is at a nascent stage, thus providing enough opportunities for players to create their niche. Swiggy’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering. However, given that the company is still loss making at an aggregate level, and overall profitability may be some time away, we recommend only High Risk investors to ‘Subscribe for long term’. At the upper price band of ₹390, the issue is priced at 7.8x FY24 Market Cap to Sales and looks reasonably priced compared to Zomato which is trading at 17.5x.” Swiggy plans to utilise the IPO proceeds towards funding investment in the Material Subsidiary, Scootsy, investment in technology and cloud infrastructure, brand marketing and business promotion expenses for enhancing the brand awareness and visibility of its platform, across segments; and for funding inorganic growth through unidentified acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Up to 75 per cent of issue is reserved for qualified institutional bidders, 15 per cent for non-institutional investors (HNIs) and 10 per cent for retail investors. The company has also reserved 750,000 shares for employees, which will get a discount of ₹25 from the issue price.

Title: Should You Pick META Stock At $560?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/05/should-you-pick-meta-stock-at-560/
Time Published: 2024-11-06T04:00:01Z

AUSTIN, TEXAS - SEPTEMBER 18: In this photo illustration, the Instagram logo is displayed on a ... [+] computer screen on September 18, 2024 in Austin, Texas. (Photo illustration by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) has seen a 3% fall in a week, while it’s up around 60% this year. The company recently reported its Q3 results, which were better than the street estimates. Its top line stood at $40.6 billion and the bottom line at $6.03, compared to the consensus estimates of $40.2 billion and $5.25, respectively. Despite a beat, the stock didn’t see any gains, as investors were concerned about higher costs. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s quarterly performance and its impact on META stock. Also, look at what’s happening with Google stock. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $40.6 billion in Q3 reflected a 19% y-o-y rise, driven by a 7% rise in ad impressions and an 11% growth in average price per ad. Meta also reported a 5% rise in family daily active people to 3.29 billion. Most of the company’s revenue came from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 43%, up around 300 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $6.03 per share, up 37% y-o-y. Looking forward, Meta expects its Q4 revenue to be in the range of $45 billion to $48 billion. What didn’t sit well with the investors was the company’s hike in capital spending guidance to $38 billion to $40 billion and higher investments in 2025 as well. This compares with $27 billion Meta spent in capital expenditures in 2023. Much of the new investments are related to the company’s AI push involving data centers and related infrastructure. META stock, with 60% gains this year, has outperformed some of the other large tech stocks, including GOOG, up 21%, AMZN, up 28%, and MSFT, up 9%. However, we think META stock is appropriately priced now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, aligning with its current levels. At $560, META stock is already trading at 25x expected earnings of $22.65 in 2024, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 17x over the last three years. A rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately. However, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a slight risk if it would eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings growth. For now, the story for most of the tech stocks is about valuation multiples. Some of them are trading at levels higher than seen over recent years. Although META stock has seen a 2x rise since 2021, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While META stock looks appropriately priced, it is helpful to see how Meta’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

The world's largest crypto rose to $74,504 on the day, beating its previous March all-time high of $73,780, CoinGecko data shows. Bitcoin is now up more than 9% over the last 24 hours. It has more than doubled in price in the last 12 months. It comes amid the U.S. election results between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, with the former gaining an early lead in electoral college votes. Trump or Harris need 270 electoral college votes to secure the presidency. Trump leads with 198 to Harris' 99, according to the latest figures from the Associated Press. Analysts have been citing a "Trump trade" is in play, which, they say, has helped bolster risk assets, including equities and crypto. The business mogul and former reality TV star has explicitly said he will help the digital asset industry, while Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has been quieter on the issue. Trump's renewed shot at claiming a second term in the White House has been keenly felt around the crypto industry, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel. "Trump has made material inroads in the last month," he told Decrypt before election day. "Many business leaders are all making phone calls to Donald Trump to mend fences." "There’s definitely some momentum for Trump, in my opinion," Sigel added. Previously with Bitcoin cycles, the crypto has hit highs following the asset's quadrennial halving event. This time, it's different, though, and the crypto last hit an all-time high in March, just ahead of April's halving. Bitcoin's halving happens every four years and cuts miner rewards in half, forcing those who secure the network to work harder and allowing fewer digital coins to be minted and put into circulation. But Bitcoin's spike earlier this year arguably comes down to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January approved 10 of the vehicles, which make it easy for people to buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin and trade on stock exchanges. A flood of capital has since entered the space, as traditional investors, previously too cautious about buying the asset, can now do so easily via products by Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Such funds have seen more than $20 billion worth of inflows so far this year.

Title: ‘I was lucky to be there’ – No hard feelings as Garry Ringrose looks back on his first All Black experience

Garry Ringrose: 'I certainly feel if I’m not all-in in everything I can do to try and prepare, they are exceptionally good at exposing that.' Photo: Sportsfile Garry Ringrose had the best seat in the house as he watched history unfold at Solider Field in November 2016. Like Joey Carbery, Ringrose was named in an Ireland match-day squad for the first time, but rather than follow his former Blackrock College team-mate in helping to see out the historic victory over the All Blacks, he remained on the bench for the entire 80 minutes. Scrum-half Kieran Marmion found himself in a similar position in Chicago that day, but even looking back on it now, eight years later, there was no sense of bitterness on Ringrose’s part at missing out on such a momentous occasion. Instead, Joe Schmidt handed the centre his Test debut at home the following week in the slightly less glamorous win over Canada. “It was funny, I was 21,” Ringrose recalled. “Myself and Joey Carbery were on the bench and both of us would have been nervous going into the game. “I was lucky to be on the plane because Keith Earls got injured during the week and that gave me the opportunity to be on the bench. “I couldn’t believe that I’d been selected. After the game I had a text or two saying hard luck that I hadn’t got on but I was laughing to myself because that didn’t even cross my mind. “To be there for such a special occasion, I felt I was lucky to be over there. “Even the fact that Joey came on and played so well, I was coat-tailing on how well he had done because we had gone through the week together. “It wouldn’t have been a thing, any sort of frustration. I was just excited to be there and experience such a monumental day in Irish sports history, I think. Since then, I guess I’ve been lucky to play in the ones here. “There was one game, the autumn after the Lions tour when Robbie [Henshaw] and Bundee [Aki] would have been together [up until then] and Robbie was injured which gave me the opportunity to play and get the win on a special night in the Aviva. “Experiences like that stand out and you never take them for granted, to be lucky enough to beat such an exceptional side. It’ll take everything this week to try and repeat that.” As for what Schmidt said to Ringrose after keeping him on the bench against the All Blacks, given it is a rarity in modern-day rugby not to use all eight available replacements, Ringrose added: “I can’t remember exactly but I do remember after the game in the hotel, obviously everyone was celebrating, he let me know, just a heads-up, you’re going to be starting next week against Canada. “I was pretty nervous from that point on. I wouldn’t have expected or looked for an apology at all. Everyone was buzzing, it wasn’t even a thing.” Ringrose is set to be in the thick of the action against New Zealand at the Aviva Stadium on Friday night, as Ireland aim to finish a year, which has included a Six Nations title win and a Test victory in South Africa, on a high. “When I was younger in the first couple of squads you have the blinkers on, but in the last couple of years I’ve been able to look at it from the wider lens and appreciate the amount of support we have or that I can see around the country,” Ringrose (29) maintained. “And I don’t know what it is, there just seems to be a buzz about it, definitely in the World Cup. “I know my first World Cup was in Japan so it was unbelievable travelling support, but going through a World Cup that was a little bit closer to home and seeing and feeling the support was unbelievable. “And then there’s a continuation from there, I’ve certainly felt.” Ringrose’s battle with his opposite number Rieko Ioane, who may face a frosty reception from the Dublin crowd following his war of words with Johnny Sexton, is set to be one of many box-office match-ups. “I certainly feel if I’m not all-in in everything I can do to try and prepare, they are exceptionally good at exposing that,” Ringrose added. “And in the past it shows that even when we are all-in [with our] preparation, they can still expose it with the strength they have. “They’re a team you just have to be at your best against to try to beat them. And we’ve been lucky in the past in some of those seven games to get a win and then some unfortunate results in there as well. “It’s something I never take for granted, and I’m excited for the challenge. “I guess from my experience over the last couple of years, games can fall on such fine margins and against a team of their quality, even more so. “[It will be] unbelievably special and everyone in the group would be grateful to get an opportunity to play, to deliver for the support that will be there and the support that will be watching on TV. We’re just trying to do our best to prepare as best as we possibly can.”

After making leap from sporting greatness to the world of finance, deceitful Blackrock boy was soon hoisted with his own petard Brendan Mullin was one of the best centres Irish rugby has ever had, thanks to his pace and athleticism. His place in the Ireland team was rarely in doubt. Photo: Allsport Brendan Mullin was born in 1963 in Jerusalem, where his father was on assignment, and spent his early years in Israel. When the family returned to Dublin, he was educated at Blackrock College, studied law at Trinity College Dublin and then went to Oxford.

Title: What the Latest Dow Shakeup Could Mean

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This week, two new stocks are joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nvidia Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW). The Dow is a widely followed index made up of the 30 biggest companies with a history dating back to the 1800’s. NVDA and SHW will be replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow Inc. (DOW) – no relation to the index. This week, I examine past changes to the Dow’s constituents and explore how the stocks tended to perform after being added or removed. I have a list of 26 stocks that have joined the Dow Industrials since 1997. I looked at how those stocks performed after officially being added to the index. The table below summarizes the returns. The second table is for comparison, and it shows what the returns looked like had you purchased the index instead of the individual stocks. The results are mixed. The stocks averaged an 8% return over the first three months after being added to the index with 65% of the returns being positive. However, a year after the additions, those same stocks were up just 1.74% on average, with less than half of the returns positive. Based on this, avoid NVDA and SHW and put that money in a Dow index fund. Purchasing the Dow Index rather than the stocks would have yielded a 7.45% return on average with 84% of returns positive over the next year. The last change to the Dow was earlier in February, when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). Since then, AMZN has gained over 12%, while WBA is down more than 50%. The table below shows the stocks added to the Dow since 2010. These stocks have fared better than the summarized table above but still, less than half have outperformed the index over the next six months and year. My list of stocks removed from the Dow is less than stocks added, because more of these companies have gone out of business or have been bought out. So perhaps we’re not getting the full picture. The 18 stocks I have data for have performed terribly, especially immediately after leaving the index. These stocks have averaged over an 8% loss over the next month of trading after leaving the index with only 17% being positive or beating the Dow Index. The six-month returns also underperform by a lot averaging a loss of 2.7% with 33% positive. Nine of the 18 stocks, however, have beaten The Dow over the next six months. Here’s the list of individual stocks removed from the index since 2010. These ten stocks show significant underperformance in the first month of trading, averaging a loss of 3.8% with just 30% positive and 30% beating the Dow Index. Over the longer term, the stocks eliminated from the index have done much better than stocks added. Over the next year, these stocks averaged an impressive 28% return with 67% of them beating the index. The stocks added to The Dow since 2010 have averaged a return of 6.3% with just 44% beating the Dow Index (see table above). One way to look at index changes, especially on such a popular index, is as a driver or indicator of sentiment. Stocks added to the blue-chip index could gin up some positive sentiment, while those eliminated might get the stocks off some people’s radars. I could argue the data above supports this interpretation. New stocks in the index underperformed and have been less likely to beat the index than those kicked out of the index. I’m focusing on the data since 2010. Based on the analysis, perhaps wait at least a month then take a look at the two stocks recently eliminated, INTC and SHW. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Why Professional Investors Often Misjudge the Market After a Presidential Election

Time Published: 2024-11-05T21:12:13Z

Professional investors often assume they are free of political bias. However, research suggests this is far from true. Political bias is proven to cost investors who may over- or under-estimate the state of the economy depending on whether their preferred party is in power. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. In a June Nasdaq article, investor Martin Tiller observed how many left-leaning investors dumped stocks after Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 and right-leaning investors after Barack Obama’s victory in 2008. Both were motivated by notions that the wrong party had won the election and the economy would pay a price. Yet, the S&P 500 consistently grew in the months following each president’s inauguration, duping the investors who let their bias get in the way. Academic research suggests this is a widespread phenomenon. A 2017 Journal of Financial Markets study highlighted how individuals’ investment behaviors shifted when their preferred political party held the White House. The study found that when their favored party was in power, investors became more optimistic, perceived markets as less risky, and increased allocations to high-beta, small-cap, and value stocks. Consequently, nonpartisan investors consistently outperformed their Democratic- and Republican-leaning counterparts, according to a University of Chicago study of fund performance from 2015 to 2021. Political bias affects not only market perspectives but also stock selection. Mutual fund managers often hold onto losing stocks issued by politically allied companies longer than justified, a behavioral pattern known as the “disposition effect,” according to a study by the University of Kansas of nearly 1,300 actively managed mutual funds between 2000 and 2015. In other words, fund managers may overestimate the competence of companies led by executives with similar political beliefs to theirs. The researchers found that funds with more politically-motivated stock selection have lower return-to-risk ratios. Political bias isn’t confined to equity investors. A 2020 study tracking credit analysts from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s between 2000 and 2018 showed that those not aligned with the sitting president’s party tended to issue more frequent downgrades of corporate credit ratings. Nevertheless, historical market data provides a stark reality check. Long-term market performance has proven resilient regardless of which political party holds power. The S&P 500, for example, has typically risen regardless of partisan shifts in Washington. While executive decisions from the White House can be large in scope and have long-term impact, markets can often work through them. For example, when Trump launched a trade war with China in September 2019, some analysts expected Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone sales to fall by as much as 8 million units and its share price to plummet. In the following 12 months, Apple’s stock rose 160 percent compared to the S&P 500’s 16 percent. Likewise, after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, many expected his green energy policies would hurt oil and natural gas companies. And yet, Morningstar’s data finds U.S. energy companies outperformed the S&P 500 in the year following. Political sentiments can also influence how major shareholders vote on corporate policies. Major mutual funds and asset managers tend to vote in lockstep with the political party in control at the time, according to joint research from the City University of Hong Kong and INSEAD published in the International Banker. Examining shareholder voting behavior between 2004 and 2021, the researchers found major asset managers were substantially more likely to support environmental and social initiatives when a Democrat was in the White House than when a Republican was. However, instead of bias getting in the way, another possible explanation is that major asset managers, like BlackRock (BLK), StateStreet and Vanguard, may be acting in accordance with the prevailing political party to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Further solidifying their findings, the researchers noted that voting behavior on corporate policies unrelated to environmental and social justice issues remained consistent, regardless of which political party was in power. Data confirms that the stock market reflects investors’ election jitters. VIX, an index measuring volatility in the stock market, is about 6 percent higher during election years than in other years. A higher VIX reading signals increased expected volatility and heightened market uncertainty from investors. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: X Is a White-Supremacist Site
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/x-white-supremacist-site/680538/

Donald Trump has won the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Read more from our writers on what happens next: Elon Musk has made one of Twitter’s most glaring problems into a core feature on X. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration. X has always had a Nazi problem. I’ve covered the site, formerly known as Twitter, for more than a decade and reported extensively on its harassment problems, its verification (and then de-verification) of a white nationalist, and the glut of anti-Semitic hatred that roiled the platform in 2016. But something is different today. Heaps of unfiltered posts that plainly celebrate racism, anti-Semitism, and outright Nazism are easily accessible and possibly even promoted by the site’s algorithms. All the while, Elon Musk—a far-right activist and the site’s owner, who is campaigning for and giving away millions to help elect Donald Trump—amplifies horrendous conspiracy theories about voter fraud, migrants run amok, and the idea that Jewish people hate white people. Twitter was always bad if you knew where to look, but because of Musk, X is far worse. (X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this article.) It takes little effort to find neo-Nazi accounts that have built up substantial audiences on X. “Thank you all for 7K,” one white-nationalist meme account posted on October 17, complete with a heil-Hitler emoji reference. One week later, the account, which mostly posts old clips of Hitler speeches and content about how “Hitler was right,” celebrated 14,000 followers. One post, a black-and-white video of Nazis goose-stepping, has more than 187,000 views. Another racist and anti-Semitic video about Jewish women and Black men—clearly AI-generated—has more than 306,000 views. It was also posted in late October. Many who remain on the platform have noticed X decaying even more than usual in recent months. “I’ve seen SO many seemingly unironic posts like this on Twitter recently this is getting insane,” one X user posted in response to a meme that the far-right influencer Stew Peters recently shared. It showed an image of Adolf Hitler holding a telephone with overlaid text reading, “Hello … 2024? Are you guys starting to get it yet?” Peters appended the commentary, “Yes. We’ve noticed.” The idea is simply that Hitler was right, and X users ate it up: As of this writing, the post has received about 67,000 likes, 10,000 reposts, and 11.4 million views. When Musk took over, in 2022, there were initial reports that hate speech (anti-Black and anti-Semitic slurs) was surging on the platform. By December of that year, one research group described the increase in hate speech as “unprecedented.” And it seems to only have gotten worse. There are far more blatant examples of racism now, even compared with a year ago. In September, the World Bank halted advertising on X after its promoted ads were showing up in the replies to pro-Nazi and white-nationalist content from accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers. Search queries such as Hitler was right return posts with tens of thousands of views—they’re indistinguishable from the poison once relegated to the worst sites on the internet, including 4chan, Gab, and Stormfront. The hatred isn’t just coming from anonymous fringe posters either. Late last month, Clay Higgins, a Republican congressman from Louisiana, published a racist, threatening post about the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, saying they’re from the “nastiest country in the western hemisphere.” Then he issued an ultimatum: “All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,” he wrote in the post, referencing Inauguration Day. Higgins eventually deleted the post at the request of his House colleagues on both sides of the aisle but refused to apologize. “I can put up another controversial post tomorrow if you want me to. I mean, we do have freedom of speech. I’ll say what I want,” he told CNN later that day. And although Higgins did eventually try to walk his initial post back, clarifying that he was really referring to Haitian gangs, the sentiment he shared with CNN is right. The lawmaker can put up another vile post maligning an entire country whenever he desires. Not because of his right to free speech—which exists to protect against government interference—but because of how Musk chooses to operate his platform. Despite the social network’s policy that prohibits “incitement of harassment,” X seemingly took no issue with Higgins’s racist post or its potential to cause real-world harm for Springfield residents. (The town has already closed and evacuated its schools twice because of bomb threats.) And why would X care? The platform, which reinstated thousands of banned accounts following Musk’s takeover, in 2022—accounts that belong to QAnon supporters, political hucksters, conspiracy theorists, and at least one bona fide neo-Nazi—is so inundated with bigoted memes, racist AI slop, and unspeakable slurs that Higgins’s post seemed almost measured by comparison. In the past, when Twitter seemed more interested in enforcing content-moderation standards, the lawmaker’s comments may have resulted in a ban or some other disciplinary response: On X, he found an eager, sympathetic audience willing to amplify his hateful message. His deleted post is instructive, though, as a way to measure the degradation of X under Musk. The site is a political project run by a politically radicalized centibillionaire. The worthwhile parts of Twitter (real-time news, sports, culture, silly memes, spontaneous encounters with celebrity accounts) have been drowned out by hateful garbage. X is no longer a social-media site with a white-supremacy problem, but a white-supremacist site with a social-media problem. Musk has certainly bent the social network to support his politics, which has recently involved joking on Tucker Carlson’s show (which streams on X) that “nobody is even bothering to try to kill Kamala” and repurposing the @america handle from an inactive user to turn it into a megaphone for his pro-Trump super PAC. Musk has also quite clearly reengineered the site so that users see him, and his tweets, whether or not they follow him. When Musk announced his intent to purchase Twitter, in April 2022, the New York Times columnist Ezra Klein aptly noted that “Musk reveals what he wants Twitter to be by how he acts on it.” By this logic, it would seem that X is vying to be the official propaganda outlet not just for Trump generally but also for the “Great Replacement” theory, which states that there is a global plot to eradicate the white race and its culture through immigration. In just the past year, Musk has endorsed multiple posts about the conspiracy theory. In November 2023, in response to a user named @breakingbaht who accused Jews of supporting bringing “hordes of minorities” into the United States, Musk replied, “You have said the actual truth.” Musk’s post was viewed more than 8 million times. Read: Musk’s Twitter is the blueprint for a MAGA government Though Musk has publicly claimed that he doesn’t “subscribe” to the “Great Replacement” theory, he appears obsessed with the idea that Republican voters in America are under attack from immigrants. Last December, he posted a misleading graph suggesting that the number of immigrants arriving illegally was overtaking domestic birth rates. He has repeatedly referenced a supposed Democratic plot to “legalize vast numbers of illegals” and put an end to fair elections. He has falsely suggested that the Biden administration was “flying ‘asylum seekers’, who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Arizona” and argued that, soon, “everywhere in America will be like the nightmare that is downtown San Francisco.” According to a recent Bloomberg analysis of 53,000 of Musk’s posts, the billionaire has posted more about immigration and voter fraud than any other topic (more than 1,300 posts in total), garnering roughly 10 billion views. But Musk’s interests extend beyond the United States. This summer, during a period of unrest and rioting in the United Kingdom over a mass stabbing that killed three children, the centibillionaire used his account to suggest that a civil war there was “inevitable.” He also shared (and subsequently deleted) a conspiracy theory that the U.K. government was building detainment camps for people rioting against Muslims. Additionally, X was instrumental in spreading misinformation and fueling outrage among far-right, anti-immigration protesters. In Springfield, Ohio, X played a similar role as a conduit for white supremacists and far-right extremists to fuel real-world harm. One of the groups taking credit for singling out Springfield’s Haitian community was Blood Tribe, a neo-Nazi group known for marching through city streets waving swastikas. Blood Tribe had been focused on the town for months, but not until prominent X accounts (including Musk’s, J. D. Vance’s, and Trump’s) seized on a Facebook post from the region did Springfield become a national target. “It is no coincidence that there was an online rumor mill ready to amplify any social media posts about Springfield because Blood Tribe has been targeting the town in an effort to stoke racial resentment against ‘subhuman’ Haitians,” the journalist Robert Tracinski wrote recently. Tracinski argues that social-media channels (like X) have been instrumental in transferring neo-Nazi propaganda into the public consciousness—all the way to the presidential-debate stage. He is right. Musk’s platform has become a political tool for stoking racial hatred online and translating it into harassment in the physical world. The ability to drag fringe ideas and theories into mainstream political discourse has long been a hallmark of X, even back when it was known as Twitter. There’s always been a trade-off with the platform’s ability to narrow the distance between activists and people in positions of power. Social-justice movements such as the Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter owe some of the success of their early organizing efforts to the platform. Yet the website has also been one of the most reliable mainstream destinations on the internet to see Photoshopped images of public figures (or their family members) in gas chambers, or crude, racist cartoons of Jewish men. Now, under Musk’s stewardship, X seems to run in only one direction. The platform eschews healthy conversation. It abhors nuance, instead favoring constant escalation and engagement-baiting behavior. And it empowers movements that seek to enrage and divide. In April, an NBC News investigation found that “at least 150 paid ‘Premium’ subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months.” According to research from the extremism expert Colin Henry, since Musk’s purchase, there’s been a decline in anti-Semitic posts on 4chan’s infamous “anything goes” forum, and a simultaneous rise in posts targeting Jewish people on X. X’s own transparency reports show that the social network has allowed hateful content to flourish on its site. In its last report before Musk’s acquisition, in just the second half of 2021, Twitter suspended about 105,000 of the more than 5 million accounts reported for hateful conduct. In the first half of 2024, according to X, the social network received more than 66 million hateful-conduct reports, but suspended just 2,361 accounts. It’s not a perfect comparison, as the way X reports and analyzes data has changed under Musk, but the company is clearly taking action far less frequently. Read: I’m running out of ways to explain how bad this is Because X has made it more difficult for researchers to access data by switching to a paid plan that prices out many academics, it is now difficult to get a quantitative understanding of the platform’s degradation. The statistics that do exist are alarming. Research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that in just the first month of Musk’s ownership, anti–Black American slurs used on the platform increased by 202 percent. The Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Semitic tweets on the platform increased by 61 percent in just two weeks after Musk’s takeover. But much of the evidence is anecdotal. The Washington Post summed up a recent report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, noting that pro-Hitler content “reached the largest audiences on X [relative to other social-media platforms], where it was also most likely to be recommended via the site’s algorithm.” Since Musk took over, X has done the following: None of this is accidental. The output of a platform tells you what it is designed to do: In X’s case, all of this is proof of a system engineered to give voice to hateful ideas and reward those who espouse them. If one is to judge X by its main exports, then X, as it exists now under Musk, is a white-supremacist website. You might scoff at this notion, especially if you, like me, have spent nearly two decades willingly logged on to the site, or if you, like me, have had your professional life influenced in surprising, occasionally delightful ways by the platform. Even now, I can scroll through the site’s algorithmic pond scum and find things worth saving—interesting commentary, breaking news, posts and observations that make me laugh. But these exceptional morsels are what make the platform so insidious, in part because they give cover to the true political project that X now represents and empowers. As I was preparing to write this story, I visited some of the most vile corners of the internet. I’ve monitored these spaces for years, and yet this time, I was struck by how little distance there was between them and what X has become. It is impossible to ignore: The difference between X and a known hateful site such as Gab are people like myself. The majority of users are no doubt creators, businesses, journalists, celebrities, political junkies, sports fans, and other perfectly normal people who hold their nose and cling to the site. We are the human shield of respectability that keeps Musk’s disastrous $44 billion investment from being little more than an algorithmically powered Stormfront. The justifications—the lure of the community, the (now-limited) ability to bear witness to news in real time, and of the reach of one’s audience of followers—feel particularly weak today. X’s cultural impact is still real, but its promotional use is nonexistent. (A recent post linking to a story of mine generated 289,000 impressions and 12,900 interactions, but only 948 link clicks—a click rate of roughly 0.00328027682 percent.) NPR, which left the platform in April 2023, reported almost negligible declines in traffic referrals after abandoning the site. Continuing to post on X has been indefensible for some time. But now, more than ever, there is no good justification for adding one’s name to X’s list of active users. To leave the platform, some have argued, is to cede an important ideological battleground to the right. I’ve been sympathetic to this line of thinking, but the battle, on this particular platform, is lost. As long as Musk owns the site, its architecture will favor his political allies. If you see posting to X as a fight, then know it is not a fair one. For example: In October, Musk shared a fake screenshot of an Atlantic article, manipulated to show a fake headline—his post, which he never deleted, garnered more than 18 million views. The Atlantic’s X post debunking Musk’s claim received just 28,000 views. Musk is unfathomably rich. He’s used that money to purchase a platform, take it private, and effectively turn it into a megaphone for the world’s loudest racists. Now he’s attempting to use it to elect a corrupt, election-denying felon to the presidency. To stay on X is not an explicit endorsement of this behavior, but it does help enable it. I’m not at all suggesting—as Musk has previously alleged—that the site be shut down or that Musk should be silenced. But there’s no need to stick around and listen. Why allow Musk to appear even slightly more credible by lending our names, our brands, and our movements to a platform that makes the world more dangerous for real people? To my dismay, I’ve hid from these questions for too long. Now that I’ve confronted them, I have no good answers.

Title: Elon Musk’s Twitter Takeover Set Off a Race to the Bottom

Time Published: 2024-11-05T19:41:17Z

In the final lead-up to the US presidential election, Elon Musk has thrown the full weight of his celebrity and his resources behind former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump. He has appeared with Trump on the campaign trail; pumped money into a pro-Trump PAC (which has, in turn, bought ads on the platform he owns); and made X a hotbed of right-wing conspiracy theories, some of which he has personally boosted, that many experts say are designed to undermine faith in the outcome of the elections. But Musk’s behavior is also having another effect: It’s taking scrutiny off other tech leaders and companies, even as they cozy up to Trump or roll back policies that would protect the information ecosystem ahead of a major election. “In a race to the bottom, Elon Musk paved the way for a new, toxic tech basement,” says Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the nonprofit Free Press. “Yet, as long as other platforms aren’t quite as abysmal, they squeak by under cover of Twitter’s failures.” Social media companies have largely replaced traditional media conglomerates as gateways to information. According to a Pew Research study, 54 percent of adults now get at least some of their news from social media. And that number is much higher for people below the age of 50. Sixty-four percent of people aged 30–49 and 78 percent of people 18–29 get news from social media. “[Musk] is smart enough to understand that to control the narrative, you want to control the media,” says a former Twitter employee. “And social media is media.” But these companies don’t face the same kind of restrictions and responsibilities that traditional media do. Section 230 prevents social media companies from being held legally liable for the content on their platforms. Content moderation is largely voluntary, except in cases where the content itself is illegal (like child sexual abuse material), which has its own consequences. A 2020 study from the Harvard Misinformation Review found that people who relied on social media for their news were more likely to believe misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic. A different Pew Research study, also from 2020, found that Americans who relied on social media for their news had lower political knowledge than those who didn’t. But for years, public pressure from government officials, civil society, and the media pushed tech companies to invest in teams and tools that could at least somewhat address issues of hate speech or misinformation on their platforms, so they could say they were making a good-faith effort to deal with the issue. Musk’s purchase of Twitter signaled a change, according to six former trust and safety employees from Twitter and Meta. When Musk took over Twitter in October 2022, he quickly fired more than 50 percent of the company’s workers, including almost all of the company’s trust and safety and policy staff—the people tasked with creating and enforcing the platform’s policies around things like hate speech, violent content, conspiracy theories, and mis- and disinformation. Since then, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Discord have all made cuts to trust and safety staff. Shortly after Musk purged Twitter of its trust and safety teams, other companies began layoffs. In November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, including many trust and safety employees. In January 2023, Google followed suit, axing 12,000 people. Earlier this year, Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, disbanded its Safety Advisory Council. “I think that Elon really opened the floodgates,” says one former Meta employee. “So then other tech brands were like, ‘We can do that too, because we won't be the black sheep for it.’” Meta spokesperson Corey Chambliss tells WIRED that the company has “40,000 people globally working on safety and security—more than during the 2020 cycle, when we had a global team of 35,000 people working in this area,” though he did not address how many of those people are staff versus outsourced workers. Musk’s sudden firings made it so that “anybody else could come along and nicely fire their teams and give them severance and it was nicer. Better,” says a former Twitter employee who was fired by Musk. After Musk fired the trust and safety staff, experts warned that this cut, coupled with Musk’s “free speech absolutism,” would allow toxic content to flood the platform and ultimately cause an exodus of users and advertisers, leading to Twitter’s eventual demise. Hate speech and misinformation did increase, and advertisers did pull their dollars. Last year, X fired members of what remained of its elections team. Around the same time, Musk posted on X, saying, “Oh you mean the ‘Election Integrity’ Team that was undermining election integrity? Yeah, they’re gone.” But X is still alive and kicking. Musk’s behavior, say the former employees, acted as cover for other platforms that saw trust and safety work as a burdensome cost. The work of teams focused on ad sales or user engagement drives growth and money for platforms. Trust and safety teams, former employees say, do not. This makes them easy targets when companies tighten their belts. “I think [layoffs] were something Mark [Zuckerberg] wanted to do for a long time,” says the former Meta employee. “And so, if Twitter can get away with having less good technology and less good infrastructure than other companies, and is still getting rid of thousands of people, which is proportionally way more than any amount laid off by Google or anyone else, then I think that that kind of empowered other companies too.” Chambliss says that Musk’s decisions did not play a role in Meta’s layoffs, referring to a 2023 post about the company’s “year of efficiency.” It’s not just staffing that has shifted since Musk took the helm at X. Google and Meta have made significant changes to how they handle political content and mis- and disinformation. Last year, YouTube, which is owned by Google, announced that it would “stop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past US presidential elections.” Google spokesperson Elena Hernandez told WIRED, “There were no cuts to the Trust and Safety teams that work on elections. We continue to make significant investments in the people, policies, and systems that enable Google and YouTube to be a reliable source for election-related news and information.” Hernandez did not respond to questions about whether the company would be updating its policies around election fraud claims in anticipation of the US presidential elections. Recent reporting from The New York Times found that lies about the election have since spread widely on the platform. In previous years, a story like that might have put pressure on YouTube to enforce or change its policies, but now, conservative activist Christopher Rufo wrote on X, “in a post-Elon environment, YouTube's response is: ‘The ability to openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial, is an important value—especially in the midst of election season.’” “I think the public antics of Musk are diverting attention away from other companies who continue to launch products or make policy changes that demand careful thinking and transparency,” says Sabhanaz Rashid Diya, founder of the Tech Global Institute, a think tank focused on tech policy and a former Meta employee. Earlier this year, Meta announced that it would no longer recommend political content to users on Threads and Instagram—though what exactly counts as politics remains unclear. Last year, the company removed restrictions on ads claiming the 2020 election was stolen and on Covid-19 misinformation. In July it removed restrictions on Trump’s Facebook account, which has 35 million followers. In August, less than three months ahead of the elections, it also wound down the tool Crowdtangle, which allowed journalists and civil society to monitor content on Meta’s platforms. (After taking over X, Musk announced that he would charge $40,000 for access to the platform’s API). While X under Musk has presented a whole host of new issues for advocates and civil society, less attention has been paid to other, established platforms having many of the same problems they’ve had for years. Reporting from WIRED found that nearly four years after the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, militia groups are still organizing on Facebook, with the platform even autogenerating pages for interested users. Meta’s and TikTok’s systems still can’t reliably detect ads containing election disinformation. Amazon’s Alexa told users the 2020 election was stolen. “We do not have visibility on whether ad models in the lead-up to major elections have been changed, or whether researchers have been able to meaningfully engage with platforms and user metrics to study key information trends,” says Diya. “We still have unresolved questions about basic product or policy features that warrant continued scrutiny and should not be sidelined amidst specific individuals or one company monopolizing airtime.” “Musk doesn’t take responsibility for anything on his platform, so it makes it a lot easier for other platforms to do the same,” says Alexandra Pardal, CEO of Digital Action, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on human rights and technology. “He’s changed norms about what’s acceptable and not, about what a responsible social media platform looks like. Musk has successfully masked [these changes] by making this the Elon Show.” In a recent interview with the Acquired podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he regretted allowing Meta to take responsibility for things that he saw as outside its mandate or control. “People are basically blaming social media and the tech industry for all these things in society—if we’re saying, we’re really gonna do our part to fix this stuff, I think there were a bunch of people who just took that and were like, oh, you're taking responsibility for that? Let me, like, kick you for more stuff.” Bloomberg also noted a shift in Zuckerberg’s approach to the 2024 election—namely, to avoid saying much about it at all. Musk is obviously not the only driving force for this change. Tech companies have come under increasing scrutiny from both sides of the aisle, particularly from the GOP. This has made it particularly painful—and risky—for them to take action on certain topics. For instance, last year, a federal judge issued an injunction preventing social media companies from talking to the government, saying that Biden officials “engaged in a broad pressure campaign designed to coerce social-media companies into suppressing speakers, viewpoints, and content disfavored by the government." For companies like Meta, that meant that their threat detection teams were unable to alert or hear from federal agencies about issues. The Supreme Court ruled this summer that complainants lacked standing. In August, Zuckerberg issued a letter to Jim Jordan’s congressional Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, saying that the company had, indeed bowed to government pressure to remove misinformation about Covid-19. (Three former Meta employees who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity say that they did not get the sense that government pressure was behind Meta’s choices to suppress or remove Covid-19 misinformation at the time.) Pardal says that if Musk was not behaving so outrageously, she doubts that Zuckerberg “would be saying he made a mistake.” And Trump, it seems, approves. In an interview with the Barstool Sports podcast Bussin’ With the Boys, Trump said, “I actually believe [Zuckerberg’s] staying out of the election, which is nice.” The former president has also claimed that other tech executives, including Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook, are supporters. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, prevented an editorial endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris from running, the same day that executives from his space company, Blue Origin, met with Trump, signaling a willingness on the part of the industry to cooperate with a possible second Trump administration. (Bezos appeared unmoved, even in the face of more than 200,000 people canceling their subscriptions to the paper.) But none of these nods toward Trump are as obvious as Musk’s support for the former president, and the use of X to seed mis- and disinformation about the election, says Pardal. “[Musk] has drawn attention away from other tech companies and onto himself, when it comes to tech harms,” says Pardal. “Now we are all talking about what Elon says next, and moving away from the discussion about the decline in platform safety at a time of exponentially rising risks.” You can follow all of WIRED's 2024 presidential election coverage here.

Title: Brendan Mullin one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur era

Full Content:
Brendan Mullin (61), who has been found guilty on 12 charges of stealing hundreds of thousands of euro from Bank of Ireland Private Bank when he was its managing director a decade ago, was one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur era. Born in Jerusalem, he was educated at Blackrock College, which he captained to a Schools Senior Cup success, scoring a hat-trick of tries in the final against King’s Hospital. He was also twice the senior boys All Ireland 110m hurdles champion (1980-1981). Mullin studied Law at Dublin University while representing Trinity at rugby. He also played club rugby with Blackrock College and London Irish. Mullin then headed for Oxford University, where he won a “Blue” playing in the annual Varsity match against Cambridge. Having represented Leinster and Ireland at schools’ level, he graduated to the senior ranks for province and country. He made his Ireland debut against the Grand Slam-winning Australia side in November 1984, a losing start as the home side went down 16-9, but there was better fortune around the corner as he was part of Mick Doyle’s Triple Crown and championship winning side (1985) in his rookie Test season. Mullin scored his first Irish try in that campaign, where he blocked down England fullback Chris Martin’s kick and regathered to dot down. An elegant centre with blistering pace and an underappreciated kicking game, he played alongside some very talented three-quarters in Irish backlines such as Simon Geoghegan, Dave Curtis, Jim Staples, Michael Kiernan, Keith Crossan, Trevor Ringland and Hugo MacNeill. [ Ex-rugby international Brendan Mullin found guilty of stealing hundreds of thousands of euro from bankOpens in new window ] A member of the Ireland squad for the first-ever World Cup in 1987, Mullin was subsequently selected for the 1989 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia under head coach Ian McGeechan, one of four Irish players in the original touring party, alongside Paul Dean, Steve Smith and Donal Lenihan, and played well enough to win a place in the first Test against the Wallabies, playing alongside Mike Hall (Wales). Mullin broke George Stephenson’s 62-year-old record as Ireland’s leading try scorer when he crossed for his 15th in a 28-25 defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield in March 1991 The Lions were thrashed 30-12, and among the changes for the final two Tests, both of which the Lions won to claim the series 2-1, was a new centre partnership of Scott Hastings and Jerry Guscott. Mullin did play another Test for the Lions, against France later that year, to celebrate the bicentenary of the French Revolution. He broke George Stephenson’s 62-year-old record as Ireland’s leading try scorer when he crossed for his 15th in a 28-25 defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield in March 1991, and later that year was part of the Ireland team that suffered a narrow World Cup quarter-final defeat at Lansdowne Road to the eventual champions, Australia. By the time he retired from rugby – he came back to play in the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, having been out of international rugby for two years, and retired for good after the quarter-final defeat to France, the last of his 55 Irish caps – Mullin had added another two tries to push the new Irish record to 17, a milestone that he retained for a dozen years until broken by Brian O’Driscoll. [ Brendan Mullin one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur eraOpens in new window ] The former Ireland captain eclipsed the mark when he scored his 18th Irish try against Italy in Rome (2003) on his 35th cap, 20 fewer than it took Mullin, who sent O’Driscoll a congratulatory note and a signed jersey from that final cap against France in the 1995 World Cup. He said in a subsequent interview when asked about losing the record to O’Driscoll: “No regrets at all. It’s a milestone. It was something I was very proud to hold on to for a while, but it’s something to be broken. Many more players will break that milestone and that’s good for Irish rugby, while Brian will go on to score many more tries.” Mullin is due to be sentenced on November 25th.

Title: A new weight loss drug could beat Ozempic's side effect problem

The Denmark-based drug maker Zealand Pharma said Tuesday that its experimental weight-loss drug could help patients lose pounds with fewer side effects than current anti-obesity medications on the market. The company said that only about a third of patients that took up to 4.8 milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea — one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand revealed the new finding at the industry conference ObesityWeek in San Antonio, Bloomberg reports. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can’t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nauseau, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand Pharma reported in June that there were no serious or severe adverse events during the study and only one out 48 participants dropped out of the trial due to side effects. “These results support our conviction that petrelintide is very well tolerated and can potentially play an important role as an alternative to incretin-based therapies for the management of overweight and obesity,” said Zealand chief medical officer David Kendall in a press release, at the time. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Zealand’s petrelintide works different from Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs as it doesn’t mimic the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Instead, it mimics a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas that increases satiety, known as amylin. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost on average 8.6% of their weight. For comparison, a clinical trial of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.05%) Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. The company plans start a mid-stage trial of the drug later this year and expects it could hit the market in 2029 or 2030, according to Bloomberg. In August, the company said it is looking for a potential partnership with a big pharma company to help it develop, manufacture, and sell petrelintide. GLP-1s are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. Demand for these medications have turned Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+2.10%), the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Now, several pharmaceutical companies are working to introduce new drugs to get in on the demand. In addition to Zealand Pharma, Viking Therapeutics, Regeneron, Amgen, and Pfizer are all developing new weight-loss drugs.

Title: Amazon gets FAA approval for new delivery drone as it begins tests in Arizona

BREAKING: The Fed cuts its key interest rate again Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Amazon said Tuesday it received regulatory approval to begin flying a smaller, quieter version of its delivery drone, the latest step in its long-running efforts to get the futuristic program off the ground. The company unveiled the new drone, called the MK30, in November 2022. It said then that the MK30, in addition to the other changes, would fly through light rain and have twice the range of earlier models. Amazon said the Federal Aviation Administration’s approval includes permission to fly the MK30 over longer distances and beyond the visual line of sight of pilots. The agency granted a similar waiver for Amazon’s Prime Air program in May, though that was limited to flights in College Station, Texas, one of the cities where it has been conducting tests. Alongside the FAA approval, Matt McCardle, head of regulatory affairs for Prime Air, said the company is starting to make drone deliveries Tuesday near Phoenix, Arizona. In April, Amazon said it planned to spin up drone operations in Tolleson, a city west of Phoenix, after it shut down an earlier test site in Lockeford, California. The company will dispatch the drones near one of its warehouses in Tolleson as it looks to integrate Prime Air more closely into its existing logistics network and further speed up deliveries. An FAA spokesperson said the agency granted Amazon permission to conduct beyond visual line of sight deliveries in Tolleson on Oct. 31. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos first unveiled plans for the ambitious service more than a decade ago, remarking at the time that the program could be up and running within five years. Despite Amazon investing billions of dollars into the program, progress has been slow. Prime Air encountered regulatory hurdles, missed deadlines and had layoffs last year, coinciding with widespread cost-cutting efforts by CEO Andy Jassy. The program also lost some key executives, including its primary liaison with the FAA and its founding leader. Amazon hired former Boeing executive David Carbon to run the operation. It has also encountered pushback from some residents in the cities where it is trialing drone deliveries. Residents in College Station complained about the noise levels enough that it prompted the city’s mayor to mention the concerns in a letter to the FAA, CNBC previously reported. In response, Amazon executives told residents the company would identify a new drone delivery launch site by October 2025. Amazon is not the only company trying to crack delivery by drone. It is competing with Wing, owned by Google parent Alphabet; UPS; Walmart; and a host of startups including Zipline and Matternet.

Title: Vornado Reports Strong Office Leasing as NYU Master Leases 770 Broadway
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/11/vornado-reports-strong-office-leasing-nyu-master-leases-770-broadway/
Time Published: 2024-11-05T18:40:41Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Steven Roth’s Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) reported lower cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 than it generated in the previous year’s third quarter, but the real estate investment trust emphasized its improving office leasing numbers — with New York University agreeing to master lease 1.1 million square feet at 770 Broadway — with high rents as it winds down the year. During Tuesday’s third quarter earnings call, Vornado reported funds from operations reached $99.25 million in the third quarter of 2024, down from $119.48 in the previous year’s third quarter. Moreover, funds from operations for the first nine months of the year hit $352.9 million, down from $382.5 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. The firm’s dividend to shareholders in the third quarter ended at 52 cents per diluted share, less than 66 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Roth struck a confident and defiant tone when reporting the firm’s financials, and said that Vornado expects to pay a dividend of 68 cents per share to shareholders at the end of the year in order to conserve cash. In 2023, Vornado suspended dividend payments beginning in April of that year. “While our business is financially better and improving, we’ll continue to be rigorous with cash management,” he said. “This strategy has been understood and is endorsed by our major shareholders. I expect as conditions normalize, so will our dividend.” Vornado president and chief financial officer Michael J. Franco said that the quarter’s financial results were expected to be down from the previous year due to “items previously forecasted,” notably recent vacancies at several Manhattan office properties. “This decrease was primarily attributable to lower [net-operating income] from known move-outs, largely at 770 Broadway, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 280 Park Avenue, and higher net interest expenses, both of which we have previously discussed,” said Franco. Those move-outs included Facebook parent company meta dropping 275,000 square feet at 770 Broadway when its lease expires this year. However, Vornado got a break as it announced Tuesday that NYU agreed to master-lease the entire 1.1 million-square-foot office portion of the Broadway building. But both Roth and Franco pointed to encouraging leasing and occupancy numbers to make the case that the REIT’s office-heavy business model has finally turned the corner after several years of post-COVID uncertainty. Roth reported that year-to-date leasing reached 2.5 million square-feet company-wide, including 2.1 million square feet in Manhattan. He said that he’s confident the firm will reach between 3.5 million and 3.8 million square feet of leases in Manhattan by the end of the year, which would be the second-highest annual amount in the firm’s history, with “the highest starting rents ever.” “Activity is robust,” said Roth. “No new supply always begets a landlord’s market. Our rents are going up, I’m extremely optimistic, and the stock market seems to agree.” Vornado’s stock price opened at $42.81 on Tuesday, up from the $22.88 it sat at on Nov. 6, 2023. Aside from the NYU deal, Roth and Franco highlighted several other large leasing transactions in the firm’s Manhattan portfolio. Vornado leased 740,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, including 297,000 square feet that Google renewed at 85 10th Avenue and leasing totals of 70,000 square feet of space at Penn 1, with an average starting rent of $119 per square foot. The NYU deal at 770 Broadway includes an upfront payment of prepaid rent that will allow Vornado to pay off its $700 million loan on the property, according to Roth. All told, the firm leased 2 million square feet in New York City across 68 transactions in the first nine months of 2024, with average starting rent of $112 per square foot, according to Franco. “The tide has clearly shifted in the New York, Class-A office market: leasing activity is strong and gaining momentum and availability are declining, particularly for large blocks of space,” said Franco. Vornado reported office occupancy of 87.5 percent in the third quarter, down from 89.3 percent in the previous quarter. Franco blamed the expiration of Meta’s lease at 770 Broadway for the small decline, but stated that the NYU master lease at the same office building will bring the firm’s office occupancy up to 90.8 percent by January. He also said vacant space at the newly opened Penn 2 has impacted occupancy levels, but that will also only be temporary. “The easiest money we can make is filling up our empties. As occupancy rises, earnings will go up,” he said. “Our office occupancy will likely decrease in the first quarter 2025, and as vacant space at Penn 2 is placed into service, we anticipate that this decrease will be temporary, and as Penn 2 stabilizes we get to 93 [percent occupancy].” Vornado also announced its portfolio’s retail occupancy rates stand at 78 percent, but Roth argued that excluding Manhattan mall vacancies brings the firm’s retail occupancy closer to 90 percent. “So, actually, we’re pretty well leased in above-the-market occupancies,” he said. “There is strong demand in retail and retail is certainly in much better shape than it was a couple of years ago.” The firm said it carries liquidity of $2.6 billion, with $1 billion cash on its balance sheet. “We are in a very strong capital position,” said Roth. “Our single focus is in creating value, being financially disciplined, and getting our stock price up to where we think the value is and where it should be. “In order to do that, we need to keep leasing, keep improving our balance sheet, and cutting out assets we don’t want, turning them into cash, and continue to work on the very significant and great asset pool we currently have,” he added. “But, actually, I’m all about the stock price.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: British Pension Fund Joins Bitcoin Rush, Invests 3% Of Its Total Assets In BTC
URL: https://zycrypto.com/british-pension-fund-joins-bitcoin-rush-invests-3-of-its-total-assets-in-btc/
Time Published: 2024-11-05T18:28:53Z

In a major adoption boost for Bitcoin, a United Kingdom-based pension fund has added the bellwether crypto to its balance sheet — marking the first move of its kind in the nation. According to pension advisory firm Cartwright, the undisclosed fund made a 3% allocation to the apex cryptocurrency. Pensions specialist Cartwright announced Monday that it had successfully guided an unnamed client in the UK to make a considerable investment into Bitcoin. In October, the client in question allocated 3% of its £50 million ($65 million) to BTC after “lengthy consultations with the scheme’s trustees, where ESG, investment case, and security were all addressed at length,” Glenn Cameron, head of digital assets at Cartwright told Corporate Advisor. What makes this investment particularly noteworthy is that the pension fund is actually investing in Bitcoin itself rather than a proxy such as a spot BTC ETF. The report reveals that the private key is divided between five separate institutions. Cartwright said it had made the recommendation owing to Bitcoin’s long-term returns. According to CoinGecko data, the top crypto has soared by almost 100,000% since 2013. According to Sam Roberts, the firm’s director of investment consulting, Bitcoin is well suited to the scheme’s 10-year investment horizon. “Trustees are increasingly looking for innovative solutions to future-proof their schemes in the face of economic challenges,” Roberts posited. This Bitcoin allocation is a strategic move that not only offers diversification but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile.” Roberts further said he hoped the “strategic move” would be emulated by others. “We are proud to have led this groundbreaking move,” he declared, “which we hope will be the start of a trend for institutional investors in the UK to catch up with their increasing number of peers and competitors around the world who are already taking advantage of Bitcoin’s unique attributes.” Cartwright further stated that it anticipates institutional Bitcoin adoption to be similar to when pension schemes started purchasing equities in the 1970s. It might be painfully slow at first, but then, ultimately, it would become a bad idea not to allocate the asset to a portfolio. Cameron also believes that Bitcoin’s unique asymmetric return profile indicates that even a small allocation can considerably improve financial performance. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has skyrocketed across the globe, specifically in the United States, following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s historic greenlighting of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. These novel investment vehicles allow traditional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency through stock-like shares on regulated exchanges without the hassle of storing the asset. The funds were introduced by Wall Street giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, and have so far collectively accumulated over 1 million BTC — fast closing in on Satoshi Nakamoto’s stack.

Title: Michigan Becomes First State Pension Fund To Invest In Ethereum ETFs With $10 Million Buy

The State of Michigan Retirement System has disclosed a new holding in Grayscale’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund, becoming the first public pension fund to do so since the ETH-based product commenced trading on U.S. exchanges in July. This strategic move marks a huge step for institutional investment in crypto assets, as the Michigan Retirement System manages roughly $13.6 billion in pension fund assets for state employees. In a 13-F disclosure filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Michigan’s pension fund revealed it has scooped up 460,000 shares in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), valued at approximately $10.07 million, along with an additional 1.1 million worth of shares in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). According to VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, Michigan has now become one of the top five holders of Grayscale’s ETH and ETHE. What’s more interesting is that the Michigan pension fund now owns more Ether than Bitcoin, despite the latter being greenlighted by the securities regulator several months in advance. The move sets Michigan apart as most state pension funds focus mostly on Bitcoin investments. As revealed in its latest SEC filing, the Michigan pension fund continues to hold its Bitcoin investment with 110,000 shares in the ARK 21Shares BTC ETF, worth roughly $7 million. “Not only did Michigan’s pension buy ether ETFs, but they bought more than they did of Bitcoin ETFs, $10 million vs $7 million, this despite BTC being up a ton and ether in the gutter,” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posited in a post on X. “Pretty big win for ether, which could use one.” Following the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, institutional investors have become more comfortable with dipping their toes into the fast-growing asset class. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board made a trailblazing move by picking up a $100 million investment in the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund issued by investment giant BlackRock. Notably, Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis recently sent a letter requesting a report on considering Bitcoin and other digital assets as viable investments for state pension funds. This move signals that more and more states are now eyeing crypto as a viable investment for pension funds.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. As Wall Street awaits the results of the 2024 U.S. election, we're going to revisit one of our favorite trends: analyzing the best stocks to own over a specified period of time. Specifically, we're looking at stocks that tend to outperform November. Sitting third on the list of the 25 best S&P 500 (SPX) stocks to have in your portfolio this month is semiconductor giant Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), which also happens to be an outperformer in the fourth quarter. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, AVGO closed November higher 10 times over the last decade, and averaged an 8% pop. Adding to this bullish setup, Broadcom stock recently came within one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average. Per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, five similar signals were observed in the last three years. AVGO saw a positive one-month return 100% of the time, averaging a 9.4% gain. Last seen 2.3% higher at $172.41, the shares could surge past their Oct. 9 all-time high of $186.42 should both of these historically bullish signals play out. AVGO is already outperforming on a year-to-date and year-over-year basis, up 54.4% and 95.7%, respectively, and have only experienced two monthly losses -- both less than 2% -- over the last 12 months.

Title: Exploring The Career Path From IRO To CFO

Plus: Why Controlling Leases Is Important, Boeing Union Ends Strike, Federal Reserve Has New Economic Data For Rate Decision, Nvidia Becomes Most Valuable Company People are often businesses’ largest expense, but leases—for offices, facilities, equipment and vehicles—are usually not that far behind. According to a recent study from lease management platform Visual Lease, 100% of CFOs are concerned about managing those expenses. Not paying enough attention to leases can weigh down a company’s bottom line, either saddling it with rent and utility payments for facilities it doesn’t need, or not negotiating for lower prices or better deals. CFOs are not very confident in their lease figures, according to the study. It found that just 22% felt good about them—more than the 12% of corporate leaders hired to deal with just real estate and leases. And the study found that just under half of CFOs—48%—rely on old-fashioned manual tracking methods for keeping up with lease agreements. CFOs should prioritize better management of their lease portfolio, which could lead to better reporting and money management. More than half—52%—say sustainability metrics represent the biggest challenge with lease portfolios. As companies are beginning to report on ESG, an easy-to-quantify start is looking at the electricity and water consumption at their facilities, as well as waste management. But almost as many CFOs—49%—are concerned that disorganized lease data will get in the way of making a quick change to respond to new circumstances or opportunities. A closer handle on these agreements can help companies know more about their sustainability metrics and use their money more efficiently. For publicly traded companies, the investor relations staff is an important interface between the company and its relationship with shareholders. Sometimes, those roles are filled by the communications team, but when the team is made up of financial professionals, they have a unique view of the company and what makes it valuable. Michaella Gallina is the VP of IR at H&R Block and the CFO of its affiliated company Wave HQ, and she talked to me about the IRO to CFO career path. A portion of our conversation is later in this newsletter. Pro-union stickers on a pole outside the Boeing Renton Production Facility. After a seven-week strike, factory workers at Boeing accepted the company’s revised contract offer, with 59% of members approving it Monday night. The approximately 33,000 workers will return to their Pacific Northwest jobs within the next week. The new contract gives workers a 38% raise over four years and a combined cash bonus of $12,000—$7,000 as a ratification bonus and $5,000 as a 401(k) account contribution. It does not reinstate the company’s former pension plan. Ending the strike helps Boeing begin to stem financial losses—and could put it on a solid path to turn around after an extremely difficult year. The strike began just over a month after CEO Kelly Ortberg took the helm of the company, which in 2024, had major issues with safety, a plea agreement and settlement for fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, and another labor dispute with its onsite firefighters. It’s unclear how the contract impacts Boeing’s financial picture. Last week, Anderson Economic Group estimated total losses from Boeing’s strike at $9.66 billion, with the aerospace company itself losing $5.5 billion. Quarterly earnings for Boeing were solidly in the red when presented last week, and Ortberg already announced layoffs for 10% of the company. In a statement on Monday, Ortberg said, “There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.” A gold plated seal at the Federal Reserve's building in Washington, D.C. After tough years of runaway inflation, the rate has finally deflated to a level the Federal Reserve sees as normal. According to figures released by the Commerce Department last week, inflation was 2.1% last month, meeting economists’ estimates and bringing inflation to the lowest level since February 2021. Core inflation, which excludes more volatile energy and food costs, was a bit higher—2.7%, above analyst estimates of 2.6%. However, these numbers are likely an accurate data point, unlike employment figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. According to the data, the U.S. added just 12,000 jobs last month, far fewer than expected. However, the rate was skewed by work stoppages caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as the strike of more than 30,000 West Coast Boeing plant workers. The unemployment rate is still 4.1%, unchanged from September and in line with economists’ predictions. The gross domestic product for the third quarter was also down a bit, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. GDP grew at 2.8%, slightly less than economists’ estimate of 3%. However, consumer spending grew at a 3.7% clip, leading analysts to tell the New York Times that the economy is healthy and firing on all cylinders. While these numbers are always significant, they take on outsized importance this week. Not only could they influence who voters choose in Tuesday’s election, but they’re likely to be at the center of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting later this week. The policymaking committee may use the information to lower interest rates. According to CME FedWatch, 95.3% of economists currently expect a 0.25% rate cut from this week’s meeting, while 4.7% expect no change. Forbes contributor Jason Schenker writes that the weak job report makes the rate cut highly likely. Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California. While many of the biggest tech companies reported quarterly earnings last week, the most consequential move came from Nvidia, which isn’t scheduled to release its report until the end of the month. On Monday morning, Nvidia surpassed Apple as the most valuable public company, with a $3.39 trillion market cap. By Monday afternoon, Apple regained the top spot, but Nvidia overtook it again by Tuesday morning. The Friday announcement that Nvidia will replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average boosted its stock, and Apple saw its value fall as Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a major sale of the company’s stock. Apple reported its earnings after markets closed on Thursday, receiving a tepid response from investors. The tech company exceeded expectations, reporting an all-time high of $94.9 billion in sales—estimates were $94.5 billion—and $46.2 billion in iPhone sales—$1 billion over estimates. But share prices fell as the company revealed its net income declined 36% based on an EU ruling about a tax issue, and Chinese sales missed expectations. In other earnings last week, e-commerce behemoth Amazon reported $158.9 billion in net sales in its last quarter—an 11% increase from a year before. Online store and third-party seller services brought in the bulk of the revenues, but its AWS service platform represented the third largest chunk, with nearly $27.5 billion in sales, representing 19% year-over-year growth. Amazon’s stock rallied on its earnings report, boosting founder Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second richest person, behind Elon Musk. Microsoft reported its best-ever quarter in the tech company’s history, smashing expectations—making $24.7 billion net income, over $23.2 billion predicted by analysts and 11% up year-over-year. One of the biggest growth drivers was Microsoft Cloud, which saw $38.9 billion of total revenue, up 22% from a year ago. But by late Thursday morning, Microsoft’s stock was down more than 4%, with investors likely unsatisfied with the company’s revenue guidance for the next quarter. Its stock has not measurably picked up since. Microsoft said that some suppliers are behind schedule, which impacts its outlook, but CEO Satya Nadella expects the supply and demand to match up within the second half of the fiscal year. H&R Block VP of Investor Relations and Wave HQ CFO Michaella Gallina. Investor relations officers play an essential role at publicly traded companies, and some companies are beginning to value their expertise in the company’s worth and value as knowledge that can help make financial decisions. Michaella Gallina has been vice president of investor relations at H&R Block for three and a half years, and she’s also been CFO of Wave HQ—owned by H&R Block but independently operated—for six months. I talked to her about her career path and why IROs can be good CFOs. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity. What do people who are IROs and have worked their way up through the IR side bring to the CFO role that others do not? Gallina: Being an IRO teaches you how to be a steward of value. When you’re an IRO, you understand how your company is valued and why the market gives it the multiple. Your job is to increase the multiple of the stock and communicate that story in a credible way. As A CFO, you have to leverage that knowledge because you have to drive value creation when you’re in the execution seat through both the multiple and business results. And if you understand the multiple and what will get you a premium multiple, you can prioritize your organization’s workflow to those value creation streams. That’s not just in the finance organization. The effective CFO is a strategic thought leader. They can say, ‘Our company is valued in these ways. How can I help the organization align our strategy?’ and, of course, understand the financial implications. Secondly, building trust with teams and stakeholders. The IRO’s most trusted credential is their relationships and trust with their constituents: the sell-side analysts that cover them, their buy-side investors, current and prospective shareholders, as well as their management team. As a CFO, you have to understand how critical trust is across the external and internal groups. If you’ve only had internal relationships, you don’t really understand how important those external relationships are. Another area is managing and messaging in times of crisis. An IR professional adds the most significant amount of value in times of crisis because the relationships they’ve built give credibility to their message of whatever they’re doing about that crisis. It makes the other side believe them versus going, ‘Yeah, nice story, but I’m not really sure.’ Delivering a clear and actual message during this time is one lesson you learn. That’s a big thing to the CFO internally: Keep panic from spreading and get your teams focused on their jobs. What goes along with that is in both roles, you need to be unflappable. You are the spearhead of the whole organization when something goes wrong. You don’t need to go, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m panicking. This is a crisis. Get everybody spun up.’ You need to go, ‘Okay, this happened. Let’s get to work. What are we going to do?’ As an IRO, you do that because you have to tell a story of what the company is doing to calm investors. As the CFO, you have to figure out the action plan, and the bigger piece is you have to make sure [it] will satisfy investors. You might have an action plan, but if you don’t know the Street, and you don’t know the market and how they view you, it might not be aligned. And they might go, ‘That’s what you think you need to do, but it won’t help.’ Or, ‘We don’t buy into it.’ There’s really a chain reaction on that front. On the flip side, is there anything that an IRO does not get in their job that somebody taking a more traditional path to CFO would do? The most effective IROs need to have broader experience within the finance organization. If you come from being a corporate communications professional, you don’t understand valuation. There is a gap in that space right now of those two types of professionals, and you have to teach yourself that. There are lots of Training The Street classes that first-year investment banking analysts take. Overall, one wonderful piece you get as an IRO versus any other finance function is the complete view of the organization, how it works together and how that drives value. If you’re in FP&A, you probably don't understand a multiple valuation because you’re just looking through the P&L, or you might not understand how a ratio you’re calculating is interpreted differently by the buy side than the corporate lens. What advice would you give to somebody working on the IR side interested in eventually being a CFO? Get all the experience you can in every corporate finance role. The bottom line is that experience across the organization and finance makes you a better IRO, first and foremost. The more experience you have, the better story you can tell, and the more prepared you can be to take over the leadership in driving value creation at the company. Secondly, if you don’t have analyst experience, you need to seek that externally [to] help you understand very detailed modeling and valuation across the board.

Title: Nvidia and Apple keep taking turns at the top of the world

Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%) is back on top as the world’s most valuable public company ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The chipmaker’s shares rose around 2.4% on Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.42 trillion and past Apple’s (AAPL+1.85%) market cap of $3.37 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares were up by around 0.4%. Apple was able to defend the top spot at the market close on Monday after Nvidia briefly took over earlier in the day. In late October, Nvidia briefly overtook Apple after a record-setting stock rally, but ended the day below the tech giant. Nvidia will take over Intel’s spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the end of the week. Nvidia passed both Apple and Microsoft (MSFT+0.93%) for the first time in June to become the most valuable public company in the world. Earlier in the month, the chipmaker reached the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. It became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after it reported record fourth-quarter earnings in February. Nvidia’s South Korea-based chipmaking partner SK Hynix saw its shares surge on Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker asked it to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. The U.S. presidential election could have implications for Nvidia and other chipmakers which have come under tightening U.S. restrictions on selling to China under both the Trump and Biden administrations. In October, the head of Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML (ASML+2.44%) said he expects more pressure on U.S. allies to curb chip sales to China. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, said. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” The U.S. finalized restrictions on investments in sensitive technologies in China by U.S. individuals and companies late last month. The rules cover three categories of technology: semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Some investments are banned, while others require notice to the U.S. government.

Group plans to buy company behind Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare Frank Keane also operates Volkswagen dealerships in Dublin Frank Keane Motors plans to buy company behind Co Kildare BMW dealership BMW. Photo: Getty Frank Keane Motors – a BMW dealership for almost 60 years – is planning to buy Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare in a deal that’s likely to be worth well in excess of €20m. If approved by the competition watchdog, it will create a group with turnover easily exceeding €300m a year. Frank Keane Motors has just notified the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) that it intends to buy the entire issued share capital of Pavla Unlimited in Naas. Both companies sell new and used cars and are BMW dealerships, with Conlon & Sons selling the eponymous marque as well as Mini, Jaguar and Land Rover. Frank Keane Motors also sells Volkswagen vehicles and light commercial vehicles. It is also a wholesale distributor of FUSO trucks and MG passenger cars. Today's News in 90 Seconds - November 6th Recent company filings for Pavla – controlled by Ray and Nicholas Conlon - show that last month it issued shares valued at almost €23m to a company called Bonaghmore Holdings. Pavla was only incorporated during the summer. Bonaghmore Holdings is in turn owned by a company called Gledstanes, which was also set up during the summer. The most recent set of publicly available accounts for Bonaghmore Holdings show that it generated sales of €84.8m in the 12 months to the end of August 2023, up from €71.4m a year earlier. The company made a €6.1m pre-tax profit in the 2023 financial year, which compared with almost €6.9m in the previous year. It had shareholder funds of €41.5m at the end of the 2023 financial year. Frank Keane Group is unlimited and does not have to file publicly available accounts. However, its turnover is likely to be north of €250m a year. Founded in 1967, it was awarded the BMW franchise for Ireland that year. It now employs about 300 people. It operates a BMW dealership on the Naas Road in Dublin as well as one on Blackrock in the capital’s southside. It also has a Mini dealership on the Nass Road. The firm has two Volkswagen dealerships, both of which are in Dublin. The CCPC said submissions from third parties in relation to the proposed acquisition of Pavla Unlimited are due by December 13 as part of its preliminary investigation in the deal.

Title: Hims & Hers will start selling a generic weight loss drug
URL: https://qz.com/hims-hers-liraglutide-glp1-weight-loss-ozempic-1851689645
Time Published: 2024-11-05T15:50:55Z
Full Content:
The millennial-skewed telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS+2.05%) announced Monday that it will start offering customers a generic version of liraglutide, an older GLP-1 weight loss drug, next year. The news comes as some patients still struggle to fill prescriptions of the most advanced branded GLP-1 treatments on the market like Zepbound, Wegovy and Ozempic. Hims CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call on Monday that company as already “confirmed a core supplier” for its new offering. Liraglutide is currently sold under the brand name Saxenda by Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.05%) and many of its patents have already expired. In a 56-week-long clinical trial, the once-daily injection helped most patients lose over 5% of their weight. For comparison, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+2.10%) weekly-injectable Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks during a clinical trial. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. Newer versions of these treatments, like Wegovy and Ozempic, have become highly sought after because of their effectiveness at treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have had difficulty getting their hands on these popular medications. When a medication is in shortage, which Eli Lilly’s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy have been for most of the year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows pharmacies to make compounded, or altered, versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight loss drugs during recent shortages. A generic liraglutide offering will provide Hims customers more options as these shortages start to end. The company started selling compounded weight loss drugs this year. Earlier this month, the FDA marked the shortage of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, as resolved. Eli Lilly quickly started sending cease-and-desist letters to companies selling copycat versions. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association filed a lawsuit in Texas against the FDA, challenging its decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, obtained by Ars Technica, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” In a court filing, the FDA said pharmacists could resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list. The FDA also recently updated its drug shortage database to show that the all doses of Novo Nordisk’s weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic are now available. However, the drugs continue to be considered in shortage for now as the agency and Novo Nordisk work to ensure a steady supply. Hims chief financial officer Yemi Okupe told Yahoo Finance that company is hearing from customers that they are still finding it difficult to find branded GLP-1s on pharmacy shelves. “In our view, we do still see that the medications are on shortage,” Okupe said. “What consumers are telling us resoundingly is that they are struggling to get access to name-brand GLP-1 medications over the last two months.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Longtime crypto bull Anthony Pompliano believes that the flagship digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) is gold on steroids. In a new interview on Fox Business, the founder of venture capital firm Pomp Investments says that the debasement of the US dollar is bullish for both Bitcoin and gold, but the flagship crypto asset could outperform the precious metal due to increasing adoption. “If you look at gold and the S&P 500 over the last five years, the compound annual growth rate is about the same. Gold is up 13% and the S&P is up 14%. Bitcoin has destroyed that. And so I like to say that Bitcoin is gold with wings. Bitcoin and gold both go up for the same reason. They’re debasing the dollar. But Bitcoin is much more sensitive. It’s an earlier asset that the world is trying to price in. What’s very unique about Bitcoin is that it’s a bottom-up story. Most technology goes top-down. Militaries and governments, they adopt it first, then corporations and then finally individuals. They get a smartphone or they get a computer on their desk. They’re the last ones. Bitcoin was the opposite. The individuals got it first. Now we’re seeing corporations and financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity start to adopt this. Eventually, it’s going to be central banks and it is going to be governments. Central banks today own 12% of the global gold supply. I believe that they will eventually start to buy Bitcoin. That would be very bullish for the price of Bitcoin.” He also believes that people will increasingly store their wealth in stablecoins and Bitcoin instead of a traditional bank account. “If you think of the traditional financial system, you have a checking account, you got a savings account. That checking account is being replaced by stablecoins. It’s just dollars in a digital rail. Bitcoin is becoming that savings account and the beauty of a savings account is you put your money there and you don’t move it. So if you go and you look on-chain, you can see that more than one out of every two Bitcoin has not moved in the last two years, and two out of every three Bitcoin has not moved in the last 12 months even though Bitcoin’s price has tripled during that time period.” Bitcoin is trading for $67,694 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

Title: Amazon begins delivering certain products via drone in Phoenix | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A few months after ending its drone-based delivery program, Prime Air, in California, Amazon says that it’s begun making deliveries to select customers via drone in Phoenix, Arizona. Starting today, Amazon customers in the West Valley Phoenix Metro Area have access to a drone-deliverable selection from Amazon’s catalog, including household, beauty, office, health, and tech supplies. Products must weigh five pounds or less to be eligible; Amazon says about 50,000 are available at launch. Customers can choose the drone delivery location for their address before they check out. Most can expect to receive items in an hour max, according to Amazon, delivered direct from the take-off site in Tolleson. An Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that drone delivery will be available during the daylight hours and “favorable” weather conditions. “Currently we do not offer drone delivery at night, during heavy winds, or during heavy rain,” they added. “Customers in designated delivery area within a radius of our site can get a drone delivery … We’ll inform customers when drone delivery is live in their area.” Amazon’s using its latest drone for deliveries, the MK30, which was recently approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly beyond the visual line of sight of drone operators. Amazon claims the MK30 can fly twice as far as its previous drone, is about 50% quieter to the human ear, and is built to fly in rainy weather. Amazon has also started to deploy the MK30 to make deliveries in College Station, Texas, where the company has been testing drone-based prescription medicine deliveries since 2023. Amazon’s drone delivery efforts have faced a number of setbacks, from complaints over noise to regulatory hurdles and layoffs. Widespread cost-cutting efforts by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have also stymied the service’s progress. To set the stage for easier — and presumably less expensive — deployments, Amazon says it’s now integrating its drone systems into its same-day delivery network instead of building standalone facilities. Amazon previously said that it would bring its drone delivery offerings to the U.K. and Italy by the end of 2024. The company gave no update on those plans today.

83 workers were fired by Grindr When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed a formal complaint against LGBTQ dating app Grinder over its enforcement of a return-to-office policy, which it alleges was only enacted to retaliate against the formation of a workers’ union. According to the report, Grindr terminated the contracts of “about 83 employees” after they failed to comply with the new RTO mandate. However, the workers were allegedly only given two weeks to relocate to a designated hub city or resign. The NLRB’s investigation was triggered by six unfair labor practice charges filed in August, representing workers in California, Nevada and Hawaii. Grindr’s relocation requirements were notably challenging for many workers given the short notice period. Trans employees were among the most affected, being that many faced struggles to locate alternative healthcare in sufficient time. The dating app denies the accusations, describing them as “meritless” and arguing that the union activity only emerged after the company announced its RTO policy. The union added: “In response, Grindr management hired notorious union-busting Littler Mendelson and quickly established a retaliatory return-to-office (RTO) policy.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! More broadly, Grindr’s efforts to get workers back into the office reflects an industry-wide trend in the tech sector. Companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have all reduced the amount of time that workers have at home, but criticism always arises accusing companies of using these policies to encourage resignations and reduce the need for layoffs. If Grindr can’t come to an agreement, the case will be heard by an administrative law judge in March 2025. The union, Grindr United-CWA, commented: “Today’s complaint from the NLRB is another huge victory for our union.” Grindr did not immediately respond to TechRadar Pro’s request for a comment.

Title: University A.I. Programs See Massive Enrollment Surges Thanks to ChatGPT
URL: https://observer.com/2024/11/university-ai-programs-witnessing-massive-enrollment-surges/
Time Published: 2024-11-05T13:00:58Z

In 2018, the University at Buffalo became one of the first schools in the world to establish a master’s program focused on A.I. The technology “wasn’t a big craze” at the time, Kemper Lewis, dean of the university’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, told Observer, with the program’s enrollment seen as “slow and steady for a little while.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The program is classified as a Master of Science in Engineering Science with a focus on A.I. and provides a foundational background in A.I. and relevant subsets like machine learning, deep learning and advanced artificial neural networks. The degree opened for enrollment in the spring of 2020 and counted five students in its inaugural semester. That number has since risen more than twentyfold, with the university counting 103 students in the program this fall. “It was a great investment now that we look back on it,” said Lewis. A portion of this surge can be attributed to the mainstream breakthrough of A.I. following the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, said Lewis, who noted a “decent jump” in enrollment in connection to the chatbot’s release. But the program’s more significant surges occurred in relation to local initiatives like Empire A.I., a $400 million statewide research consortium unveiled by New York Governor Kathy Hochul earlier this year. The University at Buffalo is part of the new public-private research center and plans to build an A.I. supercomputing center on campus valued at $250 million. “I think there’s a lot of Google searches going on right now about A.I. degrees, Buffalo, and they’re finding our master’s program from all over the world,” said Lewis. The University at Buffalo isn’t the only school embracing A.I. into its degree programs. Schools like Carnegie Mellon, Purdue University and MIT were also early adopters, while the University of Pennsylvania earlier this year made history as the first Ivy League school to offer an undergraduate degree and a subsequent master’s in A.I. Carnegie Mellon, which established its A.I. undergraduate degree in 2018, has also seen a rise in interest. While its 2019 enrollment totaled 53, the program has reliably counted more than 100 students annually since 2021. Oregon State University’s graduate A.I. program grew from 15 students in its inaugural 2021 class to 62 last fall, and MIT’s A.I.-related undergraduate major counted 300 students this year compared to just 37 in 2022. A.I.-related undergraduate and master’s degree conferrals have risen by 120 percent since 2011, according to a 2023 report from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, while A.I.-related Ph.D. conferrals have increased by 33 percent during that time. At the University at Buffalo, the school’s A.I. degree takes between 12 to 18 months to complete and has sent off alumni to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon Web Services and Salesforce. The school is in the process of bolstering the program through initiatives like Advancing Top 25: Faculty Hiring, which has helped add more than 200 faculty members researching A.I. Such research is needed as the program’s subject matter continues to shift, according to Lewis. “We’re constantly working on improving the degree and making sure it continues to be relevant,” he said. Lewis added that its efforts are starting to pay off as people grasp the relevance of A.I. and begin perceiving it as a valuable sector in higher education. “I think students around the world are starting to realize, okay, this is here to stay,” he said.

Title: What's Happening With Google Stock?

Google logo sign is seen outiside Google office in Krakow, Poland on October 19th, 2024. (Photo by ... [+] Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) saw a marginal growth of over 1% last week, despite it reporting a solid quarter. The company reported revenue of $88.3 billion and earnings of $2.12 per share, both metrics well above the consensus estimates of $86.3 billion and $1.85, respectively. The increased demand for AI solutions drove the growth for the company. However, much of the positives appears to be priced in for its stock. In this note, we discuss the key takeaways from Alphabet’s results, its stock performance, and valuation. Also, check out should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold Amazon? Google’s revenues of $88.3 billion in Q3 reflected a 15% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 35% to $11.4 billion. Google search revenue was up 12% to $49.4 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 12% to $8.9 billion y-o-y. The company’s self-driving car unit — Waymo — is now seeing 150,000 weekly paid rides. Waymo could be the next big thing for Google. See how Waymo could be worth $5 trillion. Not only did Alphabet see its revenue rise, its operating margin expanded 450 bps y-o-y to 32.3% in Q3. Higher revenue and margin expansion led to a 37% rise in the bottom line to $2.12 per share. Looking forward, we expect the company to post revenue of $96 billion in Q4, and earnings to be around $2.15 per share. While Alphabet’s results were solid, its stock price appears to have little room for growth, in our view. We estimate Google’s valuation to be $182 per share, reflecting only 6% upside from its current levels of over $170. Our forecast is based on 23x expected earnings of $8.05 per share in 2024. The 23x figure is higher than the stock average P/E ratio of 18x seen over the last three years. GOOG stock is trading at a multiple lower than some of its peers, with META trading at 26x and AMZN at 40x forward expected earnings. That is because there remains a key risk for Alphabet. Google is facing antitrust cases, alleging the company to monopolize the marketplace and the general search services. The remedies could include a breakup of the company, which seems unlikely for now, regulatory oversight, and restrictions on businesses, among others. None of these would bode well for Alphabet’s businesses in the long term. As such, despite a strong growth visibility in the cloud business, on the back of AI demand, and continued ad revenue gains, we think that the stock may not see any meaningful growth in the near term. GOOG stock has seen over 20% gains this year, broadly aligning with the returns for the S&P500 index. However, the change in GOOG stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for GOOG stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While GOOG stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Google’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons. Separately, look at what’s happening with META stock.

Title: ‘I could have been dead’: Food delivery driver in shock after being attacked in Cork

As he recovers from the surgery he underwent on Friday to reconstruct the broken bones in his left leg, Brazilian delivery rider Alexandre Athos Pinheiro Teixeira (23) is still in shock after being chased then rammed as he worked in Cork on Halloween night. Shortly before midnight Mr Teixeira, who also studies English in Ireland, had just completed a delivery on his motorbike in the Blackrock area of the city when he noticed a grey car stopping and reversing in his direction. “I thought someone had gone the wrong way or something, that’s normal. I swerved to avoid the car,” he says. Moments later, when he tried to overtake it, however, he was suddenly attacked by a man “wearing a mask and a bandanna. The car’s back door opened, and a person jumped out of the car towards me. “I thought: ‘Wow, I’m going to get robbed,’ or something like that, but I still didn’t know if it was a Halloween prank. And I sped up. Then the person tried to pull me but he couldn’t. I sped up and left. “I thought they were going to leave me alone at that point, but they didn’t. My motorbike isn’t very fast and their car was much faster. So, when they caught up to me, I braked and turned back to try to lose them.” To try to escape, Mr Teixeira entered a residential area but he was caught as he tried to make a sudden turn. “They knocked me off the motorcycle with the car, but at that moment I hadn’t been hurt yet. I was fine,” he says. The same attacker who had earlier jumped out of the car emerged from the vehicle again. “I started screaming: ‘Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me?’” The man started swinging punches in the direction of Mr Teixeira, who sought to hit him back. “I managed to punch him and he got back in the car,” he says. He was then caught off guard for a moment and the driver accelerated towards him. “This part is a kind of a blur in my mind, but I remember my leg cracking. I think it got between the fender (mudguard) of my motorcycle and the bumper of the car,” Mr Teixeira said. [ Gardaí recover stolen car used to ram Deliveroo driver (23) in alleged road rage incidentOpens in new window ] The occupants of the car left the scene, abandoning their victim who was lying trapped by his motorbike with severe compound fractures in his left leg. “If I had landed on my hip,” he says, “I could have been in a wheelchair. If I had landed on my head near the car, I could have been dead. They would have killed me.” Mr Teixeira told The Irish Times he managed to call an emergency group of delivery workers and send them his location. “They came to where I was and helped me,” he says. Residents also heard the collision and discovered the victim in severe pain on the street and called emergency assistance. He was brought to Cork University Hospital, where he underwent surgery. “I think it’ll be a few months of recovery,” he says. Mr Teixeira says he saw a man driving the car, a woman front passenger, and another man in the back. All were in their 20s, he believes. Gardaí recovered a stolen Skoda Kodiaq – believed to have been used to ram Mr Teixeira – burnt out in a field in Carrignavar, 12km north of Cork city, early on Friday morning and have begun a technical examination of the vehicle. The same car is believed to have rammed a Garda vehicle at about 2am on the Old Mallow Road on the northside of the city, about 8km from the scene of the hit and run. Two gardaí were treated for minor injuries at the scene. Gardaí suspect that the occupant or occupants of the stolen Skoda Kodiaq were collected by a driver in another car. Gardaí have requested witnesses or anyone with footage of either incident to contact them at Anglesea Street station at 021 452 000 or the Confidential Line at 1800 666 111. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Will Wall Street allow Big Tech to make AI work?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over – at least when it comes to the stock market and investors. In the past few months, we have seen the value of chip companies that have positioned themselves in the AI sector soar. Nvidia has overtaken Intel, a situation that might once have been unthinkable. Newcomers such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been making inroads into the market, attracting significant valuations from investors. And it seems that anyone who is anyone is getting involved in AI in some way. If there was any doubt that AI was attracting big money, a look at the most recent round of quarterly results should have put that to bed. Last week, several of the largest tech companies – Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS – revealed increased spending on the technology as they each try to capitalise on the interest in AI. But there is more to come. Big tech companies are planning to spend even more in building their AI arsenal into next year, and hoping to persuade customers to adopt it at scale. The question is, will Wall Street give them the space to do it? Lest we forget, it is not too long ago that the same companies that are investing heavily in their AI capabilities were telling their staff that they needed to cut their cloth to fit the new economic reality, at the mercy of fluctuating share price. That new economic reality seems to include the shiny new AI toys, for which tech companies seem prepared to offer deep budgets. If the promise of AI is realised, then the billions ploughed into developing the technology will be seen as a sensible investment. But if not, it won’t be the first time that a much-hyped new technology fails to live up to the forecasts. Fully autonomous cars, which have been in development for years, have yet to reach any sort of meaningful market. NFTs promising a new wave of artists revenue, selling for outrageous sums, have fallen out of favour. And lets not forget the world of crypto. For now, Wall Street is watching, nervously. If there is a hint of the technology not reaching its potential, the money that has flowed in to AI companies could just as quickly flow out.

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: The presale of DTX Exchange is capturing market interest as it has managed to raise just over $6.5 million and plans to integrate DEX and CEX elements within its independent Layer-1 blockchain. Providing up to 1000x more liquidity than most existing cryptocurrencies, DTX is designed to facilitate both crypto and traditional financial operations, without the need for additional blockchains. According to analysts, listing the Binance would significantly have an impact on the price of DTX through the roof as a 1 ETH investment opportunity. However, BTC and ETH have painted a bullish picture if key support levels are intact, such as what we see Bitcoin is currently trading below the realized price and ETH is good for a short-term up move. Bitcoin Struggles Below Realized Price, Testing Market Support It is currently priced at $68,608 below the realized price of $69,352 thus slowing down the chances of a bounce back to $72,000. Hitherto, prices tested below the realized price imply that the amount of selling pressures is bearish, therefore depressing the market. Although prices managed to go slightly above this level in the past, the Bitcoin price has been struggling and recently fell below this level as market participants wonder how low the price of BTC could go. According to a recent analysis, it explained that if the price manages to hold the $69K, then it could surge to $78K. However, the prolonged trading below the realized price gives the impression that the company’s stock has more downside than upside in the current bear market. Bitcoin has gained 60% of the market share recently, proving it is back from the aggressiveness of the altcoin season this past year. Ethereum At Risk For Bearish Pressure Though Short-Term Trades Pose Possible Potential The Ethereum is currently trading at around $2,516 and seems to face incredible levels of resistance, with some analysts already predicting a downward trend. ETH is expected to reach a level of $1,551 if the bearish trend persists according to analysts, and traders. The analyst considers $1,551 as another ‘break even’ level for the Ethereum holders and believes that such a price level may lead to further erosion of confidence.

In a 13-F disclosure filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the state fund revealed it has picked up $10 million worth of shares from Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE). What’s surprising is that the fund now owns more Ethereum than Bitcoin, despite the latter being approved first by the securities regulator many months in advance. Monday’s records show the fund scooped a further $1.1 million worth of shares from the digital asset manager’s Ethereum Mini Trust. It also marks the first U.S. state pension fund to invest in Ethereum ETFs, providing crypto enthusiasts with confidence the asset is becoming more entrenched in the traditional financial world. It follows the fund’s recent purchase of $6.6 million worth of ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF in July, which followed the SEC's regulatory approval of the asset class for the investment vehicle in January. ETHE represents a fractional ownership of Ethereum held by Grayscale on behalf of the trust’s shareholders. Each share gives indirect exposure to the performance of Ethereum without the need for direct ownership. ETHE has experienced significant net outflows since its conversion to an ETF in July 2024. On its first trading day, Grayscale’s flagship Ethereum fund saw outflows of $484 million, and by early August, total outflows had exceeded $2 billion, data from SoSoValue shows. The launch of multiple spot US-based Ethereum ETFs by firms this year, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise, has all but intensified competition, particularly when it comes to fees. While ETHE charges 2.5%, rivals BlackRock (ETHA) and Fidelity (FETH) are expected to charge 0.12% and 0.25% following the expiration of their fee waiver slated for December 31.

Key Highlights -Impact on India Pharmaceuticals: Indian generic drug exports to the US may face tariff revisions, potentially affecting the pharmaceutical sector. IT Sector: A slowdown in US discretionary spending due to trade wars could negatively impact India’s IT exports. FPIs: If US interest rate cuts are delayed, FPI inflows into India could diminish, as there is an inverse relationship between US interest rates and FPI flows into emerging markets. India’s Monetary Policy: Any delay in US rate cuts could also delay India’s repo rate cuts, prolonging pressures on the Indian economy, which is already seeing a slowdown in earnings growth. “A Trump victory should ideally flag off the next leg of US market dominance over the global markets. It would also contribute to an accompanying rise in bond market yields, particularly the 10-year Treasury. A stronger US bond yield would exacerbate the capital outflows from the Indian markets triggering another cruel spell of drawdowns. Additionally, we could see a pronounced comeback of the protectionist tendencies, which we first glimpsed in Trump’s last stint as the US President. Between 2017 and 2020, the denial rate of H-1B visas ramped up putting IT companies in a fix. With Trump coming to power, there could be employee and workflow disruptions leading to transitory, minor dents in the top lines of IT companies. However, the symbolic posturing behind the move will be sobering for a country like India, with a massive workforce looking to market their skill overseas. If the democratic nominee Kamala Harris comes to power, it would be a non-factor, essentially an extension of the policies of the incumbent President Joe Biden.” Bank Nifty opened today’s session with a gap-down at 51,053 versus yesterday’s close of 51,215.

Additionally, when comparing growth rates with December 2023, deposit growth has continued to outpace credit offtake. Credit offtake increased by 8.0% compared to December 2023, reaching Rs 172.4 lakh crores as of October 18, 2024. Mortgages and MSMEs account for the bulk of this increase. However, the growth slowdown compared to last year can be attributed to a higher base effect due to the merger and RBI measures such as higher risk weights and the proposed LCR norms. Deposits rose at 8.6% compared to December 2023, reaching Rs 218.1 lakh crore as of October 18, 2024. This growth can be attributed to rising term deposit rates of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs). The Short-term Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) has decreased to 6.43% as of October 18, 2024, compared to 6.74% as of October 27, 2023, indicative of surplus liquidity.

The Global Methane pledge was adopted in COP26 and countries that were part of the pledge agreed to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. A number of National Oil companies globally have joined the OGMP 2.0 framework and are also part of the Oil and Gas Climate initiative. Cairn’s entry into this very elite club of companies which have adopted the OGMP framework will mean regular (annual) reporting on emissions and potentially a commitment to reach Level 5 reporting (most rigorous reporting) within a 3-5 year timeframe. This should encourage industry peers in India to also consider adopting the framework and moving towards higher quality of reporting of methane emissions. 👉Net profit up 21.4% at ₹440.5 cr vs ₹363 cr

Pensions advisory firm Cartwright announced Monday that it had told an unnamed client in the UK to make a 3% allocation to the leading cryptocurrency. The firm said that it made the recommendation because of Bitcoin’s long-term gains. The cryptocurrency has risen in price by nearly 100,000% since 2013, CoinGecko data shows. “Trustees of the unnamed scheme choose to make a 3% Bitcoin allocation, reflecting the scheme’s relatively long investment time horizon,” the announcement said. Cartwright’s director of investment consulting at Cartwright, Sam Roberts, said that he hoped the “strategic move” would be followed by others. “We are proud to have led this groundbreaking move,” he said, “which we hope will be the start of a trend for institutional investors in the UK to catch up with their increasing number of peers and competitors around the world who are already taking advantage of Bitcoin’s unique attributes.” Cartwright said it expects institutional adoption of Bitcoin to be similar to when pension schemes started buying equities in the 1970s: It may be slow at first, but then eventually will seem like a bad idea to not allocate the asset to a portfolio. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has grown around the world—but particularly in the U.S.—following the January approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The funds allow investors to buy exposure to the cryptocurrency via stock-like shares that trade on regulated exchanges. Major Wall Street players including BlackRock and Fidelity launched the funds, and have so far collectively snapped up over 1 million Bitcoin—or $67 billion worth at today’s prices Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks slipped during a jittery session on Monday to kick off a week of potentially huge market-moving events — the presidential election and the Federal Reserve policy decision. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by about the same amount. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, falling about 250 points, or 0.6%. Monday's session was choppy ahead of Tuesday's election, a big risk event for markets. The new president — whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump — will set the course for the economy in the years that follow. The neck-and-neck race has investors bracing for volatility on Election Day itself. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Weekend polls showed Harris with a shock lead in Iowa and gaining ground elsewhere — a sign the Democrat has a better chance of winning than Wall Street had calculated. The dollar dropped by the most in a month as traders recalculated bets on a Trump victory. Treasury yields also retreated, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) sliding almost 10 basis points to about 4.30%. Also looming large is the Fed's two-day policy meeting, kicking off a day later than usual on Wednesday in light of the election. Wall Street is convinced that Chair Jerome Powell will usher in a 0.25% rate cut on Thursday, despite signs of stubborn inflation and muddied job market signals. Given that, the focus is on what action the Fed might take at future meetings, with the market now seeing three fewer cuts through the end of 2025 than it previously expected. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards In other markets, oil prices jumped nearly 3% after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, decided to delay a planned hike in output by at least a month and Iran escalated Mideast tensions by warning of a "crushing response" to Israel's strikes. Stocks fell during a choppy trading session on Monday ahead of the US presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down 0.6%, or roughly 270 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed down 0.3% after switching between positive and negative territories throughout the session. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) closed slightly higher but off its session high in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow on Friday. "Trump trades" were volatile during the session, with Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closing out the session 12% higher despite an Iowa poll over the weekend showing his contender, Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of former president Trump. The markets were choppy on Monday as investors braced for Tuesday's US presidential election. Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson made some predictions on which sectors could lead, depending on the outcome. In a Republican sweep scenario, in which Donald Trump wins and his party maintains control of the House and also gains the Senate, cyclicals such as Financials, Industrials, and commodity-sensitive industries could outperform and take the major averages higher, provided Treasury yields stay somewhat contained in the days following the outcome, Wilson and his team said. "Conversely, if the move higher in yields is more material and is driven by a rising term premium due to fiscal sustainability concerns, we would expect more of a risk-off posture like the summer/fall of 2023," Wilson wrote. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins and Congress is divided, Wilson sees "tariff-exposed consumer equities and renewables outperforming in the short term" while Financials, Industrials and commodity-sensitive industries could underperform initially. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 1% to hover around $67,800 on Monday as investors braced for the US presidential election on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency has been viewed as a beneficiary if Donald Trump were to win the White House. The token moved beyond $72,000 last week, only to retreat after an Iowa poll over the weekend showed Vice President Kamala Harris leapfrogging ahead of Trump. The former president has said in the past he will create a "bitcoin national stockpile" if reelected to the White House. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped into green territory by 1:45 p.m Eastern on Monday in what has shaped up to be a choppy session. The tech-heavy index switched between positive and negative since early morning trading. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was helping lift the major average in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) later this week. The AI chip heavyweight climbed more than 2% during the session. Yahoo Finance's Grace Williams reports: The 2024 presidential election is a day away, and with both candidates polling closely, speculation about a second Trump administration now heavily involves Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Specifically, if Musk will head up Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). If that happens, “I think he will still be heavily involved with [Tesla],” Bank of America senior auto analyst John Murphy told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. Read more here. Energy (XLE) stocks outperformed on Monday as crude futures gained more than 2% following a decision by oil alliance OPEC+ to delay an increase in output. Real Estate (XRE) and Materials (XLB) also rose while Utilities (XLU), Financials (XLF) and Healthcare (XLV) dipped. Stocks moved to session lows by mid-session on Monday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropping 0.4% after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Russia plotted to send incendiary devices on planes headed to the US and Canada. The report cited Western officials who said the devices that ignited in Europe were part of a plot to put them on cargo or passenger planes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped from positive to negative territory to drop 0.3% immediately following the report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 400 points, or almost 1%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% Monday as analysts pointed to rising chip sales and mounting spending on AI infrastructure. That jump helped the AI chipmaker reach a $3.40 trillion market cap, according to Yahoo Finance data, again overtaking Apple's (AAPL) roughly $3.35 trillion. Apple shares traded slightly lower midday, down 0.5%. Nvidia had last dethroned Apple a little over a week ago, but Apple briefly retook the crown — before its earnings weighed on the stock. Nvidia's rise comes after a week of ups and downs, as Big Tech's earnings shone a spotlight on AI capital expenditures. Investors fear that spending coud ease in the coming years as infrastructure projects reach completion, weighing on AI chipmakers. Wall Street analysts have largely remained bullish on AI hardware stocks, seeing infrastructure spending by Big Tech continuing to rise. Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill said Monday that they expect Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) to spend a combined $292 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2025, representing an 88% increase from 2023 expenses. Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note Monday that global semiconductor sales grew 7.6% in September — "a bit above typical" — from the prior month. Rasgon said of Nvidia: "The datacenter opportunity is enormous, and still early, with material upside still possible." Peloton (PTON) shares rose 9% on Monday after Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock to a Buy from Neutral amid optimism over the fitness equipment maker's new leadership. "Peloton's new CEO Peter Stern does not have public company CEO experience but meets all the criteria set by Peloton's board" including consumer software and hardware experience and subscription services, the analysts wrote. Stern, an avid Peloton user who comes from Ford (F), will start his CEO role on Jan. 1. Constellation Energy (CEG) stock fell as much as 12% early Monday amid a broader decline in nuclear power stocks following the US government's rejection of another Big Tech nuclear power agreement late Friday. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a proposal from a grid operator, PJM, to ramp up the amount of power supplied through the grid from Talen Energy (TLN) to an Amazon (AMZN) AI data center. Talen said in a statement on Sunday it believes the FERC "erred" in its ruling, adding the company is "evaluating our options, with a focus on commercial solutions." Talen Energy dropped 9% in early trading, while Sam Altman-backed Oklo (OKLO) fell 8%, Centrus Energy (LEU) tumbled 19%, NANO Nuclear (NNE) dropped 10%, Vistra (VST) sank 4%, and NuScale Power (SMR) fell 7%. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Read the full story here. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) fell around 2% in early trading on Monday after initially opening the day in the green. Shares are bracing for another volatile week on Wall Street just one day ahead of the presidential election. The stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday. And since Tuesday, more than $4 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock still has more than doubled from its September lows. Prior to the recent sell-off, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had risen in recent weeks as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican. Read more here. US stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for this week's US elections and a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flat line, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the artificial intelligence chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also gained on Monday amid surging oil prices. Investors are focused on Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential election, as well as on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policymakers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report showed that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs, and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other countries, said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

That was the conclusion of the S&P Dow Jones committee, which decides when changes need to be made to the 30-member index, long viewed as a key barometer of the U.S. economy. After markets closed on Friday, S&P said Intel is out. It's being replaced, on Nov. 8, by rival chipmaker Nvidia, which has ballooned to become the world's second most-valuable public company, just a hair behind Apple as of Monday. With the change, four of the tech industry's six trillion-dollar companies will be in the Dow, with internet giants Alphabet and Meta still on the outside. For those two companies, there are no obvious members to replace. Nvidia, on the other hand, recently leapfrogged Intel as the biggest chipmaker by revenue, creating a clear one-for-one swap opportunity. A defining characteristic of the Dow is that it's a price-weighted index. That means a stock's significance is based on its price and not the market cap of the company. In getting trounced by Nvidia in artificial intelligence while also losing share of its core PC and data center processor market, Intel has seen its stock price plummet by more than half this year, closing on Friday at $23.20. Now, Intel is by far the least-significant member of the Dow, with a weighting of less than 0.5%. The next lowest-priced stock is Verizon at around $41. With Intel being the only chipmaker in the index, the sector is underrepresented relative to its position in the economy. "A big part of the decision is that semis weren't being represented," Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in an interview. "Sector representation and price is important." Nvidia's stock works in the company's favor. On a market cap basis, Nvidia would be worth an outsized 18% of the index, but its stock price will give it just the 21st highest weighting, behind Chevron and ahead of 3M. Nvidia positioned itself to join the Dow in May, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Silverblatt said the technology industry's weighting in the Dow will go up to about 19.5% from 18.9%, even though its market weight will be at around 58%. The bigger weighting change comes with Sherwin-Williams joining the index at the same time and replacing Dow Inc., bringing the materials sector to about 5% from less than 1%, Silverblatt said. As for Alphabet and Meta, the wait could continue for a long while. Amazon joined the Dow in January, giving the internet sector greater representation in the index. Alphabet's position is slightly complicated by the fact that its Class A and Class C stocks are both publicly traded. Meta's price of almost $562 would currently give it the heftiest weighting in the Dow, just ahead of UnitedHealth Group. Given tech's heightened overall representation, there are no obvious moves ahead that would include Silicon Valley's megacaps. "In order to put one in, you have to take one out," Silverblatt said.

Title: Securities disclosure over Cambridge Analytica data breach comes before court
URL: https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/11/securities-disclosure-over-cambridge-analytica-data-breach-comes-before-court/
Time Published: 2024-11-04T20:36:19Z
Full Content:
The justices will return to securities law on Wednesday with arguments in a case arising out of the 2015 Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data breach. The tech giant’s effort to fend off federal securities fraud lawsuits in Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank could narrow the opportunities for private investors to hold companies accountable under federal laws that regulate corporate misconduct. In 2016, the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exploited the data of over 30 million Facebook users in connection with Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. After Facebook (now Meta) knew of the breach, but before Cambridge’s widespread use of the data was made public, Facebook issued a securities filing disclosing to investors the hypothetical risk that a security breach might cause harm to Facebook’s business and stock price. That disclosure did not reveal that, as Facebook was aware, a large breach of that sort already had occurred. Later, when Cambridge’s misuse of the data became widely known, Facebook’s stock price fell precipitously. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Facebook shareholders sued the company for securities fraud, arguing that the disclosures about the risk of a securities breach were misleading because they did not reveal what Facebook knew about the Cambridge breach. A federal district court dismissed their claims, holding that the risk statements were not false or misleading. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed, prompting Facebook to come to the Supreme Court. This is one of those cases – regrettably common – where the parties spend as much of their time bickering about what question is properly before the justices as they do presenting their arguments on the merits. Paring away the contentions about what was and was not argued below and whose position has changed the most over the course of the proceeding, Facebook’s central point is that its disclosure about the hypothetical possibility that a data breach could cause it harm in the future is not misleading, and that the lower court erred in its contrary finding. Specifically, Facebook argues that this kind of disclosure – a forward-looking statement about future risks – should never be regarded as misleading solely because it fails to disclose that the relevant triggering event (in this case, a securities breach) already has occurred and well might cause harm to the company. Here, because nothing in the disclosure was incorrect – it is in fact true that a security breach could harm Facebook and its stock price, as history now teaches us. In short, the company says, Facebook cannot be held liable for what it did not say. The investors reject Facebook’s argument as seeking a categorical rule that gives companies a pass if they make a clearly misleading statement and put it in a forward-looking risk disclosure as opposed to some other part of their filing. From the investors’ perspective, the rule should be the same here as anywhere else; the only relevant question is whether the statement, taken in context, was materially misleading. The only thing that the lower courts held here is that Facebook can be liable if the statement, in context, was materially misleading. The investors, a bank and a public pension plan, are seeking compensation for the lost value of their stock. My guess is that the justices will be frustrated by how little the issues on which the parties discuss in their briefs resemble the question they agreed to review. In an effort to offer something predictive about what we might see at the argument, I would point to two things. The first is a deep-seated skepticism of securities fraud litigation held by some of the justices, who tend to view litigation in this area as akin to extortion based on hindsight. The court has also issued a number of decisions in recent years in favor of corporate interests that have weakened federal regulators, including at the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.05%), the maker of blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, has entered an agreement with Denmark-based Ascendis Pharma (ASND-1.44%) to leverage the latter’s advanced drug delivery technology. The partnership aims to speed up the development of a long-acting, monthly GLP-1 drug. Current GLP-1 medications on the market are administered as once-weekly injections. “Developing potential therapies that can be administered less frequently could benefit societies as well as individual patients, and it is a clear focus area for Novo Nordisk,” Brian Vandahl, senior vice president of global research technologies at Novo Nordisk, said in a press release. “We look forward to working with Ascendis to explore the potential of the TransCon technology platform to reduce the dosing frequency of GLP-1 receptor agonists and other treatments for cardiometabolic diseases.” GLP-1 treatments are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. Demand for these medications has transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+2.10%), the producer of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Viking Therapeutics is also developing a monthly GLP-1 weight-loss drug. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Under the deal, Novo Nordisk has secured the exclusive worldwide license to use Ascendis’ TransCon technology platform to develop, produce, and sell products for metabolic diseases, including obesity and Type 2 diabetes with the primary goal being to develop a monthly GLP-1. Ascendis could receive up to $285 million in total payments for this leading drug program, covering upfront fees, development, and regulatory milestones. The company will also be eligible for sales-based milestone payments and royalties on global net sales. For each additional product candidate targeting metabolic or cardiovascular diseases, Ascendis could earn up to $77.5 million. Ascendis will handle the initial development of TransCon-based product candidates, with Novo Nordisk covering these early development costs. Novo Nordisk will also take charge of clinical development, regulatory approvals, large-scale manufacturing, and commercialization.

Perplexity, an AI search company, wants you to use artificial intelligence to track election results. The company launched its Election Information Hub on Friday to offer AI-generated answers to questions you have about elections. The hub provides summaries of candidates and their policies — with somewhat vague descriptions — and offers information about local ballot initiatives. “People deserve a clear, easy way to find the information they seek, and few topics are as consequential as elections,” the company said in a statement. “We want to do our part to support an informed electorate, so we’ve built the election hub on Perplexity’s answer engine: an entry point for understanding key issues, voting intelligently, and tracking election results.” The company told The Verge it’s partnering with the Associated Press and Democracy Works to gather its data, and Perplexity cites Wikipedia in many of its entries. “We selected domains that are non-partisan and fact-checked, including Ballotpedia and news organizations. We’re actively monitoring our systems to ensure that we continue to prioritize these sources when answering election-related queries,” Perplexity’s spokesperson said. The company, which has backing from Jeff Bezos and Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%), has previously been accused in a WIRED investigation of: making things up, often inaccurately summarizing topics, and even attributing fake quotes to real people. WIRED dubbed the site a “bullshit machine.” But Perplexity believes its election hub will not have similar problems. “We want to make it as simple as possible to receive trusted, easy-to-understand information to inform your voting decisions,” the company said. “For each response, you can view the sources that informed an answer, allowing you to dive deeper and verify referenced materials.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Lex: Warren Buffett’s Apple trade exposes Berkshire’s dilemma

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Lex is the flagship investment column of the Financial Times and has published in the newspaper since 1945. OPINION What is the next great investment idea? And what are the chances that Warren Buffett will be the person to identify it? Wall Street likes his odds. Shares in the class B of Berkshire Hathaway are up 25% so far in 2024. And the rally comes as Buffett has been rapidly paring back his blockbuster win in Apple stock. On Saturday Berkshire Hathaway reported its third-quarter results, most notably that its cash and marketable securities balance had swelled to $325 billion (NZ$543.9b). A big chunk of that has come from share sales of Apple whose value for Berkshire now stands at $70b, down from a peak of $178b. Berkshire invested initially in Apple in 2016 when its share price was around $25 a share. Today Apple trades above $200. Berkshire’s total book value through the third quarter was $631b, while its public equity market capitalisation is just shy of $1 trillion. That premium to net asset value reflects a vote of confidence from shareholders that Buffett, at 94, has another similar masterstroke in him. Buffett for now, however, is increasingly content to clip US Treasury coupons earning a few percentage points, risk free, with no dividends or real buybacks for Berkshire shareholders. It comes as other big pools of capital – alternative asset managers as well as BlackRock – are pouring funds into all types of plain and exotic private credit as well as long-tailed infrastructure and data centre deals. Blackstone, for example, has deployed $123b in the past 12 months mostly away from either public or even private equity. To be sure, Berkshire’s property and casualty insurance business carries out all sorts of sophisticated trading and hedging activities. But the investment group is best known for largely buying public, large-cap equities as well as mega operating business platforms such as power utilities and railroads. In the absence of a financial markets crisis where Buffett could play white knight to handsome reward, there is a question in calm markets if he needs to choose less vanilla securities. The sheer size of Berkshire now makes it hard to find single investments that can move the needle. Its securities portfolio of more than $300b has fewer than 30 stocks and the next Apple probably needs to be an up-and-coming Big Tech luminary. Buffett’s Apple bonanza helped obscure the dearth of juicy opportunities for Berkshire. That dilemma is now back on the table. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: World stocks tread water ahead of crunch US election

European and US stocks fell flat on Monday as investors treaded carefully before the US presidential election that will impact the world economy, with a US Federal Reserve interest rate cut also expected later in the week. In the US presidential race, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump remain virtually tied in opinion polls ahead of Tuesday’s vote. It might not be clear who has won for days after voting ends. Mr Trump’s policies on immigration, tax cuts and tariffs may put upward pressure on inflation, bond yields and the dollar, analysts believe, while Harris is seen as the continuity candidate. “We are too evenly divided and polarised to suggest a red sweep,” Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “The Senate looks like it will swing Republican, but the presidency and the house are simply too close to call,” he said. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe added 0.3 per cent , while the dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of currencies, eased 0.29 per cent to 103.63. Iseq heavyweight Ryanair traded flat (remaining at €18) despite a court ruling pausing the effects of a Dublin Airport passenger cap that was due to imminently affect airlines’ access to take-off and landing slots over the summer 2025 period. The airline along with rival Aer Lingus last week brought an urgent application over the Irish Aviation Authority’s (IAA’s) decision to limit passenger numbers to 25.2 million for the period. Most of the other big players on the exchange AIB, Kingspan, Kerry and Glanbia ended the session in the red as investors awaited bigger news later in the week. Permanent TSB and hotel group Dalata were among the few shares to advance. European stocks retreated on Monday as caution over the imminent US presidential election weighed on the regional benchmark, though losses were kept in check by buoyant banking and energy shares. M&A speculation, especially in the luxury goods sector, sparked some sizable moves. EssilorLuxottica popped higher on renewed chatter that Meta Platforms is weighing a stake in the eyewear manufacturer. Elsewhere, Schneider Electric shares slipped after the French electric equipment maker named Olivier Blum as chief executive officer, just days after the group was among companies fined by French antitrust regulators over a price-fixing pact. European equities have drifted lower over the past month or so as investors brace for multiple risk events, including this week’s US presidential election, as well as interest rate decisions from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The UK’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose marginally on Monday, helped by energy shares, while cautious investors braced for the U.S. presidential election and a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) later this week. The blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.1 per cent at 8,184.24 points, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 dipped 0.1 per cent. The heavyweight oil and gas sector rose 0.7 per cent as oil prices jumped more than 2 per cent after a decision by OPEC+ to delay increasing output by a month. The personal goods sector, however, led sectoral gains, driven by an 4.8 per cent jump in Burberry after a report that Italy’s Moncler was considering a bid for the luxury retailer. The banking sector rose 1.1 per cent, supported by Natwest Group that advanced 2.6 per cent to a 13-year high. US stock indexes slipped in choppy trading on Monday, as investors braced for a pivotal week for global markets in which Americans will elect a new president and the Federal Reserve is likely to cut its benchmark policy rate. Some of the so-called “Trump trades” lost ground after a recent poll showed Ms Harris leading in Iowa, triggering a retreat in dollar, bond yields and bitcoin. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 397.83 points, or 0.95 per cent, to 41,654.14,and the S&P 500 lost 27.52 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 5,701.28. Most megacap stocks lost ground, with Tesla dropping 1.8 per cent as the EV maker’s China-made vehicle sales fell in October. However, chip heavyweight Nvidia rose 1.6 per cent, after S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday the company would replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Intel’s 4.3 per cent slide weighed on the Dow. - Additional reporting by Bloomberg and Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) Faces Struggles Amid Semiconductor Short Positions
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lam-research-corporation-lrcx-faces-175244308.html
Time Published: 2024-11-04T17:52:44Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jefferies’ Top Crowded Semiconductor Short Positions: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) stands against other Jefferies’ top crowded semiconductor short positions' stocks. With the third quarter earnings season with us, the semiconductor industry continues to be filled with surprises. 2023 and the better part of 2024 have seen investors remain bullish about chips due to the increased market size resulting from artificial intelligence. Yet–at the same time–the pipers of Wall Street have also been wary of over-investing in artificial intelligence and the state of the broader chip manufacturing industry apart from the fortunes of the AI industry. For the latter front, October has been quite eventful. It once again reminded us that even the firms closest to a monopoly these days aren’t immune from either macroeconomic headwinds or from worried investors. It saw the shares of the most important company in the semiconductor industry tank by a stunning 21.64% in just two days after a rather interesting set of events. This stock ranked 8th on our recent list of AI stocks that were trending in the news and this was unsurprising. It was due to report its earnings on October 16th, but the report ended up leaking a day earlier. Earnings leaks are a serious matter, and even more so for this firm since its business provides investors with early insight into the affairs of the semiconductor industry ahead of an earnings cycle for other firms. The leaked earnings saw the firm guide its 2025 net sales at a midpoint of €32.5 billion as it warned that the weakness in the semiconductor industry “is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness.” Since its machines are booked months in advance, the firm has a greater insight into its future cash flows than others, and investors were further spooked by its bookings. The bookings sat at €2.6 billion as of the third quarter, for a wide miss over midpoint analyst estimates of €5 billion. Consequently, investors weren’t impressed. The day that the earnings report leaked, the shares dropped by 16% for their biggest one-day drop in more than two decades. They continued their downward spiral the following day to close 6.42% lower and extend the two-day cumulative drop to 21.64%. While these drops might seem to be a bit too much since after all, you don’t see multi-decade records get broken every day, they stem from the uncertainty that investors have to contend with when analyzing complex industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry is divided into three tiers. Starting from the top, firms like GPU and CPU designers are responsible for selling products to consumers and businesses. The second tier is made of manufacturers which produce the chips and the third is made of firms that provide the manufacturing equipment. Consequently, the fact that the chip manufacturing equipment provider’s downbeat revenue guidance wiped off billions of dollars of capital from the semiconductor industry was unsurprising. As per Bloomberg, following the bookings miss and lower guidance, US-listed chip stocks, and Asian stocks bled a collective $420 billion in value. Michael Roeg, an analyst at investment bank Petercam Degroof provided more color into the drop. After the release, he shared that sales trends at the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer “are a misleading indicator for the overall health of the semiconductor industry.” This is because the firm “has been spending rather low capex numbers so far this year, and they may do so again next year because their overall (plant) utilization is not as good as their sales numbers suggest.” Utilization refers to the percentage of time that expensive chip machines are running and producing chips and fabs prefer to have high rates since it decreases the time it takes for them to recuperate their investment. Low capital expenditure affects utilization since if utilization is low then chip manufacturers do not feel the need to spend heavily for new machines. In sum, these trends mean that semiconductor spending at the bottom tier of the industry remains muted unless demand picks up and utilization grows. Shifting gears, the top tier of the industry is divided into several categories. One category includes firms like Wall Street’s favorite AI stock, the GPU designer whose shares are up 198% year-to-date. Due to the market’s rush into AI, while investors have been kind to this firm, they have been far more prudent for others. One such firm is responsible for manufacturing silicon carbide chips that are used for power management by electric vehicles. Since the demand for EV vehicles has slowed, leading to the shares of Elon Musk’s car company losing 12.3% year to date, the shares of this firm haven’t done well either. They are down 18.3% year to date, and if you’re interested in knowing more about this stock, we’ve included it in today’s list. This overall bifurcation in the semiconductor industry hasn’t skipped the attention of institutional investors. According to Jefferies’ October Trading Positioning Survey, the percentage of investors overweight on semiconductor stocks was 42%, a strong 18-point drop over July’s figures. The funds that were underweight on these stocks grew by five points from July to sit at 16%, so let’s take a look at the stocks that they have shorted. To make our list of Jefferies’ top overcrowded semiconductor short positions, we ranked the top ten crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician operating an automated semiconductor processing machine with laser accuracy. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 84 Shares Short % Of Outstanding: 2.49% Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is one of the few companies in the world that makes and sells products that are used in several phases of semiconductor fabrication. These phases include etching, deposition, and managing intra-chip connecting circuits called interconnects. Its product portfolio also makes Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) a good example of a chip stock that is struggling these days even though AI optimism still persists on Wall Street. The shares are down 2.58% year to date due to multiple factors. Firstly, during its fiscal 2024, 42% of Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)’s revenue came from the memory industry. This industry has struggled in 2023 and has been on a slow recovery this year which hasn’t helped ignite investor consequences. Secondly, 42% of its revenue came from China, where not only have economic struggles hurt Lam Research Corporation’s (NASDAQ:LRCX) revenue but investors are also wary of future sanctions. Artisan Partners mentioned Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “The top contributors to performance for the quarter were Alphabet, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Elevance. Lam Research shares rose 10% during the quarter and are up 67% over the past year, primarily due to optimism around the pending investment cycle in semiconductor capital expenditures. Lam is one of the largest equipment manufacturers used to make semiconductor chips. This equipment, commonly referred to as WFE (wafer fabrication equipment), is expected to experience significant growth due to a combination of a cyclical rebound in memory chips and growing demand for new AI-related chips. Lam’s product portfolio is particularly well positioned to benefit from both trends and should grow even faster than the overall market. Its shares now trade at ~30X prior peak earnings, which suggests this dynamic is well understood by the market and is mostly priced in.” Overall, LRCX ranks 7th on our list of Jefferies’ top crowded semiconductor short positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of LRCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LRCX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

On the eve of Election Day, the Dow Jones slid 200 points as investors held back, anxiously awaiting the results. The subdued stock activity coincided with a rally in safe-haven U.S. Treasurys, indicating that some investors are shifting toward lower-risk assets in anticipation of potential market volatility. By afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dipped by 203 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed slight gains of 0.16% and 0.10%, respectively. The cautious trading reflects broader market sentiment, with investors balancing optimism against uncertainty ahead of the election outcome. Palantir Technologies (PLTR-1.30%) is set to release its earnings report after the closing bell. Known for its advanced AI tools used by military and intelligence agencies, Palantir has become a prominent player amid the tech world’s ongoing AI surge. Moreover, this Thursday, investors will closely monitor the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision, as well as the subsequent press conference featuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%) shares rose over 1% on Monday as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+3.85%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A-1.41%) has continued to sell off considerable stakes in several companies as it grows its cash pile to a record $325.2 billion. In the third quarter, Berkshire sold $36.1 billion of stock overall, including from major holdings Apple (AAPL+1.85%) and Bank of America (BAC-1.41%), the company disclosed in regulatory filings Saturday. Meanwhile, it purchased just $1.5 billion of stock in that same period. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article.

Title: Playing The U.S. Elections - Part 1: Stocks To Pick If You Favor Trump

BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA - OCTOBER 05: Elon Musk embraces Republican presidential nominee, former ... [+] President Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds on October 05, 2024 in Butler, Pennsylvania. This is the first time that Trump has returned to Butler since he was injured during an attempted assassination on July 13. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) The U.S. Presidential election is nearing its curtain call. And from the look of things, this is going to be yet another photo finish. If you think Trump's Make America Great Again campaign did enough to get him past the finishing line - and into the White House - for a second term, then here is a list of stocks that you could bet on to make the most of market movements in the near term. And, for the flip side, check out Harris Stocks: Promising Picks If Harris Wins. The stocks that we believe will benefit the most from Trump's return to office are: DJT is a no-brainer, since Trump is the majority shareholder in the company which operates the social media platform Truth Social. Admittedly, the stock has been extremely volatile over the last one year, with prices swinging between a low of $11.75 and a high of $79.38 over this period. While the stock has gained 75% so far this year, it fell more than 30% last week. The stock should see significant gains if Trump wins, but be prepared for more such wild swings till the result is locked in. Two more companies that are directly associated with Trump, and should see a big win with Trump. Rumble is an online video platform and cloud services business that hosts Truth Social, and Phunware is a mobile software company that provided campaign data and also built a reelection app for Trump in the past. While both stocks have been very volatile, like DJT, since the beginning of this year, trading activity in RUM has been more stable in the last six months - making it the better pick among the two. Elon Musk has been a vocal supporter of Trump, and the time (and money) invested by the billionaire inventor on the Trump campaign is expected to yield strong returns for his companies if Trump wins. We detailed the entwined fates of Trump and Tesla in Musk's Trump Card: Will Tesla Be Boosted Or Totaled? and Can Trump Take Tesla Stock To $0? There is no denying that TSLA stock stands to gain big from a Trump win - both near- as well as long-term. Besides the personal camaraderie between Trump and Musk, Trump's frequent calls for higher tariffs for Chinese imports (including Chinese-made EVs) should directly help Tesla sell more cars in the U.S. Stocks of the two largest oil service companies in the world have had a very forgettable year, with both of them losing 25% of their value so far. But that could change very quickly if Trump emerges victorious. Trump's support for oil and gas companies will reflect in favorable policies by his administration policies toward conventional energy companies which took a backseat to renewable energy companies under Biden's administration. Schlumberger and Halliburton stand out in particular among oil and gas companies because their stocks are less volatile in the near term than those of diversified energy companies such as Exxon Mobil or Chevron. And both SLB and HAL figure among the most undervalued Energy stocks in our analysis. Several of Trump's poll promises look better for U.S. businesses as a whole - particularly his talks about additional cuts to corporate taxes. The round of tax cuts he introduced in 2017 had a tangible impact on overall business sentiment and banks benefited in particular from the increased level of activity across industries. We expect a similar benefit for banks this time, too, if Trump returns, with the diversified banking giants gaining the most due to their strong presence in retail, private, commercial as well as corporate banking services. Both BAC and C are good picks in the event of a Trump win as we believe they are among the most undervalued Diversified Bank stocks All the stocks above are great near-term picks in the event Trump wins the U.S. elections. But that is not the only possible outcome of this election. And election-related trends will soon give way to long-term trends across industries. In the long run, the stocks you pick should add value to your portfolio without being too volatile. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the period 2021-2023. And as a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

BREAKING: The Fed cuts its key interest rate again Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time While the latest polls suggest that the presidential election may be a close one, some social media advertisements are painting a very different picture. In some ads for the online betting platform Polymarket, graphs illustrate former President Donald Trump’s lead as “up to 32% in the odds” over Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming the service is “the most accurate way to track the election.” What Polymarket isn’t always disclosing alongside the ads, though, is that the displayed percentages are actually odds tabulated based on bets placed with its service, not projections based on representative voter polling. Well over half of the ads don’t mention that the numbers are rooted in prediction-based markets. “The idea is if people disagree with the market price, they have the opportunity to capitalize by buying the side they think is priced too low,” Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan said in a social media post. Some ads for the platform read, “Don’t trust the polls — trust the markets.” The social media ads have flooded Facebook, Instagram, X and other platforms. On Meta alone, Polymarket has poured at least $50,000 into a campaign including 45 advertisements, which promote the odds, according to data available in Facebook’s ad library. One advertisement — viewed more than 900,000 times on Facebook and Instagram since Oct. 28 — depicts Trump winning in the Polymarket odds, according to the Meta Ad Library. Among the viewers, 20% are men ages 45 to 54 and 12% are women in the same age range. The advertisement was seen the most in California, New York and Texas, with 16%, 11%, and 10% of viewers in those regions, respectively. Several others include questions such as “Did serving fries help Trump’s chances?” or “Does Trump have all the aura?” Of the 45 Meta ads, many include solo images of Trump, some include side-by-side images of both candidates, and none include solo images of Harris. A separate sponsored campaign from the right-wing social media personality Shaneyy Richh included nine advertisements promoting Polymarket forecasts. “The full list of actual conservatives that get polled by political pollsters,” read one ad, which depicted a man squinting at a small piece of paper. “Tired of biased polls? Find out what’s really happening in the 2024 race,” the caption said. On X — owned by one of Trump’s biggest supporters, Elon Musk — advertisements also promoted the predictions on its search page. Polymarket, which offers bets in sports, business, science, politics and more, reports that users have spent more than $2.7 billion placing bets on the next president. According to an X post, one user bet $2.2 million on a Harris win. Based on user bets, Polymarket says Trump’s odds of winning are roughly 65.5% and Harris’ are 34.5% as of Oct. 31. “Odds on Polymarket are derived from the market price of a contract that pays $1 if an event occurs and expires worthless if it doesn’t,” a Polymarket blog post reads. “For example, someone paying 60 cents for a Trump ‘yes’ contract, implies a 60% chance that he wins.” Not all are quick to place bets or even trust Polymarket’s system. “Trump and right-wing influencers are pushing these Polymarket odds as a poll,” Claudio Vallejo, an online creator, said via a TikTok video. “They’re using these odds as proof or evidence that Trump is peaking at the right moment and is so popular that there’s no way he can lose in November. ... They’re laying the groundwork for ‘too big to rig.’” A company spokesperson referred to a “misunderstanding” of the company, explaining the stats are not opinion polls but odds calculated by shares traded on Polymarket. The odds aren’t meant to reflect public opinion; they reflect bettors’ level of confidence in either a Trump win or a Harris win. “A big point of confusion is that both vote share and odds are expressed as a percent, but do not mean the same thing,” Polymarket wrote on its Substack page. Coplan recently took to X to defend the platform as “non-partisan,” calling it a “reality check” meant to “harness the power of free markets to demystify the real world events that matter most to you.” “Polymarket is not about politics,” he wrote in a statement on X on Oct. 25. “This US election cycle, we’ve been pulled onto center stage, as people are fed up with having to make sense of ‘For You’ feeds, pundits, and incongruent polls — we take that responsibility seriously. ... Hopefully politics is the first step to get the masses to realize the value of market-based forecasts.” Though the ads are trending in the U.S., it is prohibited for “U.S. persons,” any citizen or even any temporary resident to take part in the betting, according to Polymarket’s terms. Currently, Polymarket requires bettors to accept terms and conditions confirming they are “not a resident, national, or agent of the United States” or several other countries where the platform is regulated against. In 2022, Polymarket was fined $1.4 million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which said that it was illegally running events betting in the U.S. A federal appeals court recently overturned the CFTC’s decision to prohibit election betting company Kalshi from limiting “U.S. persons” from placing bets on their markets — but Polymarket wasn’t part of that suit, and the law that prohibits betting on Polymarket is still in place. Kalshi’s stats show a 59% and 41% division between Trump and Harris, respectively. The company has also used social media to promote election betting, spending over $140,000 on Meta ads, according to the company's ad library. While people in the U.S. aren’t supposed to place their own bets, a Polymarket spokesperson said the platform could be useful for Americans because it acts as a live information source similar to the stock market. The social media advertisements don’t explicitly encourage people in the U.S. to bet, but they also don’t include a disclaimer about the regulation. Nevertheless, the site is gaining attention from many right-wing officials and celebrities, including Trump himself. “We’re up in the polls pretty substantially. They have a new phenomenon, and that’s a gambling poll. They call it the poly poll or something I’ve never heard of,” Trump said at a rally in Michigan on Oct. 18, with a crowd member shouting out “Polymarket” to correct him. “Polymarket, and I guess it’s 64 to 38, 36, something like that. So that’s not bad. I don’t know what the hell it means, but it means that we’re doing pretty well,” he added. Though Polymarket called Trump’s reference to the company a “common error” of “confusing Polymarket odds with polls,” a paid advertisement shares the rally clip with the caption: “they call it the pollypoll or something.” The Instagram reel doesn’t include contain any similar clarification as the one on the blog post. Musk also took to X to share the predictions — then 67% and 33.1% for Trump and Harris, respectively. In another post, Musk said Polymarket odds were “more accurate than polls.” A Nov. 3 NBC News poll found Harris and Trump were deadlocked among respondents, each with 49% support from registered voters. Every major poll from the last week shows a split between the candidates from 0 to 3 percentage points, with most differences falling within the margins of error. Some experts warn people to use caution when they analyze both the polls and the markets. “When people look at polls, one is just expecting real precision at a specific moment,” John Fortier, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on topics such as election demographics and voting, told NBC News last week. “It’s not that we can’t get good information ... but if you’re really expecting polling to tell you ... what’s going to happen next Tuesday absolutely, obviously there’s just built-in margin of error.” Though Fortier said the financial risk associated with markets can be seen as a “more serious” gesture than answers on a poll, he emphasized “real doubts” and warned that “the details matter.” “I just see the possibilities for more market distortion,” he said. “I’m generally skeptical, and then I’m even more skeptical of a market that is narrower but also excludes American citizens.” Sophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Crypto Voters In 2024 And Beyond: Shaping Policy And Political Power

PARIS, FRANCE - JANUARY 11: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of the digital ... [+] cryptocurrency Bitcoin is displayed in front of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) logo on January 11, 2024 in Paris, France. The first American Bitcoin ETF was authorized by the SEC (Commissioner of the American Stock Exchange) on Wednesday January 10, 2024. Around ten of the world's largest financial asset managers have filed an application with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin. ETFs. After blocking bitcoin from entering Wall Street for more than 10 years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) invested in bitcoin. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) The 2024 election cycle has brought an unexpected issue to the forefront of U.S. politics: cryptocurrency. Both major political parties are addressing digital assets, blockchain technology, and regulatory frameworks, as crypto has grown from a niche investment to a mainstream topic. Candidates are now actively courting the "crypto voter," recognizing the widespread appeal and economic potential of the digital asset economy. Crypto’s newfound prominence is fueled by recent moves from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, which have entered the Bitcoin ETF market, lending further legitimacy to crypto assets. Political action committees like the Stand With Crypto Alliance and Fairshake Super PAC are also pouring resources into pro-crypto candidates, positioning cryptocurrency as a policy issue that cuts across party lines. As political candidates and parties look to gain traction with voters, crypto has proven to be a compelling, if divisive, topic that speaks to younger, tech-savvy demographics and finance industry titans alike. In this election, crypto’s appeal in key swing states could impact close races as candidates respond to a unique confluence of voter interest and economic opportunity. Polling data from industry leaders such as Digital Currency Group (DCG), Paradigm, and Stand With Crypto highlights a distinct “crypto voter” demographic. This emerging constituency is becoming a powerful influence in electoral decisions. According to a ConsenSys/HarrisX survey, 92% of crypto owners are committed to voting in 2024, which underscores the political mobilization within this group​. Stand With Crypto reports that 71% of self-identified crypto voters across political parties prefer candidates who support transparent and fair crypto regulations. This figure underscores mounting frustration over vague and restrictive U.S. crypto policies. Additionally, a DCG survey shows that 62% of young voters (ages 18–34) are “more likely” to support a candidate who advocates for crypto-friendly policies, as this demographic views digital assets as essential for financial inclusion, offering an alternative to traditional financial systems. The HarrisX survey also notes that crypto owners skew younger, male, urban, and are more racially diverse than the average voter base, with 33% of surveyed crypto voters identifying as non-white​. Crypto is also gaining traction in swing states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona, where Paradigm polling found that 28% of likely voters consider a candidate’s stance on crypto important. Stand With Crypto’s data further highlights crypto’s relevance for minority voters in swing states; for instance, 23% of Black and Latino voters rate pro-crypto policies as a top priority, emphasizing the potential for digital assets to broaden access to financial services in underserved communities. Polling reveals that distrust in traditional financial institutions is a significant factor for crypto interest among voters. DCG reports that 58% of respondents cited distrust of banks and financial institutions as a primary reason for exploring digital assets, pointing to a broader trend of viewing decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain as viable alternatives to traditional banking systems. Interest in crypto spans the political spectrum, with 43% of Republicans and 39% of Democrats favoring “sensible regulation” to promote innovation without stifling growth. Despite bipartisan appeal, support for crypto-friendly candidates leans slightly Democratic, with 54% favoring candidates like Vice President Harris, who emphasizes crypto’s potential to promote economic advancement for the middle class. For many crypto voters, financial inclusion remains central; nearly 75% view digital assets as a means to create economic opportunity, particularly for communities historically marginalized by traditional finance. Among Democratic voters, crypto is particularly popular among non-white demographics, with 22% of Black Democrats and 25% of Hispanic Democrats owning crypto​. For Republicans, 41% of non-white Republicans own or have bought crypto​. Crypto ownership is highest among Republicans under 40, with 45% of this group involved in crypto, emphasizing youth-driven interest​. These findings illustrate how crypto’s role in the 2024 election is nuanced, resonating particularly with younger and minority voters. Candidates paying attention to these trends are likely to adopt more balanced and informed regulatory approaches. Money has long been a double-edged sword in American politics. Financial contributions help amplify candidates’ platforms but can also create imbalances. Financial backing enables candidates to reach more voters and cover costs for travel, events, and advertisements. However, donations from wealthier interests can tilt the playing field, creating the perception that policies favor the elite over the public. Crypto PACs have infused $119 million into the 2024 election cycle, accounting for nearly half of corporate donations, with Fairshake PAC alone raising over $200 million to back pro-crypto candidates, second only to a major pro-Trump super PAC​. Coinbase, a major player, has directed $50 million to Fairshake PAC, positioning it as a major influencer in various congressional races, including both Republican and Democratic candidates who support pro-crypto legislation​. This influx of crypto money, particularly from PACs and industry-focused initiatives, adds another layer of complexity, as blockchain-based prediction markets like Polymarket allow users to gauge public sentiment on political outcomes. While these decentralized markets offer real-time data, they also pose regulatory challenges and concerns over transparency. Blockchain-based prediction markets such as Polymarket provide a unique view of public sentiment on political outcomes by allowing users to wager on election results. Although these platforms offer valuable insights, they also highlight the need for new regulatory frameworks to manage potential manipulation risks. Polymarket’s emergence reflects the broader impact of blockchain technology in politics, where its applications extend beyond financial innovation into political influence. The trajectory of cryptocurrency in U.S. policy will largely depend on the new administration’s approach to balancing innovation with consumer protection. Institutional interest in digital assets, as seen in the rise of Bitcoin ETFs and DeFi platforms, suggests that crypto is here to stay. However, to responsibly harness this potential, the U.S. must adopt forward-thinking policies that encourage innovation while managing risks. To address the critical needs of the digital economy, the next administration must consider the following: The 2024 election has solidified cryptocurrency’s role as a transformative force in politics. Its ability to bridge divides and appeal to diverse constituencies positions digital assets as an influential issue for American voters. As the next administration shapes its crypto policies, its approach to regulation, financial inclusion, and international cooperation will determine the U.S.’s standing in the global digital economy. By embracing sound policies, the U.S. has the opportunity to lead the way, fostering a prosperous future for early adopters and cautious newcomers alike. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: A new weight loss pill outperformed Novo Nordisk's version

Time Published: 2024-11-04T15:39:55Z

Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+1.82%) released new clinical trial data on Sunday for its experimental weight-loss drugs, which include a highly anticipated oral pill. The San Diego-based company’s stock surged over 6% during pre-market trading on Monday. It has since fallen about 5% from its closing price on Friday. This marks the latest development in the competitive race among pharmaceutical companies to introduce new weight-loss drug alternatives to current market leaders like Wegovy, Zepbound, and Ozempic. Viking Therapeutics shared on Sunday the latest data of its two clinical trials testing an injection and pill versions of its experimental weight-loss treatment VK2735 at the industry conference Obesity Week in San Antonio, Texas. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know The company reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking’s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh noted on Monday that Viking’s results surpassed Wall Street expectations and outperformed those of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.05%) experimental weight-loss pill, amycretin. “Notably, the 100 mg dose appears to be outpacing the 100 mg dose of amycretin, which achieved about a 5% placebo-adjusted weight loss in four weeks,” Hsieh wrote. Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 2% on Monday morning. In a phase 2 trial of the same drug administered as a weekly injection, patients experienced an average weight loss of 14.7% over 13 weeks. For comparison, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+2.10%) Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks during a clinical trial. U.K.-based pharma giant AstraZeneca (AZN+0.45%) also shared new details about its weight-loss drug pipeline at the conference on Monday. In an early-stage clinical trial, patients taking the company’s pill lost an average of 5.8% of their body weight over four weeks. The pill, which it licensed last year from the Chinese biotech Eccogene, was deemed safe and tolerable and will advance to phase 2 clinical trials. AstraZeneca is also developing two additional obesity drugs: one targeting the hormone amylin and a GLP-1 injectable. After the launch of the diabetes medication Ozempic in 2017, the demand for weight-loss drugs has skyrocketed in recent years. Fervent demand for Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic over the last year had the company racing to keep up with supply. The Denmark-based company’s revenue even buoyed the nation’s GDP in 2023. Several pharmaceutical companies are now chasing the hype, working to introduce new drugs to get in on the demand. In addition to Viking Therapeutics, Regeneron, Amgen, Pfizer, and Zealand Pharma are all developing weight-loss drugs. Unsatisfied with their own success, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also developing even more powerful weight-loss drugs. The majority of these companies are also working to introduce weight-loss pills. Weight-loss drugs that already on the market are administered as once-weekly injections. But a pill could help with current supply constraints and open the market to patients hesitant to taking injections.

Title: A Nvidia partner's stock surged because Nvidia wants chips faster

An Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%) partner in South Korea saw its shares surge Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker wants chips faster. SK Hynix’s South Korea–listed shares closed up almost 6.5% after SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won told reporters that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked the company to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. Chey, speaking at the SK AI Summit in Seoul, added that Nvidia is still struggling to fulfill chip demand but that the two are working together on the shortage, Bloomberg reported. Huang requested that SK Hynix provide samples of its HBM4 chips earlier than expected, Chey said. In October, SK Hynix said it expected to supply customers with the new HBM chip, which Nvidia needs for its artificial intelligence chips, by the second half of 2025. Chey said both Nvidia and SK Hynix “are on the same page” about HBM4’s schedule, according to Bloomberg. The South Korea-based chipmaker’s shares are up 37.1% so far this year. The company also unveiled a 16-layer HBM3E at the summit that it said will be with customers early next year. SK Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said the company will release the next-generation HBM5 and HBM5E sometime between 2028 and 2030. In October, SK Hynix reported record revenue, operating profit, and net profit, “achieving best-ever quarterly performance” in the third quarter on demand for its memory chips for AI technology. “SK Hynix has solidified its position as the world’s No.1 AI memory company by achieving the highest business performance ever in the third quarter of this year,” Kim Woohyun, chief financial officer at SK Hynix, said in a statement. “We will continue to maximize profitability while securing stable revenues by taking flexible product and supply strategies in line with market demand.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Chip fever has created an $11 billion debt market backed by Nvidia's AI-enabling GPUs

Top Wall Street firms have loaned billions to a handful of tech companies that have used Nvidia's artificial intelligence-enabling GPUs as collateral, The Finanacial Times reported. According to the FT, big financial institutions including BlackRock, Blackstone, Pimco, and Carlyle, have made over $11 billion in loans to "neocloud" companies, tech companies that provide cloud services to other tech firms building AI products. These firms are among some of Nvidia's largest customers and include names like CoreWeave, Crusoe, and Lambda Labs. Collectively, they have purchased tens of thousands of Nvidia's highly sought-after chips and have offered them as collateral for loans that they use to buy even more GPUs, the report said. There are concerns, though, over the value of Nvidia's GPUs, with the price of existing AI chips potentially coming down as more advanced models are released and as companies potentially dial back AI spending. Having access to GPUs is no longer like having a "golden ticket to Willy Wonka's factory," as it was considered to be a year ago, a senior executive at one of CoreWeave's lenders told the FT. Leasing contracts between neocloud firms and tech groups, meanwhile, are poised to expire in the coming years. That could result in a huge supply of chips making their way back to the market, the report added. CoreWeave, Crusoe, and Lambda Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Nvidia declined to comment. Elsewhere on Wall Street, there are concerns that Nvidia's huge pace of growth cannot be sustained, with doubts rising about returns on AI investment by corporations and the threat of competition from other chip makers muscling into the AI space.

Title: Nvidia is about to replace Intel in the Dow

Nvidia (NVDA+1.56%) shares rose 1% in Monday morning trading as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors. To make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC+3.85%) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week. Nvidia, often hailed as an “AI darling,” has seen substantial gains throughout the year, driven by its advancements in AI chip technology. The company’s growth trajectory is expected to continue in the coming year, bolstered by expanding interest and investment in artificial intelligence — a field where Nvidia remains a clear leader. Nvidia’s in-demand Hopper chips, which power some of the world’s most advanced generative AI models, have propelled the company to record-high quarterly results and a $3 trillion valuation. The chipmaker’s next-generation Blackwell AI chip platform was launched in March and has seen a large surge in demand. The stock split Nvidia announced earlier this year also boosted popularity and growth. The company’s share price has surged by 173% so far this year — and by 193% in the past year. In the past five years, the stock has seen an astronomical 2,498% rise. In contrast, Intel has lagged in the AI boom and missed key opportunities. For example, Intel decided to pass on investing in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, which has since revolutionized AI applications and reached a valuation of around $80 billion. Intel’s stock has suffered, dropping over 53% this year alone, highlighting the challenges the company faces as it tries to catch up with more agile competitors such as Nvidia.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell about 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped slightly. A so-far solid earnings season and interest rate-cut optimism are giving the market reasons to be cheerful ahead of Tuesday's election, a big risk event for markets.

Also looming large is the Fed's two-day policy meeting, kicking off a day later than usual on Wednesday in light of the election. Wall Street is convinced that Chair Jerome Powell will usher in a 0.25% rate cut on Thursday, despite signs of stubborn inflation and muddied job market signals.

US stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for this week's US elections and a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the AI chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also rose on Monday amid rising oil prices. Investors are focused on this Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential elections, followed by a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policy makers will announce a rate cut of 25 basis points following the meeting. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report shows that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+ announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia and other countries said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the AI chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also rose on Monday amid rising oil prices. Investors are focused on this Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential elections, followed by a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policy makers will announce a rate cut of 25 basis points following the meeting. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report shows that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+ announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries along with Russia and other countries said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

Title: NVIDIA Starts Diverting Orders Away From Super Micro Computer (SMCI) As A Potential Delisting And DOJ Investigation Loom Large

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a retailer of high-performance servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, is NVIDIA's third-largest customer. Additionally, in what is a testament to the heretofore symbiotic relationship between these two entities, SMCI's biggest client is NVIDIA, and its second-biggest client is an entity that is backed by NVIDIA. Now, however, it appears that NVIDIA has had enough of Super Micro Computer's near-constant headaches, and is deliberately trying to create some much-needed distance. *NVIDIA HAS BEGUN REDIRECTING ORDERS FROM SUPER MICRO COMPUTER TO OTHER SUPPLIERS IN ORDER TO PREVENT SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS $NVDA $SMCI $DELL $HPE — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) November 4, 2024 To wit, Digi Times is reporting today that NVIDIA has begun redirecting its orders that were originally placed with Super Micro Computer to other suppliers. This development comes as SMCI is now contending with allegations of financial malfeasance, a preliminary DOJ investigation, the exodus of its second auditor in around 18 months, and an imminent de-listing from the Nasdaq exchange. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Super Micro Computer's travails began in August when Hindenburg Research detailed instances of alleged accounting fraud and corporate governance malfeasance in a detailed report. SMCI then delayed the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on the 30th of June, presumably in a bid to undertake an internal review. Do note that under the prevailing statutory requirements, SMCI's annual report had to be filed by the 30th of August. Meanwhile, the DOJ has also reportedly launched an investigation into the affairs at Super Micro Computer, with a particular focus on the alleged accounting violations. As per Hindenburg Research's anecdotes, Super Micro Computer engaged in distribution channel stuffing by pushing products to distributors based on artificially inflated demand forecasts, undertook partial shipments to meet specific sales targets and inflated its total shipment count in the process, re-hired top executives responsible for "widespread accounting violations" that had resulted in a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC, and paid nearly a billion dollars over the past three years to non-arm's-length suppliers such as Ablecom and Compuware. Finally, do note that the Nasdaq exchange recently warned Super Micro Computer of a potential de-listing action should it fail to file the requisite annual report by the 16th of November. That punitive action could come as soon as the 20th of November. Meanwhile, as we noted in a dedicated post earlier today, Super Micro Computer has negotiated major changes to its loan agreement with Cathay Bank, with the firm now required to furnish audited financial statements by the 31st of December as opposed to the earlier covenant, which posited the 28th of October as the deadline for furnishing these financial documents.

Title: DTC is dead. Long live DTC.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. As a channel, it remains key to growth for many retailers. But the era of the DTC brand as we know it is over. In 2019, DTC brands Casper, Away and Glossier were touting $1 billion-plus valuations, all of them reaching that threshold within five years of being founded. They were riding high on cheap capital, a strong economy and the hype the direct-to-consumer model had generated. The next couple of years would see Casper go public, alongside retail darling Warby Parker and sustainable footwear brand Allbirds. At the same time, all three trumpeted big plans for brick-and-mortar footprints and category expansion, and touted the strength of the DTC model. It seemed DTC brands could do no wrong. Then, things changed. Casper was sold to private equity just two years after it went public, Allbirds announced store closures and a shift to a “more profitable” distributor model globally, and Outdoor Voices abruptly shuttered its fleet of stores before being snapped up by the same firm that owns Draper James. “Everyone believed the mantra should be DTC or die because they wanted to eliminate the middle person and make more money,” Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, said. “What they finally realized was: No one eliminates the middle person, they simply become the middle person, and that brings its own set of costs. So for a period of time, people became so obsessed with where they sell rather than what they sell that they lost track of who they were.” Precipitous sales declines at former disruptors, including those buoyed by the pandemic like Peloton, became somewhat of a norm. The bike company and its peers also grew steadily more interested in other sales channels, including Amazon and more traditional wholesale partners. The more established brands that had jumped on board the DTC bandwagon when it was chugging along also began pulling back, recognizing some of the same challenges, and the allure of purely DTC brands faded. “If Allbirds had remained on its strong growth trajectory, if Peloton had maintained the growth tear it was on, the models probably wouldn't have pivoted that much. But they did change — and both companies fell into difficulties,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said, noting those challenges pushed both brands to expand their sales channels. “Now that genie has been let out of the bottle, it's not going to be put back in.” Even brands like Lululemon, which sells mostly DTC, have wholesale accounts, Saunders noted. “The term DTC is still used as a shorthand. I'm just not quite sure it's all that relevant now,” he said. Asked if we’ll still be talking about DTC brands in five years, Siegel put it more bluntly. “In a derogatory, backwards-looking fashion? Sure.” As the direct-to-consumer model matured, a slew of factors that helped DTC brands flourish began waning. The general retail market slowed, customer acquisition costs on social media surged, venture funds dried up, the cost to fulfill online orders grew and brands started hitting their own growth ceilings. “There's a lot of things that moved and shifted in a relatively short period of time that meant that DTC went from being almost the darling or the hero of retail, to being a channel that had a lot of challenges and problems,” Saunders said. “And had a lot to prove that it wasn't necessarily, in some cases, proving.” The model itself was flawed from the start, according to Siegel, whose firm has done multiple reports on the impact selling direct-to-consumer has on key metrics like gross margin. Critically, Siegel found that brands pivoting to direct did not see a relative increase in revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating profit or operating margin. “It just didn't happen. Back then, obviously, that was controversial — and it triggered a lot of fights,” Siegel said. “But now people are looking at the results and they're acknowledging wholesale, when done right, is truly a powerful thing.” “There was so much money sloshing around, it was very difficult to do badly.” Neil Saunders Managing Director at GlobalData Some up-and-coming brands, including Vuori, may have dodged some of the growing pains in the sector by embracing wholesale from the start. Founder Joe Kudla has said before that the company saw a place for key wholesale partners from the beginning of its business and touted those relationships as part of the reason it was able to achieve profitability. “The partners we selected at the start in the U.S., and those we work with today globally, are very intentionally picked, and our distribution is deliberately limited to only the best accounts,” Andy Lawrence, vice president of international at Vuori, said via email. “While I wouldn’t say wholesale insulates any brand from all DTC challenges, at Vuori, it does add a critical component to our success. Wholesale, if done correctly, allows brands like us to connect authentically with the local customer.” Still, for a time many DTC brands simply didn’t invest in wholesale as a channel because selling directly to consumers was working. And investors were enthusiastic about funding DTC brands, profitability challenges or not, because capital was cheap and consumers had disposable income to spend on new brands and discretionary products. “There was so much money sloshing around, it was very difficult to do badly,” Saunders said. But in a more discriminating market, the value proposition of some of retail’s startups became far more important — and was often found wanting. Expensive exercise bikes and fancy sheets are harder to sell in a more risk-averse economy. “It's very important not to confuse problems with DTC — which, there are problems — with problems with the brand,” Saunders added. “Allbirds primarily has a brand problem. It doesn't really have a distribution problem, as such. So Allbirds could push itself into more stores, do more things — it's still not going to resolve the issues of the company because the problem is with the product and the position and the brand, it isn’t with the distribution method.” As startups and traditional brands alike recognize the limits of DTC, many are embracing a more measured model that values both DTC and wholesale. The sensibility of that approach has been touted frequently over the past few years as brands have moved away from strictly digital approaches, with one report earlier this year saying wholesale is still the most profitable investment channel for brands. "People chase simplicity when it seems to be intuitive." Simeon Siegel Managing Director at BMO Capital Markets Matt Katz, a managing partner at SSA & Company, describes what’s happening now as a “reset” driven by overinvestment in DTC and underinvestment in stores. The importance of stores and wholesale is now sending investments back in the other direction, and retailers are unlikely to lean back into DTC as hard as they did — that is, unless investors start funding it again. “Silly as it sounds, people chase simplicity when it seems to be intuitive. This is not the first time, and it certainly will not be the last time, that everyone chased a buzzword,” Siegel said. “When companies don't need to be profitable, profit and loss statements are not scrutinized. When companies don't need to be profitable, expenses are not scrutinized. That makes it much easier to chase a hope and a belief versus being held accountable for the actual results.” The swing to DTC — and the correction since then — has taught both brands and wholesalers some important lessons. Take Nike, for example. The rise of DTC brands spurred a huge investment from the sportswear giant in its own digital capabilities and stores, and at the same time caused Nike to cut ties with a slew of wholesale partners it deemed less important to its overall strategy. First, that led to exceptional growth. Then came a retraction, as Nike determined it had taken things too far and, in fact, did need those wholesale partners after all. Throw in layoffs, a cost-savings plan, a lawsuit surrounding the success of the DTC strategy and an abrupt CEO swap and you have a pretty good summary of the fallout to date. “DTC serves a lot of Nike customers, but it doesn't serve all of Nike's customers. A lot of product discovery, a lot of buying of Nike products is done by people who might go into a department store, especially some of the older age cohorts,” Saunders said. “These people are not going to go online directly to Nike. They want to buy it through the channels that they shop in. And if Nike disappears or pulls back from some of these channels, they lose the sales — it's as simple as that. And they underestimated that. They were almost a little bit arrogant as to the power of the Nike brand.” And make no mistake, Nike is a powerful brand. A $50 billion-a-year brand. “Consumers have taken over the leverage point and they are buying on availability and price and experience.” Matt Katz Managing Partner at SSA & Company But as Nike was learning its lessons, both good and bad, about DTC, its wholesale partners were also learning theirs. Foot Locker, one of the retailers Nike spurned and is now again seeking closer ties with, has unveiled its own turnaround actions to lure brands to its shelves, including revamping two-thirds of its Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker stores over the next few years. Macy’s, too, which received similar treatment from Nike, has been undergoing store refreshes at its go-forward locations as it looks to keep customers and brand partners coming back. “I think that the wholesale side really had to pull its socks up as well,” Saunders said, noting that retailers like Macy’s and Foot Locker have realized they are “serving two masters” now. “‘One of our masters is the consumer, but the other master is the brands. Because the brands don't have to be in our store necessarily and what we've got to prove to them is that we're a worthwhile partner.’” Indeed, while the pendulum has swung back toward wholesale, some brands are still moving away from certain retailers and could continue to do so if their partners don’t serve them well. Levi’s in its Q3 earnings report touted that its wholesale business now makes up less than 20% of its revenue, down from 30% in 2015. Analysts at the time pointed to Levi’s sales and profit growth as a sign that its DTC strategy is working, at least for now. “I think we've moved from retailers having the advantage. The retail-brand wholesale relationship used to be heavy, heavy retail. That was your point of distribution and the retailer chose which brands were most important, right?” Katz said. He noted that the balance shifted when brands developed their own access to customers through DTC. Now, Katz says, the consumer is in charge. “Consumers have taken over the leverage point and they are buying on availability and price and experience.” That means brands need to focus on being wherever the customer wants to buy, which might sometimes be wholesale and might sometimes be DTC and might sometimes be Amazon. "It became a battle of players within the ecosystem — who could edge out their collaborator." Simeon Siegel Managing Director at BMO Capital Markets During the height of DTC mania, companies like Nike and Adidas became very focused on what percentage of their revenue was DTC versus wholesale. Nike had a goal of upping DTC from 40% of its revenue to 60% by 2025, while Adidas aimed to reach a 50% DTC split by the same time period. Even with wholesale coming back in vogue, there is no universal answer for what that split should be, according to Siegel, and brands should be adjusting those percentages based on their individual needs. Having a strong DTC business also doesn’t have to come at the expense of wholesale. For Vuori, having wholesale partners has helped it gain brand awareness in new markets like the U.K. and Japan. “From that initial interaction, we then begin to see these newcomers start to interact and shop with us via our DTC channels too,” Lawrence said. “The omnichannel approach, including wholesale, is our best answer for how to expand in a profitable, brand accretive way.” DTC and wholesale have different strengths, according to Siegel, with DTC theoretically offering first-party data, higher margins, greater control over the brand and greater connection to consumers, while wholesale ideally gives brands a partner with experience distributing products economically and efficiently. “It became a battle,” Siegel said of how brands began approaching DTC and wholesale a few years ago. “It became a battle of players within the ecosystem — who could edge out their collaborator, as opposed to a holistic partnership where all sides could win.” A case could be made that the battle is largely over now, with hybrid models being embraced across the industry and wholesale-brand relationships becoming more collaborative. But what does all this mean for future brands? While most analysts agree that a hybrid model is the future, they also tend to agree that DTC will continue to be important for retail’s newest entrants. The channel is easy to set up and has lower initial costs, which makes it ideal for upstarts, but as the era of DTC brands fades, retail could also see more brands launching with partnerships already in place. When Vanessa Hudgens relaunched her beauty brand Know Beauty, for example, she did so with Amazon. And beauty brand Pretty Smart entered the market through an exclusive deal with Walmart as well as its own website, even working with the mass merchant to develop its product line prior to launch. “I think you'll see some of these brands may launch with very small strategic partnerships that give them their presence,” Katz said. “And if you can prove that the brand has staying power and pull, then you'll see continued investments in flagship real estate models.” That could range from pop-ups to permanent stores or limited geographic partnerships with retailers, Katz said, but regardless, there is likely to be a greater emphasis on how quickly a brand can grow its points of distribution. Some up-and-coming brands already offer prime examples of this: Actor Millie Bobby Brown launched her fashion brand at Nordstrom within months of its debut online. While they took slightly longer to branch out, intimates brands Skims and Savage X Fenty have both also pursued wholesale relationships, including internationally, in addition to their DTC channels. Pursuing wholesale partnerships isn’t without its challenges, though, particularly for young brands. “The problem with wholesale is you will go into a company and you will say to that company, ‘Look, I want you to stock our product’ and the first thing they will say is, ‘Our shelves are full,’” Saunders said. “So it's very difficult to break through. And then when you do break through, for a younger company, there are a lot of issues that you have to resolve. You have massive working capital requirements because if you're a brand-new brand and you're trying to get into a Walmart — even if Walmart agrees to take you into a fraction of the stores that they have — guess what? Your volume is terrific and most companies don't have the manufacturing capacity.” The model of the future may look a lot more like that of running brands Hoka and On, which have both surged in popularity recently and have benefited from strong DTC sales and also a healthy presence in wholesale. “You will get businesses that start off in both ways, but I think what is fortunate is … we've moved on from simply condemning a channel,” Siegel said. “There's no such thing as a bad channel. There are bad partnerships and there's bad execution.” Another challenge for new brands, according to Saunders, is the simple fact that “there’s a lot of stuff out there” already. Any startups in retail now have to make it through a noisy landscape and offer a valuable enough proposition to gain shopper interest. Identifying as a “DTC brand” just doesn’t much matter anymore. “We went through an era where companies identified themselves, and were known by others, by the outside world, based on where they sell, not what they sell. That's silly, right?” Siegel said. “Are you an apparel retailer? Are you a mattress retailer? Are you a connected fitness bike brand? Or are you a channel? … The idea of where you sell should always be a very important part of your business decision making. But it should not be who you are. You should not aspire to be a DTC brand. You should aspire to sell something special and figure out how to reach your consumer in the most economic, healthy, brand-appropriate way. I think, fortunately, we've moved a lot closer to that.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts CEO Tony Spring surprised the industry with a new tranche of 150 department store closures, 50 of which are shuttering in 2024.

The Fed cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points in September, indicating a turning point in its management of the U.S. economy and in its outlook for inflation. In late-September reports, strategists at JPMorgan and Fitch Ratings had predicted two additional interest rate trims by the end of 2024 and expect such reductions to continue into 2025. The CME Group's FedWatch tool puts the probability of a 25 basis point cut at this week's November meeting at 98%. The current probability of the benchmark rate being taken down by another 25 basis points at the December meeting is 78%. But some CEOs appear skeptical. Speaking last week at Saudi Arabia's showcase economic conference, the Future Investment Initiative, they see more inflation on the horizon for the U.S., as the nation's economic activity and both presidential candidates' policies involve developments that will potentially be inflationary and stimulatory — such as public spending, the onshoring of manufacturing and tariffs. A group of CEOs speaking at an FII panel moderated by CNBC's Sara Eisen — which included Wall Street hegemons such as the bosses of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and State Street — were asked to raise their hand if they thought two additional rate cuts would be implemented by the Fed this year. No one put their hand up. "I think inflation is stickier, honestly, you look at the kind of jobs report and the wage reports in the U.S., I think it's going to be hard for inflation to come down to the 2% level," Jenny Johnson, Franklin Templeton president and CEO, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday, saying she thinks only one further interest rate cut will take place this year. "Remember a year ago, we were all here talking about recession? Was there going to be [one]? Nobody's talking about recession anymore," she said. Larry Fink, whose mammoth BlackRock fund oversees over $10 trillion in assets, also sees one rate reduction before the end of 2024. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25 [basis-point cut], but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said at another FII panel last week. "We have government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost.' Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking," he noted. America's consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, was up 2.4% in September compared with the same period in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure is a tick down from the 2.5% print of August, implying a slowdown in price growth. The September reading was also the smallest annual one since February 2021. On Friday, new data showed U.S. job creation in October slowed to its weakest pace since late 2020. Markets largely ignored the bad news, as the nonfarm payrolls report flagged acute climate and labor disruptions. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said inflation will more embedded into the global economy than what market participants are currently predicting, meaning price rises could prove to be stickier than the consensus. "That doesn't mean that it's going to rear its head in a particularly ugly way, but I do think there's the potential, depending on policy actions that are taken, that it can be more of a headwind than the current market consensus," he said. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick went even further, declaring last Tuesday that the days of easy money and zero interest rates are firmly in the past. "The end of financial repression, of zero interest rates and zero inflation, that era is over. Interest rates will be higher, will be challenged around the world. And the end of 'the end of history' — geopolitics are back and will be part of the challenge for decades to come," Pick said, referencing the famous 1992 Francis Fukuyama book, "The End of History and the Last Man," which argued that conflicts between nations and ideologies were a thing of the past with the ending of the Cold War. Speaking on Eisen's panel Tuesday, Apollo Global CEO Marc Rowan even questioned why the Fed was cutting rates at a time when so much fiscal stimulus had propped up a healthy-looking U.S. economy. He noted the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act and an increase in defense production. "We're all talking about, in the U.S., of shades of good. We really are talking about shades of good. And to come back to your point on rates, we massively increased rates, and yet, [the] stock market [is] at a record high, no unemployment, capital market issuance at will, and we're stimulating the economy?" he said. "I'm trying to remember why we're cutting rates, other than to try and equalize the bottom quartile," he later added. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Stock futures were moving higher early Monday ahead of a busy week that includes the presidential election and a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) shares were lower after the Warren Buffet-led conglomerate reported declining earnings while reducing its holdings of Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) moved higher ahead of their inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow (DOW). Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares decline despite analysts seeing 26% jump in quarterly revenue in upcoming earnings report. Boeing (BA) shares were up ahead of a vote today from its machinists union on a new labor contract that would end a nearly two-month workers strike. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures trended higher premarket as market watchers are bracing for a week that includes Election Day on Tuesday and a key Federal Reserve interest-rate decision on Thursday. Investors look to build on the gains from Friday’s session, when stocks moved higher after all three major indexes closed October in the red. Oil prices were higher by more than 2% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with allies that include Russia, announced it would extend output cuts through December. Treasury yields were slightly lower, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury at around 4.28%. Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway reported that its profits fell in the third quarter as it trimmed its holdings of both Apple and Bank of America. Berkshire reported third-quarter operating earnings of $10.1 billion, down from $10.7 billion a year ago and $11.6 billion in the prior quarter. It also reported a record level of cash holdings at $320.3 billion, up from $271.5 billion in the second quarter. The Warren Buffet-led company also said it had paused share buybacks. Berkshire Hathaway shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Apple and Bank of America also traded lower. Chipmaker Nvidia will replace rival semiconductor manufacturer Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while paint producer Sherwin-Williams will also join the blue-chip index in place of chemical firm Dow. S&P Dow Jones Indices said the changes to the index will come before the start of trading on Friday, Nov. 8. Nvidia’s inclusion in the index comes as its share price has surged on demand for artificial intelligence (AI), while Intel’s shares have lost more than half of their value this year. Shares of Nvidia traded higher by more than 2% in premarket trading, while Sherwin-Williams shares gained more than 4%. Shares of both Intel and Dow traded lower. Palantir Technologies shares were more than 1% lower ahead of the software provider's third-quarter earnings report, due after markets close today. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha are projecting that Palantir will grow its revenue by 26% in the quarter to $704.9 million, while its expected earnings per share of 5 cents would be up from 3 cents per share a year earlier. Shares of Palantir are up nearly 40% since September, but of the 12 analysts covering Palantir, only two projected a further rise in the company’s shares, with the average price target of $27.55 coming in 34% lower than its Friday closing price. Shares of Boeing edged higher in premarket trading ahead of a vote today by the aerospace giant’s machinist union that could end the strike that has lasted nearly two months. The International Association of Machinists will vote on the new offer from Boeing that includes 38% pay increases, along with a ratification bonus that workers can elect to use as part of their retirement savings. The union rejected a previous offer from Boeing that included a 35% pay hike, extending the strike that began on Sept. 13. Boeing recently raised around $19 billion in stock and depositary share sales as the company looks to shore up its finances.

Stock futures were moving higher early Monday ahead of a busy week that includes the presidential election and a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) shares were lower after the Warren Buffet-led conglomerate reported declining earnings while reducing its holdings of Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) moved higher ahead of their inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow (DOW). Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares decline despite analysts seeing 26% jump in quarterly revenue in upcoming earnings report. Boeing (BA) shares were up ahead of a vote today from its machinists union on a new labor contract that would end a nearly two-month workers strike. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures trended higher premarket as market watchers are bracing for a week that includes Election Day on Tuesday and a key Federal Reserve interest-rate decision on Thursday. Investors look to build on the gains from Friday’s session, when stocks moved higher after all three major indexes closed October in the red. Oil prices were higher by more than 2% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with allies that include Russia, announced it would extend output cuts through December. Treasury yields were slightly lower, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury at around 4.28%. Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway reported that its profits fell in the third quarter as it trimmed its holdings of both Apple and Bank of America. Berkshire reported third-quarter operating earnings of $10.1 billion, down from $10.7 billion a year ago and $11.6 billion in the prior quarter. It also reported a record level of cash holdings at $320.3 billion, up from $271.5 billion in the second quarter. The Warren Buffet-led company also said it had paused share buybacks. Berkshire Hathaway shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Apple and Bank of America also traded lower. Chipmaker Nvidia will replace rival semiconductor manufacturer Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while paint producer Sherwin-Williams will also join the blue-chip index in place of chemical firm Dow. S&P Dow Jones Indices said the changes to the index will come before the start of trading on Friday, Nov. 8. Nvidia’s inclusion in the index comes as its share price has surged on demand for artificial intelligence (AI), while Intel’s shares have lost more than half of their value this year.

Title: Big Tech is spending eye-watering amounts on AI

Time Published: 2024-11-04T11:46:27Z

Good morning. We’re 24 hours away from Election Day in the United States. Is anyone concerned about someone hacking the vote?According to a recent Pew Research survey of more than 5,000 American adults, the answer depends heavily on a person’s party affiliation.Fifty-two percent of voters are “at least somewhat confident” that U.S. election systems are secure from tech threats like hacking, according to the survey. A whopping 73% of Harris supporters are confident in that security—20 percentage points higher than Biden backers in 2020, no less. Yet a mere 32% of Trump supporters feel similarly, way down from 60% four years ago. A silver lining? Most voters, regardless of party affiliation, believe local poll workers and state election officials will do a good job during the election. Phew. —Andrew NuscaP.S. AT&T CEO John Stankey will discuss the future of U.S. infrastructure at Fortune Global Forum next week, Nov. 11-12 in New York City. Interested? Request an invitation here. Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. The ROI of AI? Perhaps the single most pressing question in tech outside of who might occupy the Oval Office next year. Now that some of the world’s largest tech companies have shared their latest earnings, it’s clear the question is far from answered. The capital spending of four of the biggest U.S. tech companies—Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft—will likely top $200 billion this year, with little relief planned for 2025. Data centers are materializing. Power agreements are arising. Acquisitions are accelerating. It’s giving gold rush, as the kids say—and Wall Street is a little freaked out that ambitions are outpacing potential returns. (That is: “Delulu.”) On the final day of October trading last week, investors sold off enough tech stock to drive U.S. stock indices down and erase all of the gains they made that month. Microsoft shares dropped 6%, its largest one-day drop in years. Meta shares fell 4%. “This … is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term, that we’re growing it out,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a conference call. “But I just think that the opportunities here are really big.” To find solid ground, investors are looking at more tangible components of the revolution, such as semiconductor sales. But concerns remain. For example, even as Microsoft disclosed an annualized $10 billion in AI revenue, it acknowledged that rising costs and slowing growth would eat into its cash cow in the cloud. Funding the revolution might just be more challenging than fomenting it. —AN In the world of blue-chip stocks, one day you’re in, and the next day you’re out. (At least that’s what Heidi Klum might say if she were a day trader.) Nvidia, riding the AI boom that has proven so lucrative for the chipmaker, is set to replace semiconductor peer Intel on the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average. The swap will be in place for trading on Friday, Nov. 8. The DJIA, which comprises 30 large companies, is among Wall Street’s oldest indices. It remains a powerful signal of success even if it has been criticized over the years for being too narrow to properly reflect sweeping economic changes. Intel joined the Dow in 1999, the same year as Microsoft; the pair were the first Nasdaq stocks ever chosen for the Dow. (It also happens to be the same year that Nvidia made its IPO for $12 per share. Ah, hindsight.) At the turn of the millennium, IBM and HP complemented the new additions to make four tech components to the Dow; today you’d be hard-pressed to find a firm that wasn’t trying to be in the tech category. —AN Big Tech peers Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have raced to sign agreements with nuclear power plants in a bid to fuel their energy-hungry AI datacenters. On Friday, one of them hit a major hurdle. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a petition to connect a colocated Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center directly to Talen Energy's Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Berwick, Pennsylvania. The agreement, which would have increased the facility’s load capacity from 300 megawatts to 480 megawatts and diverted power from the regional grid, “could have huge ramifications for both grid reliability and consumer costs,” said Commissioner Mark Christie in a statement. (Talen responded by saying that the decision “will have a chilling effect on economic development.”) The U.S. government and industry seem to be aligned that the development of artificial intelligence is a matter of national security; what’s still to be worked out is who will shoulder the burden. Watch this space. —AN Chinese researchers have created a military AI tool based on Meta’s “open-source” Llama 2 13B large language model, according to Reuters. Meta’s claim that its Llama AI models are “open-source” is hugely controversial, because of its licensing restrictions and the fact that it doesn’t reveal the source of the training data. But that doesn’t change the fact that Meta is making its models available for free, along with the parameters (“weights”) that make it easier to customize them. Per Reuters, that’s what these Chinese researchers have done, creating a model called ChatBIT that can aid military decision-makers and intelligence officers. Meta’s licensing restrictions forbid using Llama in military contexts, but what’s the company going to do? This is sure to inflame the debate over whether “open-source” AI is such a bright idea after all. —David Meyer Ming-Chi Kuo, the TF International Securities analyst known for having a reliable line on Apple’s supply chain, says an affordable Apple Vision Pro is further out than you’d think. “Production of the cheaper Vision Pro has been delayed beyond 2027 for a while now,” he posted Sunday on X, the social media service. “This means Apple's only new head-mounted display device in 2025 will be the Vision Pro with an upgraded M5 processor.” Apple’s $3,500 “spatial computer” was announced in June 2023 and hit the market nine months ago. Though most reviewers found the augmented reality device to be awe-inducing, they just as frequently found it impractical for real-world use. Estimates by IDC in July said Apple would fail to end the year with more than 500,000 units sold. According to Kuo, that’s part of why this delay might be acceptable to Apple. “Simply reducing the price wouldn't help create successful use cases,” he wrote. “It's similar to the HomePod situation—even after launching the cheaper HomePod mini, Apple's smart speakers failed to become mainstream products.” —AN —Elon Musk can’t dismiss ex-Twitter CEO’s severance claim. Parag Agarwal may proceed, a judge rules. —The CHIPS Act hasn’t seen much action. $33b approved; $123m awarded. —Peloton’s new CEO is a Ford and Apple veteran. Two words: Digital services. —Is awkward Alexa-speak not long for this world? Amazon is reorienting its famous assistant around LLMs. —Steve Ballmer wants to improve democracy with data. He spent $40m this year on USAFacts, his not-for-profit civic initiative. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: The hour of reckoning in the US, oligarchs applying pressure and making demands, the cabinet reshuffle and Schinas, the tax troubles of Kasselakis’ father with the IRS

Hello, the hour of reckoning has arrived for the new leader of the free world, and naturally, this week, something quite dramatic would need to happen to shift the spotlight from this major event that occurs once every four years and politically, geostrategically, and economically impacts the whole world. Judging by the polls and predictions on both sides, we may find out the winner more than 48 hours after the polls close, though any forecast could simply end up being guesswork. We… – Now, as for us as a country, it doesn’t take a genius to see we’d prefer the Democrats and Kamala, though it’s neither in our hands nor the end of the world if things don’t go that way. After all, there are ties and balances, and our relationship with the U.S. has strengthened more than ever over the past few years, aided by the dynamic presence of Ambassador Tsounis. We shall see. An interesting week is dawning. In Athens… – In Athens, the government is currently occupied with various important, though not earth-shattering, governance issues. Meanwhile, bizarre tales, straight out of Latin America, are coming to light and have become the talk of the town. You might say it’s the old story of “same old, same old” in Greece. Another thing Greece has “always had” – and something this administration, as well as K.M. himself, will also have to deal with – is the wear and tear of a second term. This includes inevitable signs of arrogance, along with increasingly bold and demanding oligarchs and special interests. And naturally, the “regular” folks, whether businesspeople or media tycoons who aren’t asking for money or power, are fewer and fewer and are likely running low on patience. This calls for special caution, because, as we’ve seen before, internal opponents play a role here, and in this instance, some of them are even the same people. For example, Samaras, who toppled Constantine Mitsotakis’ government, wouldn’t hesitate to take down Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ administration if he could. Now, I don’t know if he has enough MPs at his Sunday gatherings, allegedly eating souvlaki and plotting (LOL), or if he could align with Karamanlis’ group, though the Rafina resident is more restrained and less impulsive than Antonis, who some say might even be angling for an interim prime minister role. Though personally, I’m not sure who or what this transition would be for. At any rate, there are eager oligarchs ready to lend support, and let’s not forget the opposition, which now includes Nikos Androulakis, who is flexible and notably open to media support and more. Well, the man is just doing his job, and if he manages to stabilize at 20% or higher, he’ll certainly be playing in the big leagues. Cabinet Reshuffle – Maximos Mansion – Schinas – Thus, the next big topic already buzzing in political offices and business salons around Athens is the upcoming cabinet reshuffle, which will most likely happen after the presidential election, in three months, meaning “wait and see,” especially with K.M., who not only keeps his cards close but also recalibrates based on timing, especially for reshuffles. One juicy tidbit I heard (amid other whispers of people rejoining the government, which has become somewhat cliché) concerns former Commissioner Margaritis Schinas. Rumor has it that Margaritis, now back in his hometown of Thessaloniki, is gearing up for a powerful ministerial position, possibly even as Foreign Minister, replacing Gerapetritis if K.M. decides to bring him back to Maximos Mansion – something that doesn’t seem all that far-fetched. Again, I emphasize that this is just information and not a “guarantee,” as we used to say, since there are still more than three months before any reshuffle. Kasselakis Sr. – Legal Troubles – As for developments in SYRIZA, while we’re all following them, they no longer have that freshness; they’re not “juicy” anymore. Still, here’s an interesting piece of news related to the democracy champion Stefanos. Today, the Council of State (sixth chamber, if I’m not mistaken) is hearing the case of Kasselakis’ father, who famously owes €11.5 million in taxes. This debt stems from an old issue regarding a villa he owned in Ekali, which the SDOE tax investigation agency found was owned by him via an offshore company, leading to significant penalties. Given that the five-member council had upheld prior rulings from lower courts (first-instance and appellate), it’s likely that today’s seven-member council will reach the same conclusion as the previous judges. Nevertheless, he has his day in court, so we wish him “good luck.” Only Two Portfolios Stick to the Business Plan – The red loan market is facing substantial challenges. At the Ministry of Finance, there’s a report by KPMG on the Hercules scheme, which notes that only two NPL portfolios – Frontier and Galaxy in the corporate sector – are progressing according to the business plan. All other portfolios are facing issues ranging from minor to major. Simultaneously, secondary market transactions have slowed down, Intrum has agreed on prices for the sale of seven portfolios but has yet to close the deal, discussions are underway for acquisitions between servicers, even major ones, and the market is generally getting tougher and more demanding. It’s only a matter of time before we see restructuring moves that will lead to stronger entities managing the next phase of red-loan liquidations. PPC enters a new business sector – Establishes “PPC INSPECTRA” – PPC is embarking on a new venture, with its management setting up an independent subsidiary following the operational split of its existing Laboratories, Certification, and Inspection Department (DEPE). The goal of spinning off this division and forming a new company called “PPC INSPECTRA” is to accelerate the expansion of DEPE’s activities (which would be difficult to achieve through organic growth alone) and to penetrate more effectively into the Laboratory Services, Inspection, and Certification (Testing, Inspection & Certification – TIC) market, where demand is high. Strategically, the aim is for the new company to become the preferred TIC provider and offer all the services required by clients in this market (a one-stop shop). Establishing this new subsidiary is the main topic of today’s extraordinary shareholders’ meeting, which is expected to give the green light. Additionally, it’s noted that with the spin-off, DEPE will be able to acquire and integrate other businesses operating in related fields, expand its client base, and grow geographically. This move is favored by the conditions in the Greek TIC market, which is highly fragmented, with the top three companies (Bureau Veritas, DNV, TUV Hellas) collectively holding a 30% market share, while more than 350 smaller firms operate in this space. Notably, DEPE has been part of the former Innovation Center (DKK) and the earlier Center for Testing, Research & Standards (KDEP), and has been providing testing services to PPC’s units and external clients for over 50 years. Since the project is already well underway, DEPE has applied for certification as an Accredited Certification Body from the National Accreditation System (ESYD). The Golden Dividend of… Retired Executives – The Sarantis brothers, Michalis and Takis, might now call themselves “retirees,” having handed over the leadership of the Hellenic Dairies Group (Olympus, Rodopi, Agno, Kliafas, Tyras, etc.) to their children a few months ago. However, they still have a say in strategic decisions and continue to reap the rewards of their years of hard work. This year, they are set to receive a “golden dividend” of nearly 6 million euros. The group is expected to surpass 600 million euros in revenue and 100 million euros in EBITDA this year. In terms of net profitability, based on the decision to distribute dividends, performance is expected to be remarkable, especially when compared to competitors who are now lagging behind. The Rothschild & Co Greece Headache – Rothschild & Co, the prominent investment bank with an expanded presence in Greece in recent years, appears to have a “headache.” Five years ago, it evolved from a simple office into a full-fledged subsidiary called Rothschild & Co Greece S.A. Last year, Marios Broustas was appointed CEO, while the long-time head of the Greek office, Nasos Zabaras, took on the role of Chairman. The subsidiary aims to make a stronger push into the M&A advisory sector, hoping to fulfill the ambitions set by its parent company, as, so far, the balance sheet isn’t exactly thriving. Official reports show a reduced turnover in 2023 of approximately 862,000 euros, with pre-tax losses of 900,000 euros and after-tax losses of 748,000 euros. The company raised its share capital by 2 million euros to reach 2.025 million euros and also received a 1 million euro loan from the parent company via an open credit line. Consequently, its equity turned positive, reaching 726,666 euros, although its working capital (current liabilities minus current assets) remained negative. It’s worth noting that the company has secured a commitment from its ultimate shareholder to provide financial support over the next 12 months to ensure uninterrupted operations. The Surprise – At year’s end, the Ministry of Finance plans a “surprise”: a General State Balance Sheet with almost zero deficit. This means Greece will not only present a primary surplus of 3% to cover interest and debt payments but also a general surplus, having serviced its loans. Many in the Ministry suggest using this surplus to repurchase high-interest loans from the past, thereby dramatically reducing both debt service costs and nominal debt. As major European economies (France, Italy, Spain) dangerously increase their public debt, Greece stands out as a fiscally disciplined economy that reduces its debt and grows at twice the EU average. This is the picture that Finance Minister K. Hatzidakis will present at today’s Eurogroup meeting. The next challenge is for all Greek households to feel this unprecedented fiscal improvement, a goal pursued by the new tax reform bill entering public consultation today. Why They Are Buying EYDAP and EYATH – The government has launched a large-scale water management project with EYDAP leading in the South and EYATH in the North. Inevitably, these major investments and changes will bring new pricing. The implementation has begun, with the new “Regulated Asset Base” (RAB) framework published a month ago, increasing assets by 30% over the current level. Institutional investors are already taking notice, systematically buying shares of EYDAP and EYATH. Despite a declining stock market, EYDAP gained +1.4% last month, reaching a capitalization of 612 million euros with 4,705 trades involving 713,000 shares. EYATH, the “smaller, more conservative” entity, maintains a capitalization of 117 million euros, with 52,316 shares changing hands within the month. Brigadier General Evangelos Mytilineos – Metlen Energy & Metals sponsored the renovation of the 7th Company building at the Hellenic Military Academy. The group’s subsidiary, ELEMKA, fully renovated 2,500 square meters of facilities, upgrading cadet dormitories, common areas, and improving energy efficiency. At the official opening ceremony, President Katerina Sakellaropoulou awarded Evangelos Mytilineos the honorary title of Brigadier General, along with a commemorative statuette and ceremonial sword from the Academy. “Black Friday” Turns Into “Black November” – Traditionally in the U.S., “Black Friday” falls on the last Friday of November, right after Thanksgiving, when retailers clear out old stock at huge discounts to make room for new inventory. In Greece, however, Black Friday has turned into “Black Week” and now “Black November.” Major chains, led by Public, have already started sales, with Kotsovolos announcing a major event at the Mall this week. All stores are launching offers since the usual mid-November sales won’t take place, while retailers aim to secure early holiday spending that consumers will receive in late December. What Buffett Fears—and Expects – Warren Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha” and renowned contrarian investor, didn’t buy a single stock during the third quarter. As American markets hit record highs and Wall Street experiences a buying frenzy, Berkshire Hathaway has continued to sell stocks, pushing its cash reserves to an unprecedented 325.2 billion dollars. Even with Apple—the market cap leader heading toward 4 trillion dollars—Berkshire has reduced its position, selling 14.3 billion dollars’ worth, leaving its stake at 69.9 billion dollars, or 25% lower than the previous quarter. In total, over the past two quarters, Buffett sold Apple shares worth 100 billion dollars. While selling stocks, Berkshire has simultaneously increased its holdings in U.S. Treasury Bills to 288 billion dollars. Those who view Buffett as a “wise investor” and follow his strategy closely may face a tough week ahead on Wall Street. Not All IT is Golden – Twenty-five years ago, in November 1999, at the peak of the dot-com bubble, Intel was added to the Dow Jones Index as a sign that “IT is the future.” Back then, Intel traded at 42.25 dollars. If someone had invested 10,000 dollars in Intel stock at that time, their investment today would be worth around 5,500 dollars (plus any dividends received). Today, Intel is being removed from the Dow Jones Index, replaced by the well-known Nvidia. Nvidia’s shares have surged +180% this year as tech giants demand its high-powered processors that fuel AI, the technology now seen as the future. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow in 1896, is a beacon for the U.S. stock market. Unlike the S&P 500, which weights companies by market capitalization, the 30-stock Dow Jones is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have more impact. This is why the Dow Jones includes stocks like Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, and Cisco Systems, while companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta are absent.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Collective fear stimulates herd instinct and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd.” — Bertrand Russell, Unpopular Essays Number of the Week: 95% THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week discusses the complexity of the sun and part of what we do not know. It presents the abstract of a paper by Donald Rapp who is concerned about rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Also discussed are the false notion of settled science, questionable classification of subsidies, rising electricity rates in the US, the use of the term unprecedented, and the questionable optimism of a recent report by the IEA, ********************* The Mysterious Sun: The Sun and the relationship between Earth and Sun are the dominant characteristics of climate change. According to the mathematical model developed by Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch three types of cyclical patterns describe how the Earth revolves around the Sun: According to a NASA website, each cycle has a different duration. Changes in eccentricity vary between 0.0034 (almost a perfect circle) to 0.058 (slightly elliptical) and the duration is 100,000 years. The eccentricity explains why seasons are different lengths. In the Northen Hemisphere summers are longer than winters. Changes in obliquity, tilt, are described as 41,000-year cycles. The tilt varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees from a North Pole – South Pole axis. And changes in the direction Earth’s axis is pointed (a wobble) is described as a 26,000-year cycle. According to the NASA Science Editorial Team. “Milankovitch’s work was supported by other researchers of his time, and he authored numerous publications on his hypothesis. But it wasn’t until about 10 years after his death in 1958 that the global science community began to take serious notice of his theory. In 1976, a study in the journal Science by Hays et al. using deep-sea sediment cores found that Milankovitch cycles correspond with periods of major climate change over the past 450,000 years, with Ice Ages occurring when Earth was undergoing different stages of orbital variation. Several other projects and studies have also upheld the validity of Milankovitch’s work, including research using data from ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica that has provided strong evidence of Milankovitch cycles going back many hundreds of thousands of years. In addition, his work has been embraced by the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Scientific research to better understand the mechanisms that cause changes in Earth’s rotation and how specifically Milankovitch cycles combine to affect climate is ongoing. But the theory that they drive the timing of glacial-interglacial cycles is well accepted.” Many researchers have proposed that not well understood changes in the Sun influence Earth’s climate in terms of years and decades. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its collaborators dismiss changes in the Sun as insignificant. The private CERES-Science team proposes that Sun’s energy has changed over the last 45 years in a paper published by the Astrophysical Journal: “Multiple New or Updated Satellite Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) Composites (1978–2023).” The CERES-Science team has posted the entire dataset. The entire dataset is often missing in some of the critical work that the IPCC uses such as the Mann, et al. hockey-stick. The abstract of the CERES-Science paper reads: Several total solar irradiance (TSI) satellite missions have been carried out since 1978. None of these missions have lasted more than one to two solar cycles (SCs), and each mission implies a slightly different absolute TSI baseline. Nonetheless, several satellite composites have been developed by compositing satellite data from different missions to form an almost continuous daily record for the satellite era. However, disconcertingly, each mission has implied slightly different changes in TSI between consecutive solar minima and solar maxima. Some groups have developed adjustments to individual missions that have substantially reduced these differences. Others prefer to use the original data published by the satellite science teams. Some TSI composites average together conflicting records, while others prioritize specific records over others. Here, we compare four existing composites to 17 new alternative series based on the available satellite data. These 21 TSI series are statistically sorted into six groups of three to four series each. We found that the six groups suggest different intercycle trends between solar minima. We compare the groups to eight daily resolved solar proxy-based TSI reconstructions and to daily sunspot numbers. Excellent agreement is obtained over one to two SCs, but significant differences are observed over longer timescales for each group. Therefore, we have assembled all these time series (old and new) into a large and new TSI data set for use by the scientific community. Versions scaled to 1 au (for studying solar variability) or in situ values at Earth (for studying solar/terrestrial interactions) are provided at daily, monthly, and yearly resolutions. The principal author, Ronan Connolly, has posted a video explaining this work. He explains that there are three hypotheses regarding sunspots and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI): Connolly concludes that based on satellite measurements all three are partly right and partly wrong. Generally, for one year data, the higher the sunspot number the lower the TSI. For ten-year data, the higher the sunspot number the higher the TSI. This paradox illustrates the complexity of the issue, and the need to examine all the solid data available and not limit the examination to specific time periods. Adding to the complexity is that occurrence of large bright areas on the sun accompanying small dark sunspots. These cannot be observed with ordinary method because the sun is too bright and can only be observed when dark lenses are used. The bright regions are called solar plages or bright floccule or chromospheric faculae. The chromosphere (sphere of color) is the second layer of the sun’s atmosphere above photosphere (the outer shell from which light is radiated) and below the solar transition region and the corona (the outmost layer). Connolly asserts bright floccule (solar plages) accompanying sunspots increase TSI more than the sunspots decrease TSI. Does the bright floccule, sunspot activity and TSI relationship remain the same over most solar cycles? We don’t know. This has been an ongoing debate since the late 1990s. There appear to be two different solar cycles and the TSI is different in each solar minimum. However, relying on the sunspot record is not good enough, and an increase in TSI may contribute to global warming. Further, the shortage of data from the satellite record is a problem prior to 1996. The question is which record since 1996 is most reliable because each satellite record shows slightly different behavior. There have been different types of adjustments to the satellite data with the adjusted data known as the PMOD adjustments showing almost an exact linear relationship between sunspots and TSI from 1978 to 2013. This adjustment requires a correction to the Nimbus 7 data for the instruments to become more sensitive. Douglas Hoyt, head of the Nimbus 7 team, stated that the Nimbus team was unable to find any physical change to justify the adjustment or any change in the method of calculating the results. (The abstract of one of his papers can be found at: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91JA02488 Connolly discusses that the CERES-Science team provides a new way to look at satellite data – updating past composites and providing additional ones to bring the total to 21. They brought them into six separate groups and calculated the average of these six groups. Five groups are significantly different than one group close to the PMOD calculations which the IPCC uses. The principle researcher of PMOD is now dead and Connolly is reluctant to directly address the methods of calculation because the principle researcher cannot reply. From the work of the CERES-Science team, one can appreciation how complex it is to understand the changing complexity of the principle driver of Earth’s climate. To say the science of Earth’s climate is settled is absurd. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Concern about CO2: Donald Rapp is an accomplished physicist. According to his biography on Amazon, Rapp has: “over 60 years of technical research experience. He was a full professor at the University of Texas and spent over 30 years at Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In his early career he worked in chemical physics, producing a dozen citation classics with up to a thousand citations, and textbooks on quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. Later, he worked on spacecraft technology leading to his book “Human Missions to Mars”. Since about 2006 he has worked mainly on climate change, ice ages and human missions to Mars. His positions on many key issues are contrary to mainstream trends. In particular, he is highly doubtful that life ever existed on Mars and thinks the NASA Mars Program is a boondoggle. He is also skeptical of alarmist claims regarding the dangers of global warming, but he is concerned about rising CO2. At age 88, he is still going strong with a new book coming out in February 2023.” The fourth edition of his book Assessing Climate Change: Temperatures, Solar Radiation and Heat Balance was published in November 2016. Donald Rapp informed Ken Haapala that his new paper addresses current climate change: “Estimate of Temperature Rise in the 21st Century for Various Scenarios.” The abstract reads: “The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a lengthy report on climate change in early 2023. This report hypothesizes five potential scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to the end of the century (2100) and estimates the global average temperature gain in the year 2100 from the mid-1800s for each scenario. The method of calculation in the IPCC report is obscure. The results are merely stated. The present paper provides a clear method for estimating the temperature gain each year from 2015 until 2100, along with yearly estimates of ppm of CO2. To facilitate the calculations, a set of scenarios of future emissions was chosen that is analogous to the scenarios used by the IPCC but is more amenable to computation. The basic assumption in this paper is that most of the temperature gain from the mid-1800s to 2015 (1.15 C – as reported by the IPCC) was due to rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and a relationship is thereby derived between warming and gigatons of CO2 emitted for the period: 1800s to 2015. If it is assumed that the amount of warming per gigaton CO2 from the past persists into the 21st century, then future warming in the 21st century can be estimated for any assumed future scenario of CO2 emissions. This paper provides a simple and clear estimate of yearly CO2 ppm and temperature rise from 2015 to 2100 since the 1800s for a set of scenarios that cover the likely range of future emissions.” An honest scientist, Rapp states the key assumption: “The basic assumption in this paper is that most of the temperature gain from the mid-1800s to 2015 (1.15 C – as reported by the IPCC) was due to rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and a relationship is thereby derived between warming and gigatons of CO2 emitted for the period: 1800s to 2015.” To TWTW the lack of comprehensive data and the tremendous uncertainties involved make it impossible to test this key assumption. The uncertainties and the inability to test key assumptions in the many assertions involved in climate change are the principle reasons why TWTW focuses so heavily on understanding the greenhouse effect, even though it evolves a field of physics that is distant from classical physics. As discussed in last week’s TWTW, the scale and dimensions involved are far different. The issue is important because fossil fuels which increase atmospheric CO2 are needed for reliable, affordable electricity. Perhaps one day they may be replaced by nuclear energy, even fusion. But that day is not today. For Rapp’s accomplished paper, see link under Defending the Orthodoxy; for last week’s discussion of importance of scale see https://www.sepp.org/twtwfiles/2024/TWTW%2010-26-2024.pdf *************** Settled Science? One of the exaggerations made by climate alarmist is that the science is “settled.” Charles Rotter of WUWT points out a new paper that terrestrial plants absorb 31% more CO2 than previously calculated. Rotter writes: “The discovery that plants absorb 31% more CO₂ than we thought reveals just how far off the mark climate models—and the policies based on them—can be. It’s not just a matter of revising a few numbers; it’s about rethinking the entire narrative of ‘settled science.’” If verified, this will require a recalculation for the “settled science.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** What Are Subsidies? Proponents of wind and solar have long claimed massive subsidies to fossil fuels and often included dubious arguments that the depletion allowance is one such subsidy. The depletion allowance is similar to depreciation of an asset, they both lessen the value of the asset. Writing for the UK Daily Sceptic David Turver provides a solid economic analysis of what is a subsidy and what is not. He states: “In simple terms, a subsidy is when the Government pays (or mandates consumers to pay) for an activity to occur that otherwise would not happen if the market were left to its own devices. Examples might include grants to theatre companies or awarding CfD [Contract for Difference] contracts to offshore wind. When it comes to oil and gas, the definition of a subsidy becomes a little controversial. The International Energy Agency (IEA) defines fossil fuel subsidies as ‘measures that reduce the effective price of fossil fuels below world market prices.’ It is certainly true that some countries, such as Russia and Iran, do subsidize hydrocarbons according to the IEA’s definition.” Turver provides a graph by IEA showing the Value of fossil-fuel subsidies by fuel in the top 25 countries, 2022. The US, UK, and Germany do not appear. Leading the list are Russia, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Turver provides an analysis comparing UK Fossil Fuel “Subsidies” and Taxes [paid] 2022. This shows the subsides amount to about 24.8 billion pounds while the taxes amount to about 49.8 billion pounds. In 2024 the expected subsidies are about 0.2 billion pounds while the taxes are expected to be about the same. It would be interesting to see such an analysis for the US, particularly the subsidies to solar and wind power compared to the taxes paid. For California, the results would be ridiculous, especially if the value of electricity, delivered or not delivered, is also calculated. On summer sunny days solar power in California often generates more power than needed and nothing in the evening when needed the most. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Rising Electricity Costs: Writing for Master Resource, Bill Peacock gives a grim analysis of rising electricity costs in the US, by grid sectors. He writes: “During the first three years under Biden vs. last three under Trump, average wholesale electric prices in the seven U.S. independent or regional service areas have increased by 72%. Retail prices are also higher. The average 2024 U.S. residential rate to date is 24% higher than in 2020. For all end users—residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors—prices are up 23%. This rate surge reflects the massive renewable energy subsidies authorized in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, signed by President Biden, which tripled the outlay of such federal largesse. Another factor is the administration’s natural gas policies, which banned imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal; joined with the European Commission to reduce Europe’s dependance on Russian oil; and put a pause on LNG permits. Natural gas combined cycle, the technology of choice in a free market, is as cheap as ever, representing the path not taken. Whether it is the unprecedented subsidies for renewable energy or the unprecedented war on American energy, the Biden administration’s policies are behind the increase in America’s electricity prices. Wholesale Prices Up 72% Wholesale electricity prices are the best indicator of the direction of electricity prices. State regulations on retail prices often shield consumers from immediate exposure to rising energy prices. Eventually, though, consumers will bear the full brunt of higher wholesale electricity costs either through higher retail electric prices, lower income, or higher prices for other goods and services.” “ERCOT, which covers most of Texas, had the highest average wholesale price over the last three years at $117. It also had the highest three-year increase at 208%. ISO New England had the second highest average price at $81, followed by California ISO at $80. CAISO also had the second highest three-year price increase at 81%. New York ISO was next averaging $68, although prices in New York City were considerably higher at $80.” Peacock gives a table showing estimates of U.S. Federal Energy Subsidies, 2020-2029: Renewables $244,874,000,000; Fossil Fuels, 22,474,000,000; Nuclear $19,116,000,000. He then states that: “From 2010 through 2019, solar received $82 per megawatt hour of electricity generated. That is 42 times the amount of subsidies per megawatt hour nuclear received, 112 times coal, and 211 times oil and gas. For wind, its multiples were 10 times nuclear, 26 times coal, and 48 times oil and gas. The ‘free’ wind and solar generation actually cost taxpayers $74 billion last decade in federal subsidies, without including the cost of the electricity or state and local subsidies.” This analysis shows the government subsidies to wind and solar are not the path to reliable, affordable electricity. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Unprecedented: A characteristic of yellow journalism and climate propaganda is the use of the term “unprecedented.” Heavy rains fell in the Valencia region of Spain, and immediately mainstream media shrieked “unprecedented.” The volume of water involved was not unprecedented, but due to human settlement in flood plains and increasing prosperity, the loss of human life and property may have been. According to an article in Reuters, the phenomenon known locally as DANA may have been the cause. DANA is a Spanish acronym for high-altitude isolated depression, and unlike common storms or squalls it can form independently of polar or subtropical jet streams. See links under Changing Weather. *************** Optimism v. Reality: The International Energy Agency (IEA) came out with the World Energy Outlook 2024 that TWTW finds unrealistic in assessing the replacement of fossil fuels with alternatives such as wind and solar. Among other issues, the problems of the unreliability of wind and solar have not been addressed. Storage of electricity is a vexing problem, and the only proven large scale storage is pumped hydro replenished by reliable fossil fuel or nuclear generation. Batteries for storage of electricity is tiny compared with the enormity of the scale needed, and replenishment of the stored electricity is seldom mentioned. Paul Homewood mentions a good critique by Art Berman “IEA Optimism vs. Reality: The Contradictions in the Energy Transition.” After presenting a number of factual issues and graphs Berman concludes: “The IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2024 offers an optimistic view of a smooth transition to renewables. This is at odds, however, with the realities of energy consumption, economic growth, and the hard limits of ecosystem capacity. Despite decades of investment, fossil fuel consumption remains stubbornly high, and expectations for renewables to sustain comparable economic growth are idealistic. The IEA and many renewable energy advocates ignore the fundamental problem of ‘overshoot’—the reality that human consumption has already surpassed the planet’s ecological limits. The optimistic projection for a renewable energy future reflects an inadequate understanding of the past and present. The idea that renewables can sustain continued economic growth without addressing the underlying issue of excessive resource use is dangerously naive. Economic expansion requires more than just cleaner energy—it demands vast material inputs and energy yields that renewables, in their current form, struggle to provide. By focusing only on decarbonization, these projections overlook the deeper challenge: a growth-based system incompatible with planetary boundaries. Until the obsession with endless growth and consumption is confronted, energy forecasts, no matter how green they appear, will remain built on wishful thinking.” See links under Questioning the Orthodoxy *************** Number of the Week: 95% In “#CheerfulCharts #13: US sulfur dioxide trends” links to and EPA chart: US Sulfur Dioxide Trends: National Tends. All regions of the US are below the minimum National Standard. This actual pollutant used to be a big problem in urban air in North America and Europe, but improved technology scrubbed from smokestacks and automobile exhaust, getting it out of the exhaust before it even got into the air we breathe. This is a success story for the EPA. Unfortunately, the EPA has gone on to disgrace its reputation by embracing the linear no-threshold model by regulating most amounts of particles in the air that are 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter PM2.5. But more egregiously. EPA has declared carbon dioxide, which is essential for photosynthesis, the source of food for all complex life, a pollutant. All without physical evidence of harm to humans. Further, EPA has declared all greenhouse gases are pollutants, but largely ignores the primary greenhouse gas, water vapor. Regulating water vapor is as far beyond the control of the EPA as regulating carbon dioxide emissions from China. See links under Questioning the Orthodoxy. Science: Is the Sun Rising?

How was cleaning up anything, let alone an industry that requires a lot of weird mineral inputs, going to be “easy”? And here you thought everyone was as absolutist as you are on the subject.

Specifically, NOAA’s global model, the UFS, is now in third or fourth place behind the European Center, the UK Meteorology Office, and often the Canadians. The plot below shows a comparison for the middle troposphere (at a pressure of 500 hPa) [shown in text] between the European Center and the NOAA. We are behind and not catching up. With the Chevron Doctrine Overturned, the New ‘Judicial Veto’ of Regulations Will be Detrimental to Science and Business By Henry Miller, ACSH, Oct 29, 2024 [SEPP Comment: The Chevron Deference protected agencies such as the EPA when they made destructive decisions, such as banning DDT and declaring that greenhouse gases are pollutants. Millions in developing countries died of preventable malaria as a result oof the EPA DDT pronouncement made without physical evidence that ordinary amounts of DDT were harmful to humans. Similarly, there is no physical evidence that ordinary amounts of water vapor and carbon dioxide are harmful to humans who exhale 100 times the concentration of CO2 than they inhale.

Long-time ally Venezuela slashed fuel shipments to Cuba by half this year as it struggles to assure supply at home.

There was just one problem: Only the U.S. and Germany are among the world’s top ten coal consumers. The UN counts as members both China and India, which together consume nearly 70% of the world’s coal production. Neither is a member of the G7. Nor does the “bold” G7 commitment explain how their self-imposed coal ban – which they want to impose on poor African nations – even matters.

ARTICLES 1. America Can’t Do Without Fracking Shale is crucial to the U.S. economy, and it allows Washington to buttress our allies across the globe. By Daniel Yergin, WSJ, Oct. 30, 2024 TWTW Summary: The Chairman of S&P Global and long-time writer on energy begins with: “This year’s presidential race features an oddity: a discussion about a ban on fracking. What’s striking is that such a conversation is happening at all. This talk takes participants through the Wayback Machine to the first two decades of this century, when hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling—together known as fracking—came to public attention. The U.S. was then the world’s largest importer of oil. Today it is energy-independent with, S&P Global estimates, more than 70% of its oil and more than 80% of its natural gas produced through fracking. The process has become essential to the nation’s energy supply and can’t be eliminated. Not long ago the prospect of U.S. energy independence seemed fanciful. For more than four decades every president aspired to it, but their goal seemed unattainable. Many observers considered the U.S. destined to grow more dependent on imports. In recent years, however, America has achieved energy independence on a net basis. U.S. output is closing in on 13.5 million barrels of crude oil a day, exceeding that of perennial big producers Saudi Arabia and Russia by several million barrels per day. Add what are called natural-gas liquids, and the U.S. produces around 20 million barrels per day. Textbooks used to hold that commercial production of shale was impossible. Innovation and investment over decades have proved otherwise. Yet despite this progress, many continue to underestimate how transformative shale oil has been for the U.S. economy and the American way of life. Consider a concrete example. My firm estimates that battery-powered and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will account for about 2% of the U.S. on-road light-vehicle fleet in 2024. If fracking were banned, the U.S. would need to import extraordinary amounts of oil to fuel our gasoline- and diesel-powered cars. In 2008, before shale-oil production began in earnest, the net bill for importing petroleum was $388 billion—more than 40% of the total merchandise trade deficit. Today the same bill, by contrast, is virtually nothing. There would be other costs to a phase-out of fracking. If the U.S. were to start importing again, the price of oil would doubtless rise, as we would be forced to compete for supplies with countries such as China, which is estimated to import more than 70% of its petroleum. The U.S. also exports a large amount of liquefied natural gas, mostly produced from shale. Without it, LNG’s positive effect on the trade balance would disappear too.” The author points out how disastrous a ban of fracking would be for the US allies in Europe and concludes with: “The same dynamic applies for U.S. allies in the Pacific. Japan and South Korea have come to rely on U.S. energy exports, which have proved essential for diversifying their supply and strengthening their security. Losing that contribution would make them more vulnerable, reduce their confidence in the reliability of the U.S., and likely push them toward importing from Russia. A ban on fracking would be both misguided and destructive for the U.S. and its allies. Recurrent out-of-touch debates on the topic need to be tabled in light of a central fact: Shale has become crucial to the U.S. economy and global energy security. It’s here to stay.” ************** 2. Climate Change Can Take Big Toll on Asian Economies, Inaction Could Cost More, ADB Report Says It could reduce Asia-Pacific’s gross domestic product by 17% in 2070, ADB says.

The estimated GDP of China was $114 billion in 1972 (50 years ago); it was $17,889 billion in 2023. About 157 times that of 1972.

When Badenoch was announced the winner of the Tory leadership contest…. “Butler declared, “A victory for Badenoch is an obvious, unprecedented and once inconceivable victory for racism,” adding that ‘Badenochism’ should be viewed as “white supremacy in Blackface”.

However, it was not until 2004 that the first attribution study formally linked a weather event … I founded World Weather Attribution in 2014 to shift the conversation. Our attribution studies are carried out quickly, over days or weeks, in the immediate aftermath of weather disasters to inform people in real time about the role of the climate crisis.

Even if the the Northern Hemisphere rate of ACE growth remained at the highest value yet attained during the August to October peak levels during November (which is not happening) the Northern Hemisphere Season total through November would be about 20% below the long term average. It is clear the Northern Hemisphere 2024 season total is going to be well below normal, The only question is how far below normal will it end. Considering how the alarmist media exaggerates every hurricane that occurs in the North Atlantic as being the worse ever it seems appropriate that the reality of the actual situation globally needs to be addressed in a context that shows how ridiculous absurd such claims really are.

Title: Here’s How Much J.D. Vance Is Worth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylemullins/2024/11/04/heres-how-much-jd-vance-is-worth/
Time Published: 2024-11-04T06:29:26Z

Update (Nov. 4, 2024): Two years ago, JD Vance was an Ohio venture capitalist best known for writing a book that helped explain the rise of Donald Trump to liberal coastal elites. Today, he’s a firebrand senator whose first and only election victory was bankrolled by PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel and who now has a shot of becoming Donald Trump’s heir apparent. Since we published his net worth estimate back in July, not much has changed on the financial front for him—media attention has mostly focused on past and present controversial remarks about abortion, women, immigrants and more. But a promotion to vice president would come with a compensation bump to $235,000 from his current Senate salary of $174,000. It would also set the 40-year-old up for a future White House run of his own—and all the monetary perks that come with it. Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, come from two different Americas. In Trump’s, fathers start passing down real-estate fortunes to their kids when they are toddlers. In Vance’s, fathers don’t even leave kids with their last names. Raised mostly by his mother’s parents, the Vances, J.D. Vance catapulted himself from Rust Belt poverty to coastal high society with a degree from Yale Law School, a marriage to another lawyer and the publication of “Hillbilly Elegy,” a memoir about Vance’s upbringing. The book came out in the summer of 2016 just as Donald Trump was surging in the polls, leaving liberals searching for something, anything, to explain Trump’s popularity in Middle America. “Hillbilly Elegy” made Vance rich—it reportedly sold more than three million copies—and turned him into a national figure. Today, he is worth an estimated $10 million. Given where he started, it’s a remarkable sum, one that solidifies Vance’s place in circles that might have made his younger self uncomfortable. Vance wrote in his book about how odd he found a particular kind of charity—wealthy families picking out gifts for low-income kids, not knowing what those kids actually wanted or needed. “I grew up in a world where everyone worried about how they’d pay for Christmas,” he wrote. “Now I live in one where opportunities abound for the wealthy and privileged to shower their generosity on the community’s poor.” V ance’s maternal grandparents moved from Jackson, Kentucky to Middletown, Ohio as part of the 1950s mass migration to industrial centers. His grandfather worked in an Armco steel plant his whole career, and they raised three kids. That included Vance’s mother, who had Vance, her second child, in 1984, at age 23, with her second husband. By then, the Steel Belt had begun to rust, eventually leaving Middletown “little more than a relic of American industrial glory,” as Vance put it. His childhood was chaotic, laced with dropouts, alcoholics and violence, problems he chalks up to both structural factors—economic insecurity, a culture that “encourages social decay”—and individual bad decisions. Vance’s father was largely out of the picture early, and his mother cycled through husbands, abusive episodes and rehab stints. A product of his environment, moving between homes, sometimes Vance was dysfunctional, too. The only relative stability he had came from his grandparents, who stressed education, but Vance racked up so many unexcused absences from class at one point that the school district threatened his divorced parents with prosecution. He finished his freshman year of high school with a 2.1 grade-point average. Life changed when Vance moved in with his grandmother as a sophomore. (His grandfather had died a few years earlier). He got a part-time job as a cashier, and his grades improved. Vance contemplated college, balked at the price and instead enlisted in the Marines, earning about $1,000 a month after taxes. He served in Iraq and used extra money he won from playing online poker to pay for his grandmother’s health insurance. He also learned how to save money, balance a checkbook and invest. “The Marine Corps,” Vance wrote, “taught me how to live like an adult.” He finished his service in 2007 and enrolled at The Ohio State University. Vance excelled, graduating in less than two years, then went to Yale Law School in 2010. Military service and financial aid helped Vance avoid accruing massive debt—and high-paying gigs at elite law firms during his Yale years helped, too. He graduated in 2013, and today, Vance has no student debt. Equipped with a law degree, Vance and his girlfriend, Yale classmate Usha Chilukuri, both clerked in Cincinnati for a year, then married soon after, changing their last names to “Vance.” The newlyweds moved to Washington D.C., where Usha clerked for then-circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Vance started at a corporate law firm. They purchased a home east of the Capitol building in August 2014 for $590,000, borrowing just over $600,000 to pay for it. The home is worth about $850,000 today, and they owe an estimated $480,000 against it—the only debt they appear to have on their balance sheet. Vance and his wife, Usha, appeared on the floor of the Republican National Convention Monday night, where he was acclaimed Trump's VP nominee. Next, the couple headed to the Left Coast, where Usha started at the San Francisco office of Munger, Tolles and Olson. J.D. pivoted to tech, finding like-minded conservative circles in Silicon Valley. He worked at a biotech outfit, then joined Mithril, a venture capital firm founded by Paypal billionaire Peter Thiel. I n 2016, Vance published “Hillbilly Elegy,” which launched him onto the national stage, turning a poor kid from Ohio into a more genteel spokesperson for the white working class than the rich guy from New York. Vance appeared on CNN and graced the pages of The New York Times, but he didn’t always enjoy his new role, unsettled by his proximity to what he now terms “the liberal establishment.” In 2017, Vance announced that he was moving back to Ohio and starting an organization to fight the opioid epidemic. It didn’t go well. Our Ohio Renewal raised $220,000 in 2017 and spent $45,000 on a survey, $71,000 on salaries and wages, $63,000 on management and $11,000 on advertising and promotions. His wife, meanwhile, left her law firm in 2017 to clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts, then returned to private practice in D.C. at the same firm. J.D. pivoted back to startups, joining AOL billionaire Steve Case in his efforts to invest in VC-starved Middle America. In 2018, Vance and his wife bought a $1.4 million home in Cincinnati’s left-leaning East Walnut Hills—his neighborhood voted for Joe Biden in 2020 by 40 points. Forbes estimates that the house, now owned by an LLC, is worth about $1.8 million. Online listings say the property contains 5 bedrooms and 4,700 square feet, offering plenty of room for Vance, his wife and their three kids. A year after buying the Cincinnati home, Vance started his own venture firm, Narya. His investments hinted at his political inclinations. He bet on Rumble, a right-leaning YouTube competitor that now serves as a key partner to Trump’s Truth Social platform. His firm also invested in Strive Asset Management, the fund provider that former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, another Ohioan, founded to take on the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard. By 2021, with somewhere between $3 million and $10 million of venture holdings and liquid assets, Vance moved on to a new challenge, politics. Thiel, his old venture partner, seeded a U.S. Senate run with $10 million, then pitched in another $5 million as the race heated up. Other billionaires who had crossed paths with Vance in the business world declined to donate anything. Something had changed about Vance. Once a “never-Trump” Republican, he began bowing down to the former president, ultimately winning Trump’s endorsement. It was enough to beat former Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, and Vance stayed loyal to Trump after winning. On Saturday, he blamed Joe Biden for the assassination attempt that nearly killed Trump. As a Senate candidate, Vance leaned hard into right-wing messaging on immigration, Ukraine and support for former president Trump. Vance’s triumphant return to Washington D.C. came with another real estate investment in a blue area—in early 2023, he dropped $1.6 million on a 2,500-square-foot home in Alexandria, Virginia, which voted by huge margins for Biden in 2020. Asked if Vance has friends in the area, one neighbor said, “No, God, no, no,” before noting that Sean Spicer lives nearby. Forbes estimates Vance’s home is worth about $1.8 million today, bringing his total real estate holdings across three homes to around $4 million. He may not need the house in Virginia for long. If Vance becomes vice president, as polls currently suggest he will, he and his family will be able to move into the Naval Observatory, the official vice presidential residence, 10 minutes from the White House and hundreds of miles from hillbilly country.

Title: For investors, does it matter who wins the US election?

Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is “tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime”. The reality, says Fink, “is over time it doesn’t matter”. Is he right? Ordinarily, yes. With stock returns, there are many more important factors than politics. Stocks usually rise no matter who is in power, so professionals routinely advise investors not to fret about politics. Some republicans believed Obama would be terrible for stocks. Some Democrats panicked when Trump was elected in 2016. Nevertheless, stocks rose in both instances. As Dimensional Fund Advisors founder David Bloom notes, “shareholders are investing in companies, not in politicians”. Stocks may well rise significantly during a second Trump administration, and many on Wall Street are enthused about possible corporate tax cuts and deregulation. Nevertheless, Fink’s nonchalance is misplaced. Trump is no ordinary politician. Tariffs, trade wars, huge budget deficits, increased inflation expectations, further deglobalisation, mass deportations – one sees why 23 Nobel economists recently penned a letter endorsing Kamala Harris. Worse, Trump’s authoritarian instincts are deeply problematic. As Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf warns, Trump “is at the very least ‘fascistic’ and can be credibly called a fascist”. Autocracy is not good for investors, with research showing a strong link between democracy and stock returns. Capitalism relies on independent courts and institutions to ensure fair rules and support a stable market environment. Replacing civil servants with political appointees could endanger reliable reporting of economic data. Additionally, investors should be alarmed by Trump’s desire to end the Federal Reserve’s independence and give the president influence over rate policy. Now, some argue Trump’s bark is worse than his bite. Even if there is institutional erosion, it might unfold slowly, so stocks may do just fine under a Trump presidency. A bad president can still be good for stocks. Still, ignoring political risks may no longer be wise; healthy markets require healthy democratic institutions.

Title: Great restaurants around Ireland for a night out
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/restaurants/2024/12/03/great-restaurants-around-ireland-for-a-night-out/
Time Published: 2024-11-04T05:00:00Z

Almost a year in, Niall Davidson has settled into his Canal Docks location. A new casual bar and bottle shop has just opened and there are plans for a test kitchen, which is an indication of where his ambitions lie. The food is as spectacular as ever, with freshly landed fish, seafood, pork chops and hunks of beef from six-year old ex-dairy cows cooked over a custom-built Rhys Allen levitation grill. Corinna Hardgrave Andra Bhavan has branched out to Abbey Street with its extensive menu of southern Indian dishes and it now has Ireland’s first South Indian cocktail bar. The menu stretches from breakfast-style dosas, idlis, and vadas to heartier fare as the day moves on, such as mixed thali platters, Gutti Vankaya curry, lamb Chettinadu, and birianis. If you know the Marlborough Street original, expect much of the same, with the bonus of cocktails. CH Gaz Smith has built a reputation for seafood and steak that few can rival. His dedication to delivering the freshest seafood extends to rising at the crack of dawn to get the catch direct from local boats, and on busy days, the contents of their indulgent seafood platters can change three to four times. With steaks from Hannan’s, and an extensive wine list, Big Mike’s is a spot for celebrations big and small. Joanne Cronin Foxrock locals are lucky to have this spot, run by Alan and Elaine Wang. Start with Castletownbere crab on sourdough or pan-fried scallops, and move on to the decadent shellfish risotto. The 45-day dry-aged rib-eye steak, paired with crispy onions and a rich Béarnaise, and sole on the bone are cooked with pinpoint precision. The well-priced wine list rounds off the experience. CH A long-established fixture in Ireland’s Chinese restaurant scene, China Sichuan offers elevated Sichuan cooking in comfortable surroundings. Second-generation owner Kevin Hui and his team of classically trained chefs have developed a menu that combines the best of Sichuan flavours with Irish ingredients. Look out for beef tenderloin with black pepper and merlot, Sichuan favourite dan-dan noodles or delightful luóbo gao (crispy turnip cubes). JC Aishling Moore is one of the sharpest culinary talents in the country, her cooking driven by a “whole catch” philosophy that keeps things exciting and unpredictable. Much of her menu depends on what the day boats haul in, allowing her to flex her creative muscles on the fly. Her approach to flavour is as agile as it is bold, starting with Rossmore oysters topped with elderflower vinegar granita, and moving on to larger plates such as pan-roasted hake, paired with tomatillo kakut and a punchy beetroot acchar. CH Gursha operates as a supper club with a €29.90 tasting menu, so you’ll need to book and pay in advance. Prepared by Ethiopian native Yagerenesh Tadesse, (known to all as Mamay), her slow-cooked, berbere-spiced dishes, brimming with onions and chillies, are mostly vegetarian and served family-style on vast platters of injera, the tangy fermented bread made from teff. The food is bold, hearty and shared. Their next big project is brewing Ethiopian honey wine (mead), which is still in the experimental phase. CH Eric Mathews’ and Richie Barrett’s restaurant exploded on to the scene a year ago, making an immediate impact with its fiery cooking and bold flavours. The menu jumps from light bites to sharing plates, with pasta and meats kissed by flames. The potato focaccia with carbonara butter feels almost criminal in its indulgence, while Matthews’ Irish coffee riff on tiramisu is rich and delicious. It’s brash, unapologetic, and full throttle flavour. CH Kevin Burke’s restaurant is the kind of place where getting a table feels like winning the lottery – it’s one of the hottest bookings around. It’s a buzzy room with food that is sharp and inventive. Kick off with small plates such as crispy rabbit paired with sauce gribiche, before graduating to heavier hitters such as hamachi belly. Downstairs, a private diningroom for six-to-10 people can be yours with enough advance notice, and a minimum spend to match the experience. CH When chef Gráinne O’Keeffe was seeking to name her first restaurant, it was only natural to name it after her late grandmother Mae. It’s housed above the French Paradox wine shop, O’Keeffe’s seasonal cooking complemented by wine pairings sourced from below. The glorious tarte Tatin and selection of handmade knives have become fixtures, and in good news for locals, she has recently added a Friday lunchtime service. JC When chef Luis Martin took over the former Old Couch Café, he maintained its quirky nature, all the while putting his Spanish stamp on the menu. Bringing experience from his time in the kitchen at three-Michelin-starred restaurant Cenador de Amos, he seamlessly integrates Irish produce into dishes such as rabbit and carrot escabeche or quail and dark chocolate. Plans are under way with a local farmer to grow vegetables for next year’s menus. JC Regardless of whether you are dining during daytime or night-time, the large glass windows at Ox provide a sense of openness to this beautiful, understated room close to the river Lagan. Refurbished in 2023, it is the canvas on which chef Stephen Toman and sommelier Alain Kerloc’h paint their magic. Look out for smoked Ballywalter veal with black garlic or lobster with broad beans and lemon grass. JC Owners Alice Jary and Richard Kennan draw on their vast experience and travels to produce contemporary dishes such as Velvet Cloud labneh and peaches, adorned with glorious green beans and hazelnuts, or flavourful shiitake and tofu dumplings with Szechuan vinegar and roasted seaweed. With bar and restaurant seating, plus a creative cocktail list, and open from lunch to late night, Rúibín is truly a gem in Galway. JC Fidelity Studio is now linked to Fidelity Bar by a sleek interior door, making it easy to drift between the two. Sister 7′s menu, a collab with Big Fan, features dumplings, bao and inventive sharing plates. Don’t skip the “lip sticks”, deep-fried vegetable cakes of fermented rice, celeriac, yam and tofu. DJs spin tunes from a bright orange booth, keeping the energy alive as the night rolls on. CH The Dunmore is a space built for celebrations – dramatic, lively and perfect for catching up with friends over fresh seafood and sizzling dishes from the charcoal-burning oven. Midweek, the early-evening menu – two/three courses for €29/€35 – is particularly good value, with Duncannon mussels, seafood pie, fire-roasted chicken and a Pat McLoughlin beef burger featuring. For larger groups, the mezzanine is your spot, hosting up to 20 people. CH Knockranny has taken a more laid-back approach with the rebranding of La Fougère into The Fern Grill, now focused on relaxed dining, local ingredients and a new cocktail counter. Head chef Seamus Commons fires up daily catches, dry-aged Irish Black Angus, and lamb on the Josper Basque charcoal grill. Choose from the a la carte or the €55, five-course Taste of Knockranny menu. CH Owner and chef Brian Murray describes his style as “cooked with grá and kissed with a little fire”. Since returning to his native city, he has transformed the former Old Thompsons Bakery building into a modern, stylish restaurant. The menus change regularly, offering dishes of black sole with surf clams or Fitzgerald’s lamb served family style. JC The Tannery has become synonymous with modern Irish cooking, combining a cookery school and elegant town house accommodation with Paul and Máire Flynn’s famous restaurant. Chef Damien Derwin has shouldered Paul’s legacy, maintaining the tradition of hearty and creative food made with local ingredients. The revamped website now makes it easier than ever to book an overnight B&B stay with dinner. JC Having spent many years travelling the world and working at Belfast’s Yugo, chef Sean Lafferty opened Umi to share his love for Asian flavours. Umi has a vibrant atmosphere that seamlessly reflects the creative food including binchotan grilled Wagyu steak, and crispy dumplings made with local pork and chilli nut oil. They even offer their own wine, Rainbow Pie, a fresh Austrian Blaufränkisch made by ex-employee Jack Mcateer, with plans to add a white wine. JC Morgan VanderKamer, president of the Irish Guild of Sommeliers, co-owns this Waterford spot, so the wine list is exceptional. Her partner, Stephen McArdle, ensures the food is equally impressive. The menu focuses on wild fish and seasonal ingredients, with dishes such as Kilmore Quay crab with pickled cucumber, free-range pork terrine with foie gras, and roasted monkfish with smoked almond romesco and fennel.

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Eastern Europe has recorded increased crypto adoption, with DeFi transactions as the key driver. The region received more than $499 billion worth of crypto assets between July 2023 and June this year. Moreover, Eastern Europe contributes over 11% of the total crypto value worldwide and ranks as the fourth-largest global crypto market. Eastern Europe has recorded significant growth in its crypto adoption within the past few months. In a recent report, on-chain analytics company Chainalysis indicated the region received about $499.14 billion between July 2023 and June 2024. Further, the report revealed that the region now ranks globally as the fourth-largest crypto market. Its digital assets activity accounted for 11% of the cumulative global inflows within the period under analysis. In detail, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity within Eastern Europe saw a remarkable surge. The region recorded over $165 billion of DeFi-related transactions, representing a third of its total crypto deals within the period. Amid the events of war and turbulence within the region, DeFi activity grew by almost 40% in Eastern Europe. Moreover, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) witnessed more inflows, especially from Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus. These positive indications placed Eastern Europe third in global DeFi adoption, only behind Latin America and Sub-Africa. Amid the growing DeFi engagement, centralized exchanges (CEXs) still dominate crypto activity within the region. The report indicated that the CEXs received more than $324 billion in crypto asset transactions. Russia and Ukraine pioneer crypto adoption and growth within Eastern Europe with remarkable crypto transaction volumes amid their ongoing war and turbulent events. According to Chainalysis, Russia recorded over $182 billion in crypto assets flows to emerge at the top. Ukraine trails in the second position, with transaction flows amounting to more than $106 billion. Also, DEXs in Russia and Ukraine posted inflows growth of over 173% and 160%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Chainalysis report indicated that Ukraine and Russia ranked sixth and seventh in the 2024 global crypto adoption index. Ukraine made the most drive in the market’s activity in institutional and professional transfers. The country’s prominent activity came from large institutional transfers of over $10 million and mid-sized institutional transfers between $1 million and $10 million. A leading CEX in Ukraine, WhiteBIT, acknowledged the positive overturn of crypto transactions. WhiteBIT told Chainalysis: “Institutional and professional crypto transfers in Ukraine have surged as many seek financial stability amid the ongoing war, with cryptocurrencies viewed as a safer alternative.” Also, WhiteBIt highlighted certain factors that fueled the spike in crypto adoption and transfers in the country. These include inflation, market volatility, war-related sanctions, and the increasing institutional attraction in Bitcoin ETFs from issuers like BlackRock. Citing order book data, the Chainalysis report also noted that Bitcoin acquisition via the Ukraine hryvnia surged drastically over the past year, above $882 million. This trend reflects that Ukrainians have potentially adopted Bitcoin as a reliable store of value and inflation hedge.

Read more Indian government bond yields were largely unchanged in early trades on Monday, as investors exercised caution ahead of the U.S. presidential election due on Tuesday. Read more The Indian stock market faced a broad sell-off, with the Sensex and Nifty 50 dropping over 1.5%. Nifty and Sensex have resumed their downward trend after a week of consolidation, largely due to heavy selling by FIIs. The expectation of another stimulus package from China is driving fund outflows from India to China, while FIIs are also booking profits ahead of the significant upcoming U.S. elections. Additionally, DIIs appear to be on the sidelines amid these major global events. Both Nifty and Sensex are approaching their 200-DMAs, around 23500 and 77000, respectively, where a temporary bottom may form. Bank Nifty is showing relative resilience, supported by attractive valuations.

US Department of Commerce rescinds proposed administrative reviews of the AntiDumping (AD) and Countervailing Duty (CVD) orders on quartz surfaces applicable to Pokarna Engineered Stone Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pokarna. Pokarna stock declined 1.31% on the NSE to ₹1,082.30 Afcons Infrastructure’s discount listing was in line with our expectations driven by market sentiments and lower than expected subscription. The subdued demand for IPO offer was mainly on the back of higher OFS by parent which is facing a challenging phase marked by significant debt and family business restructuring. The fund raised will help the parent better manage obligations, debt crisis in the other group companies. This objective was a hurdle for short term investors to bid aggressively. Despite the listing below issue price, we remain optimistic on the business long term growth. Long term rationale to invest and hold is justified mainly on the back of a Healthy order book supporting its future growth, strong Track record of executing complex, challenging and unique EPC projects both within India and internationally and Stable financial performance over the years along with a capable efficient management team to take the company to newer heights. For allotted investors, we recommend holding it for the long term as we believe long term growth is intact with Govt focus on infrastructure growth. Short term traders and investors can hold/accumulate more on dips with a target near to Rs 480-500.

Afcons Infrastructure Limited’s IPO was listed at ₹426, marking around an 8% loss from its issue price of ₹463, which aligned with expectations given the current market sentiment. The IPO received a moderate subscription of 2.7 times, primarily driven by interest from institutional and retail investors. The listing performance reflects the cautious market outlook, despite the company’s strong credentials as part of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group and a solid order book supporting future growth. While the discounted listing may disappoint short-term investors, the IPO’s reasonable pricing, along with Afcons’ stable financial performance and project pipeline, offer potential long-term value. Investors with a long-term outlook may consider holding onto their shares, as the company’s fundamentals could drive gradual value appreciation once market conditions stabilize. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intelegain.rb Conference call Replay available in Various speeds !

Investors with a long-term outlook may consider holding onto their shares, as the company’s fundamentals could drive gradual value appreciation once market conditions stabilize. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intelegain.rb Conference call Replay available in Various speeds !

The Reserve Bank of India data show that outstanding loans against shares and bonds as of end of August 2024 stood at ₹9,722 crore, growing almost 27 per cent year-on-year. This, at a time when the overall personal loans category has grown at 14 per cent YoY as of August 2024. Outstanding loans against shares stood at ₹5,713 crore towards the end of August 2015.

Title: The China threat and the EV slowdown— 2 takeaways from a busy few weeks in auto news

Time Published: 2024-11-03T17:21:01Z

It's been a busy few days for auto companies. Ford and Volkswagen each pulled back vehicle production plans this week. After the last shift on Friday, November 15, Ford will pause F-150 Lightning production until next year, while VW said it is considering historic plant closures in Germany that would lay off hundreds of workers. Meanwhile, Tesla fell behind China's BYD in quarterly revenue for the first time, and GM CEO Mary Barra warned of an unsustainable price war in the Chinese EV market. Amid the flurry of news, two themes stand out: the China threat and EV slowdown loom large for automakers. In China, the world's largest auto market, EV leaders BYD and Tesla are engaged in a bitter price war that initially weighed heavily on BYD's bottom line. But by August, BYD (which also sells hybrid cars) reported its best-ever passenger car sales, driving up revenue 24% in the third quarter to $28.24 billion, topping Tesla for the first time. It's the latest sign that after nearly two years of deflating the value of its cars, Tesla is finally starting to feel the pinch of a slowdown in the EV market. The Chinese EV market is more competitive than ever, according the GM's Barra, who questioned the sustainability of a broader price war in the region driven by an uptick in Chinese EV startups selling inexpensive vehicles. Inexpensive Chinese EVs have long threatened the US EV market. They aren't just well-priced; many are also good-looking and well-equipped. Ford CEO Mark Ford said last week that he's been driving the Chinese-made Xiaomi SU7 for six months and doesn't want to give it up. Some car companies already sell China-built EVs in the US, but Biden Administration bans on Chinese vehicles keep competitors like BYD from entering the market. Europe is also slapping tariffs on Chinese EVs as these cars upend their retail market. As Volkswagen loses ground to BYD in Europe, the automotive giant is considering massive production pull-backs, including closing three German factories for the first time in its history. In the US, Ford announced its own EV production pull-backs this week, stopping assembly of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck until next year in a bid to improve profitability for its money-losing EV segment. Both companies are coupling these production rationalizations with other cost-cutting measures. At Ford, managerial bonuses tied to quality and manufacturing costs will be slashed to 65% of last year's levels. VW has said it plans to lay off workers and may cut wages. Over-production isn't just a problem for EVs, though. Overall vehicle inventory levels remained elevated at the end of October, driving up manufacturer-funded discounts, according to JD Power. Dealers ended October with about 2 million units in stock, a 4% increase from September and a 25% increase from the previous year. Some companies are more affected by inventory bloat than others. Stellantis, which is navigating the toughest year in its short history, is specifically focused on reducing inventory levels in the US, and reported some progress on that effort in the third quarter.

Title: 2024 election: Top portfolio plays for a Trump or Harris victory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Buckle up. That’s the message from Wall Street pros as investors brace for a close 2024 presidential election. So far this year, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has rallied 21%, making 2024 the best election year through October since 1936. But that outperformance could be at risk, at least in the immediate term, as the too-close-to-call race is largely expected to trigger market volatility. Predictions market Polymarket currently shows a 62.3% chance that Donald Trump will win the election, and that has prompted a return of the so-called Trump trade. Treasurys dropped and gold soared once again last week as investors bet that Trump’s proposed policies surrounding tariffs and tax cuts could prove to be inflationary. “The key for markets will be certainty in the outcome from which to understand economic impacts and evaluate implications for the trend of economic growth and evaluation of sector winners and losers,” Rob Haworth, US Bank Wealth Management senior investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance. Given the key themes that have emerged from Trump's and Harris’s respective campaigns, I asked a number of strategists what a Republican versus Democratic presidency means for business and Wall Street and narrowed that list down to three trade ideas under each scenario. Read more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election Financials is viewed as a top trade under a Republican presidency on the expectations for looser regulation and increased M&A activity. According to a recent note from Fitch Ratings, a July 2021 executive order under the Biden-Harris administration encouraging greater scrutiny of mergers has impeded deal activity — guidance that is expected to change under Trump. “While no proposed mergers have been formally denied since the directive took effect, approval times have increased markedly and, in some cases, to the point of making deals non-viable, as market conditions turned during the review period,” Christopher Wolfe, head of North American banks for Fitch Ratings, wrote in a note. UBS Global Wealth Management ElectionWatch co-lead Kurt Reiman told me financials stand out as a “key beneficiary” in both a red sweep scenario (meaning Republicans control the White House, Senate, and House) and a Trump presidency with a split Congress. Reiman said a looser regulatory environment could lead to lower costs and greater ability to return capital to shareholders, as well as a higher likelihood that consolidation in the financial services industry would face less resistance. On the flip side, Reiman and his team see Democrats controlling the White House, Senate, and House as a “worst-case scenario” for financial services due in part to the probability of greater support for the Credit Card Competition Act — a bill he views as ushering in new regulations and stricter interpretations of current rules. Bank of America’s Jason Kupferberg echoed a similar sentiment. In a recent note to clients, Kupferberg and his team wrote that a Democratic sweep would be a “worst case scenario” for the payments sector for two reasons: higher probability of a tougher stance on the DOJ’s lawsuit versus Visa (V) and the potential for new laws to lessen Visa's and Mastercard's (MA) competitive edge in the US. The expectation of higher spending under a second Trump administration has sent gold (GC=F) prices to record highs. The precious metal closed the week at $2,734.44 an ounce, bringing its year-to-date gains to 34%. And the run may be far from over, according to Wealth Alliance president Eric Diton. “We just don't have a plan as a country to deal with our $35 trillion in debt and growing. … I haven't heard any talk about any kind of reduction in spending from either candidate,” Diton told Yahoo Finance. While neither candidate seems to have a plan to address the country's ballooning deficit, a recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Trump’s policies could add $7.5 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, compared to $3.5 trillion under Harris. Managed-care insurers could see some relief under a second Trump administration due to the likelihood of greater support for privatized programs like Medicare Advantage — an approach long preferred by Republicans. And that could give a boost to companies like Humana (HUM), UnitedHealth (UNH), and CVS (CVS). Oppenheimer’s Michael Wiederhorn named Humana as the firm’s "best idea" for a Republican sweep, noting that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries account for 87% of the company’s premium revenue. “The key ways that a Republican regime could support Mastercard include strong rate increases and a favorable regulatory environment,” Wiederhorn noted. It’s a pivotal election for the electric vehicle industry, and not just because of Trump’s close ties with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Rather, the former president’s promise to roll back the Biden administration’s EV policies on "day one" could have significant implications. “This week’s election, and the potential shift in government regulations based on who wins, will be more consequential to the automotive industry than any previous election,” iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer said in a statement. Earlier this year, RBC’s Tom Narayan told me Trump’s “erratic” behavior during his first term left the auto industry uneasy, and they view his past threats as a potential challenge to their business if he were to be elected. On the other hand, Harris has been supportive of the current administration’s efforts to expand access to EVs. She is largely expected to extend the Biden-era $7,500 tax incentive for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs — a credit that Guggenheim’s Ron Jewsikow has told me is a “key affordability enabler.” Wedbush’s Dan Ives sees a Harris ticket as a positive for General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Stellantis (STLA), and the EV industry more broadly, including Tesla. Harris’s promise to support the housing market and make home affordability a centerpiece of her economic agenda is a bullish sign for homebuilders, according to Oppenheimer. The team, led by analyst Tyler Batory, sees Harris’s plan to build 3 million new housing units and improve housing affordability as a key catalyst for the sector. The team named D.R. Horton (DHI) as a top housing play, making the case that the stock is “uniquely positioned” given its focus on entry-level housing. “The company’s lower ASP (pricing) should benefit from increased demand from a tax credit, and its scale would allow further ramping of home production,” Batory wrote. In the company’s third quarter earnings call, D.R. Horton CEO Paul Romanowski warned affordability and election uncertainty had prompted “some buyers to stay on the sidelines in the near-term," sending ripples across the industry. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF declined 1.6% for the week, bringing its one-month loss to -8%. More social support under a Harris administration will boost off-price retailers, according to Evercore’s Michael Binetti. “A blue sweep would likely benefit the lowest income consumers and within our space, Burlington Stores has the lowest income demographics and a bigger margin opportunity than Ross Stores,” Binetti wrote. Off-price retailers have outperformed this year as consumers hunt for value amid sticky inflation. Burlington Stores (BURL) posted better-than-expected earnings and raised its outlook during its most recent quarterly report, while Ross Stores’ (ROST) value offerings helped boost sales by 7%. Shares of Burlington have soared 100% over the past year, while Ross has jumped 21%. Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on Twitter @SeanaNSmith.

About a year ago, a dividend investor shared his detailed income report and story on r/Dividends – a discussion board for income investors with over 600,000 members. The investor said his investing account was started with $60,000, which he saved in his 403(b) retirement plan while working at his first job for eight years. He then rolled over this money into an IRA. The investor said this $60,000 rose to $1.2 million in 27 years from 1996 "without putting any new money." "During that time, I have experienced tremendous market ups/downs like the internet (tech) bubble/burst, housing bubble/burst, Great Recession and recent Covid-19 crash and recovery. During all these times, my focus was the growth of company stocks, mutual funds and ETFs. My core holdings were always SPY and QQQ about 50-70% and occasionally some speculative stocks about 20-30%," the investor said. Trending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends He highlighted that he stayed invested in the market during all these ups and downs. The investor said he is now retired and switched his focus to dividend investing in 2022. "My only regret is that I should have switched to dividend focus a little sooner when I had $1.5m, but I guess it's life. Its projected dividend yield is ~9%, but I will be content with ~8% dividend yield." The investor clarified that most of his portfolio gains came from when he focused on growth. "The only dividend I have received during my accumulation phase was from SPY & QQQ. I heavily focused on growth," he said. The investor’s portfolio screenshots showed his monthly dividend income of about $9,495 or $113,949 per year. Most of his holdings were dividend ETFs. Let's take a look at the portfolio. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI) was the biggest position in the portfolio of the investor earning $9,495 per month in dividend income. The portfolio screenshots showed he owned 5,323 shares of JEPI, worth about $288,187 at the time. The investor raked in about $32,933 in annual dividend income from the ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) was the second-biggest position of the Redditor, earning $9,495 per month in dividends, as his position in the covered call ETF was valued at about $268,275. JEPQ distributes monthly dividends, invests in Nasdaq companies and generates extra income by selling call options. The ETF yields about 9.2%. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) is one of the best ways to enjoy dividend income and capital gains through stock price appreciation as the ETF exposes some of the top tech stocks in the NASDAQ-100 index. The fund pays quarterly dividends and yields about 0.6%. The investor owned 544 shares of the fund, according to the screenshots he publicly shared on Reddit. During the discussion on his post, the investor commented about his conviction in the QQQ: "Since I am much younger than Buffett, I also have faith in QQQ. I have faith in American entrepreneurship and technological creativity. So, my core holdings are always SPY and QQQ." The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust One of the key perks of investing in The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is that it allows you to see your capital grow and get quarterly dividend payments. The fund has a dividend yield of about 1.2%. The Redditor earning $9,495 per month in dividends had 433 SPY shares in his portfolio, valued at about $181,868. The investment brought in $2,792 in annual dividend income for the investor. Ares Capital Ares Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCC) is a business development company with a dividend yield of about 9%. The investor had 5,820 shares of Ares Capital in his portfolio, worth about $109,532 at the time. The investment earned about $11,174 in income. Global X Russell 2000 Covered Call ETF The investor earning $9,495 monthly dividends had an $82,000 position in Global X Russell 2000 Covered Call ETF (NYSE:RYLD). The fund generates income by selling call options on the small-cap-heavy Russell 2000 Index. The ETF yields about 12%. Being a covered call ETF, RYLD can incur losses during down markets. Trending: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:HYG) provides investors with exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated high-yield corporate bonds. It tracks the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid High Yield Index, which comprises a broad range of below-investment-grade bonds. The fund has a dividend yield of about 6%. YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE:TSLY) is a popular YieldMax dividend ETF for high-yield seekers. With a distribution rate of over 60%, TSLY generates income by selling call options on Tesla shares. Over the past year, TSLY has been down about 42%, while Tesla is up 28%. Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund (NYSE:GOF) exposes investors to fixed-income and other debt securities. It invests in various credit instruments, including corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and other high-yield debt. However, it's a risky investment because it invests in ungraded bonds, also known as junk bonds. The investor, who earned $9,495 per month, had 776 shares of GOF in his portfolio. This investment generated $1,695 in annual income. iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strat ETF iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strat ETF (BATS:TLTW) invests in U.S. Treasury bonds with 20 years or more maturities. It also generates income by selling call options on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 20+ Year U.S. Treasury Index. The current interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through publicly-traded REITs. Arrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform, has launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly.

Title: Intel reportedly scaling back R&D teams in Israel — several hundred talented staff will go

But already this year dozens have left for Nvidia. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Intel plans to reduce its workforce by several hundred employees at its Israeli research and development centers, following similar job cuts at its facilities elsewhere, reports DigiTimes. This move is part of the company's general cost-cutting measures amid financial challenges, and it opens opportunities for competitors to attract Intel's talent. There is a catch, though, as dozens of Intel employees already left the company for Nvidia earlier this year, according to Globes. Intel's Israeli operations employ around 11,700 people, including 7,800 in R&D roles and 3,900 in manufacturing, with the latest layoffs expected to focus on R&D while leaving manufacturing staff largely intact as Intel readies for the completion of Fab 38 in Kiryat Gat, the report says. The exact number of people that will either be proposed to leave voluntarily, or retire, or just laid off is not known, but Globes reports that Intel is set to cut its Israeli workforce by several hundred positions. Intel has three R&D sites in Israel. Each of these Israeli centers has a specialized focus: Haifa works on CPUs, AI hardware, and software; Petah Tikva develops communications and AI solutions; and Jerusalem is involved in communications, software, and cybersecurity. The report does not specify which R&D sites will see more cuts, other than saying that layoffs are expected in these R&D centers. But let us try to detail at least one thing. Intel's Israeli R&D team is responsible for multiple breakthrough microarchitectures, such as Banias, Yonah/Merom, and Nehalem, just to name a few. Each of these was strategically important for Intel at some point. In fact, the Banias processor was the heart of Intel's Centrino platform, the company's first platform developed specifically for laptops, which pretty much revolutionized the market. Yonah/Merom put Intel back on the map of high-performance PCs and replaced the power-hungry Netburst microarchitecture that powered Pentium 4 processors. But while Intel itself is slashing its R&D talent in Israel, it should be noted that people are leaving the company, too. Nvidia has been hiring former Intel employees: in 2024 alone, at least 30 Intel employees moved to Nvidia's offices in Yokneam and Tel Aviv, with total hires from Intel estimated to range from 60 to 90, according to the Globes report which analyzed LinkedIn profiles. Nvidia is expected to hire more Intel employees as the layoffs continue, possibly bringing the number to about 100. As of June 30, Nvidia reported a workforce of 4,000 employees in Israel, reflecting the company’s growing presence in the region. Many Intel employees who moved to Nvidia are benefiting from more attractive compensation packages. For instance, a junior hardware engineer at Nvidia can expect a starting annual salary of NIS 566,000 (around $151,500), about 33% higher than the equivalent role at Intel. Nvidia also offers significantly more valuable share options compared to Intel, with packages starting at NIS 56,200 annually ($15,045). In addition to Nvidia, other major tech companies are also drawing former Intel employees. Apple, Amazon, and Intel's subsidiary Mobileye have recently hired from Intel's workforce in Israel. Some groups have joined Microsoft, Google, and Huawei, which operates a development center in Haifa. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Title: Markets brace for presidential election, Fed meeting: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Election Day is almost here. The looming question remains how a Donald Trump or Kamala Harris victory will shape the market narrative for the rest of the year and beyond. Investors should soon learn the answer, with Americans heading to the polls on Tuesday. In the week before the election, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 1.37% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5% despite hitting its first record close since June during the week. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just over 0.1%. It's not the only big event of the week. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy decision, with markets largely anticipating that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Earnings season rolls on with a week headlined by reports from Palantir (PLTR), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Moderna (MRNA). One of the top potentially market-moving events that strategists have discussed throughout the year has finally arrived with the 2024 presidential election slated for Tuesday, Nov. 5. But it's been an abnormal election year for markets. When analyzing the S&P 500's average intraday trading range, Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick found that this past October was the second-least volatile month leading into an election in the past 50 years. Zooming out further, research from Bespoke Investment Group shows the S&P 500 had its best start to an election year since 1932, with a 20% year-to-date return for the benchmark index through the end of October. Still, Election Day itself is considered a risk event for markets. Speculation has built that a "Trump Trade" has been forming in markets as the betting odds of the former president winning the election have risen. But some market strategists aren't convinced there's a clear read on what outcome investors will be rooting for come Tuesday. "I think the market would do fine with Harris," Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. "I think the market would do fine with Trump. I don't think the stock market is really pricing any presidential odds." Franklin Templeton chief markets strategist Stephen Dover told Yahoo Finance that the key for markets could simply be getting past the event itself. "Just having those elections settled, whichever way it goes, would be positive," Dover said. Baird market strategist Michael Antonelli agreed, telling Yahoo Finance that the riskiest scenario from the election is "one where we just don't know the winner." Markets are widely expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points when it announces its next policy decision on Nov. 7. The key question entering the meeting is what the Federal Reserve will (or won't) signal about its plans for future meetings. Given that data has continued to show an economy pacing for solid growth while inflation's path down to the Fed's 2% goal remains bumpy, markets have moved to price in fewer interest rate cuts over the next year than initially thought when the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18. As of Friday, markets see about three less rate cuts through the end of next year than previously thought. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Morgan Stanley chief global economist Seth Carpenter doesn't think markets will get much more clarity on the Fed's path in the coming week. "The strength in growth gives the Fed patience as it allows policy easing to be gradual," Carpenter wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Neither inflation nor unemployment is forcing the Fed's hand. We do not expect Powell to give specific guidance on the size or cadence of future cuts. Policy remains data-dependent, and neither the September 50 [basis point] cut nor the November 25 [basis point] cut indicates the future pace." The market's debate over how much easing the Fed will enact over the next year has sent the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) soaring since the last Fed meeting in September. The 10-year added about 7 basis points on Friday to close near 4.36%, its highest level since early July. Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield told Yahoo Finance that the move in rates, and the overall focus on the economic data driving them higher, is overshadowing what's shaping up to be another solid quarter of corporate results. With 70% of the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results, the benchmark index is pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 5.1%. This would mark the fifth straight quarter of earnings growth as the index continues to rebound from the earnings recession seen in 2023. "We went through a two-year period where earnings were flat," Mayfield said. "They were volatile. Now we have earnings on the rise again. They're beating analyst expectations at a pretty solid clip. Profit margins are expanding. So the big picture is things look pretty good." And that story appears to be staying intact for the fourth quarter too. Since the period began at the start of October, analysts have cut estimates by 1.8%, according to FactSet data. This is in line with the average cut to earnings seen over the past 10 years. "At a certain point, earnings have to take the baton," Mayfield said. "I think we're in a good position for earnings to do that."

Title: DAILY BEAST Tries to Claw Way Back to Relevance...
URL: https://dnyuz.com/2024/11/03/the-daily-beast-tries-to-claw-its-way-back-to-relevance/
Time Published: 2024-11-03T12:31:37Z
Full Content:
On a sunny morning in early October, Joanna Coles, clad in a stylish tomato-red coat, and Ben Sherwood, dressed more demurely in a corduroy jacket, convened at their regular breakfast spot, the no-frills Star on 18 diner on Manhattan’s Far West Side. The two veteran media executives were talking about their ambitious plans for The Daily Beast, the 16-year-old money-losing news website, in which they jointly acquired a minority stake in April. But along with the predictable optimism about the mission they are taking on and enthusiasm about early signs of audience uptick and subscriber growth, Ms. Coles, a former chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, and Mr. Sherwood, a onetime president of ABC News and Disney TV chief, also conveyed a sense of frustration. Frustration that they weren’t greeted by the staff they inherited as warmly as they expected. Frustration that the site’s tech problems meant they’ve had to buy multiple subscriptions just to log in. Frustration that convincing the newsroom of their editorial vision has been an uphill climb. Less than three weeks after the pair’s takeover, New York magazine published a detailed report on the friction between reporters and Ms. Coles over story suggestions that they deemed ridiculous, including an investigation into whether former President Donald J. Trump was having stress-induced flatulence during his criminal trial and a list of the most obese members of Congress. (Neither article ran.) It was clear that many of the sources for the report were inside the organization, with one unnamed staff member bluntly criticizing the new owners’ “warped vision” of the news site. “This thing came within a day of being sold to the private equity knacker’s yard, where it would have been stripped,” Ms. Coles said later in an interview at The Beast’s offices in Chelsea, using a British term for a junkyard. “In what way is it helpful to tape our conversations and to proudly boast that you are not going to even attempt to look at the stories that your new bosses are asking you to look at?” “To me, that’s just, like, ‘No wonder the place is going out of business,’” she added. For his part, Mr. Sherwood was aghast that Beast journalists had anonymously complained about a Daily Beast article on plans by Barron Trump, Mr. Trump’s youngest son, to attend New York University. The article relied on a source of Ms. Coles and was published without a byline. “That happens to be something that she knew stone cold — her source was solid,” Mr. Sherwood said. “The organization went into a convulsion over this because Joanna did not reveal her source and no one could stand this up with any of their sources.” But, he asked, “where is Barron Trump at school now?” Indeed, the 18-year-old was spotted on the New York University campus for the start of the school year in September. Mr. Sherwood wrote a Beast article confirming the April scoop. The Daily Beast, launched in 2008 by the longtime magazine editor Tina Brown and backed by Barry Diller’s IAC, became known over the years as a cheeky and aggressive tabloid with reporting on politics and national security that often had an impact belying the relatively small size of its newsroom. In recent years, it published a series of damaging scoops on the Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker and broke the news of the arrest of the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Named for the fictional newspaper in Evelyn Waugh’s “Scoop,” The Daily Beast gave a platform to a new generation of writers, like Taylor Lorenz, Jamelle Bouie and Molly Jong-Fast. When Ms. Brown started the site — after stints editing Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and, less successfully, Talk magazine — she preached a mix of “high-low” stories. “The Daily Beast at its best was mischievous, subversive and absolutely 100 percent dedicated, often to the point of sociopathy, to breaking big news,” said Noah Shachtman, its editor in chief from 2018 to 2021. “If you look back at this moment in previous election cycles, The Beast played an incredible role.” But the outlet continuously lost money, and audience traffic has declined over the last two years. Fed up with the losses, Mr. Diller tried to offload The Daily Beast, at one point considering a deal with the Hollywood publication The Ankler and then looking to sell to a private-equity-backed publisher before landing on the partnership with Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles. “It was imminent: We were selling The Beast,” Mr. Diller said in an interview. But after meeting with Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles, he felt their plan made sense. “I want to give it a last chance,” Mr. Diller said. “It’s very early in the process, but I am more than pleased that we made that decision.” Mr. Sherwood, 60, and Ms. Coles, 62, were jointly granted a 49 percent equity stake in the business, returning them to the day-to-day scrum of a media company. (None of the parties would disclose the financial details of the deal; IAC still retains majority control.) The two seem, on the face of it, an odd pairing. She’s a glamorous Briton who conquered the world of glossy magazines and is best known for her star turn as editor in chief of Cosmopolitan from 2012 to 2016. He’s a Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar who made “Good Morning America” the top morning news show while president of ABC News from 2010 to 2014, before being promoted to oversee Disney’s TV group. They struck up a friendship in 2013 after Mr. Sherwood was impressed by a speech Ms. Coles gave at a New York awards event. By his telling, he went back to his office and immediately wrote her a letter saying he was inspired by her story of coming from Yorkshire, England, to “the pinnacle of publishing in America.” The pair met for lunch and discovered a mutually voracious love for the news. “We would try to text each other stories that we thought the other wouldn’t have come across,” Ms. Coles said. “And he really doesn’t miss anything. His breadth of reading is astonishing to me.” He has “a sense of the absurd and the funny, which a lot of people don’t,” she added. The two talked about doing a journalism project together when Ms. Coles left Hearst in 2018, after she was passed over for the presidency of the magazine division, and Mr. Sherwood left Disney in 2019. But nothing quite came together. In the years that followed, Mr. Sherwood founded and sold Mojo, a youth sports start-up, and Ms. Coles executive-produced the Freeform show “The Bold Type” while heading up a so-called blank-check company and sitting on the boards of Snap and Sonos. The thought of returning to a newsroom thrilled both Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles, especially one that had the benefit of years of brand building under editors like Ms. Brown, John Avlon (now running for Congress), Mr. Shachtman (who went on to lead Rolling Stone) and Tracy Connor, who had come to The Daily Beast from the NBC News investigative unit. But Ms. Coles and Mr. Sherwood had to immediately confront the fact that the media landscape had changed significantly in their time away from it. In the past few years, BuzzFeed News has shut down, Vice Media filed for bankruptcy and other publishers did mass layoffs. And new competitors kept coming: Puck, Punchbowl, The Free Press, Semafor, the various writers building their singular empires on Substack (including, just recently, Ms. Brown herself). The Beast was on track to lose $10 million this year, Mr. Sherwood said, and had been losing money and audience for five consecutive quarters before the deal in April. “The plans that had been set in place were on a path to lose tens and tens of millions of dollars, and that path was no longer viable and IAC was no longer going to do that,” Mr. Sherwood said. That was the message he and Ms. Coles delivered when they met with the staff of The Daily Beast for the first time on April 15. They thought the newsroom would be relieved that it was now in the hands of experienced media executives with serious bona fides who were committed to revitalizing it. The Beast staff saw it differently. According to interviews with nearly a dozen former and current members, some of whom shared notes taken at the first meetings with their new bosses, and all of whom asked to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardizing their career prospects, Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles came across as aggressive and relentlessly negative about the state of The Beast and the work that its staff was doing. Ms. Coles, who serves as the chief creative and content officer and runs the editorial side of the operation, told the staff that she and Mr. Sherwood wanted more “funny” and would “flood the zone” with content, the staff members said. Mr. Sherwood, who is the publisher and chief executive, became visibly angry when discussing his personal grievance: the technology issues that bedeviled the site’s paywall and payment system. In the weeks that followed, Ms. Coles began issuing story ideas that many in the newsroom chafed at and suggested hiring a “Lauren Sánchez correspondent” to report on the fiancée of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Reporters started leaving, including the Washington bureau chief, Matt Fuller, and some of his political reporters. (Mr. Fuller’s replacement, Martin Pengelly, a journalist from The Guardian, lasted five weeks in the job.) In early June, The Beast’s editor in chief since 2021, Ms. Connor, was replaced with Hugh Dougherty, an editor from The New York Post and, like Ms. Coles, a veteran of the British press. Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles announced a voluntary buyout program with an aim of cutting costs by $1.5 million. By the beginning of July, The Beast’s head count was down about 35 percent through the buyouts and a handful of layoffs. Ms. Coles has a specific vision for what The Beast can do: shorter and sharper articles that focus on people, power, politics and pop culture, with a dose of satire to lighten the mood during a perilous time. She says she is fascinated by the extremes of wealth and power and behavior, and pointed to articles about A-list celebrities who gave Sean Combs cover and the troubles of Will Lewis, the chief executive of The Washington Post, as recent highlights. “I wanted something that curated a lot of news out there that wasn’t about the end of democracy all the time,” she said. Ms. Coles said she felt that The Beast had “some very good editors” over the years, but that its place in the media landscape had been diminished. “I certainly wasn’t reading it on a regular basis,” she said. “Another editor said to me when we came here, he said: ‘It’s the boring avatar of the resistance.’ I thought he summed it up in one.” She is trying to spark ideas and reinvigorate the newsroom’s culture, which she said had been affected when the pandemic caused more people to work remotely. Beast employees are now required to work in the office four days a week. “We have some really good people here who were here all along who are excited by the mission and re-energized,” Ms. Coles said. There are others she was not as fond of. Ms. Coles recounted that a political reporter did not call in to the newsroom on the Sunday that President Biden announced he would drop out of the presidential race. Ms. Coles was at her house in the Hamptons that day, hosting her friend Emma Tucker, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal and a fellow Briton, and the pair “turned my dining room table into an ad hoc newsroom.” “I was incredulous that a political reporter would not call in because it was the weekend,” she said. “To me it was madness that we would have political correspondents who didn’t want to cover that story immediately.” That political reporter, Jake Lahut, who has since left, referred The New York Times to the three articles he filed the day that Mr. Biden dropped out. “The most important lesson I’ve learned from this is how not to run a newsroom,” Mr. Lahut said. There has been “a Niagara of news,” as Ms. Coles described it, in the lead-up to November’s election, but The Beast’s newsroom is now less than half the size it was six months ago. And days away from the presidential election, the Washington bureau is staffed with just two people. “They saved us, to what end?” one reporter who has left The Beast asked. “What is The Daily Beast now, and is it better?” The lack of staffing during an intense news period has turned the newsroom into a churn factory, according to people with knowledge of the work environment, with pressure on employees to pump out articles to generate as much reader traffic as possible. The newsroom has been asked to publish at least 40 posts a day, which is what it was producing before the staffing cuts. According to a presentation given to the newsroom in September, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, The Daily Beast published more than 210 articles in three days around the presidential debate in September. Many of the articles on the website are now aggregated from content published elsewhere or written by freelance contributors, though there is still some original reporting. Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles have also contributed to the site, with Mr. Sherwood appearing to relish a return to his reporting days of decades ago: He has already written more than 50 articles, including updates on the Menendez brothers’ case (which Mr. Sherwood notes he has followed since 1989) and a post on the 100th birthday of the Caesar salad. The Coles-and-Sherwood Daily Beast has had its outside detractors. Ms. Jong-Fast, the MSNBC pundit and former Beast editor-at-large, said in an interview: “At a time when we need brave voices and serious journalism more than ever, it’s devastating to watch it devolve into tacky clickbait.” The NBC News reporter Brandy Zadrozny, another former Beast writer, posted a similar view on Instagram Threads in September: “It’s weird watching someone buy something you love, take that thing that was once good, and just slowly murder it in public. Anyway RIP The Daily Beast.” Despite criticism of The Beast’s editorial approach, Mr. Sherwood credited the heightened news cycle over the last few months with helping the site record four months of subscriber growth. Data from the measurement firm Comscore showed a recent bump in visitors to The Beast’s site, with 21.3 million in September, up from a monthly average of 13.8 million in 2023. “They have had a profitable month or two, which historically has not happened at The Beast,” Mr. Diller said. “That is quite significant.” Mr. Sherwood said they were stabilizing the business by getting the staff to the right size, fixing the technology powering the website and migrating to a new content management system. (The company recently added a president and chief operating officer, the tech entrepreneur Keith Bonnici.) Mr. Sherwood said they would focus on growth in their second year, such as exploring new revenue streams. “We are totally aware of how hard and adverse the conditions are,” Mr. Sherwood said, but “we’re more optimistic in the path than ever with independent, feisty, intelligent tabloid journalism.” Ms. Coles has focused on building buzz for the new Daily Beast. She regularly appears on cable television shows, and recently suggested without evidence on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Mr. Trump was “microdosing drugs,” a claim the host Jonathan Lemire had to quickly clear up. She has tapped her extensive Rolodex to sign up Samantha Bee, the television host and comedian, to co-host a podcast with her. Guests so far have included the “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver and the Democratic strategist James Carville. The Beast also was quick to jump on the non-endorsement scandals engulfing The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, posting a link to subscribe on X with the message: “The Daily Beast reports without fear or favor. Apparently, that’s something not all newsrooms can do.” Ms. Brown, the founder, said she had advised Ms. Coles on “reviving the talent” and getting a mix of seasoned reporters and young writers. “The Daily Beast is really an upscale tabloid with attitude,” Ms. Brown said. “I think it definitely needed a face-lift.” The post The Daily Beast Tries to Claw Its Way Back to Relevance appeared first on New York Times.

Title: Markets Brace For Earnings, Election, And The Fed

Time Published: 2024-11-03T12:08:16Z
Full Content:
This week features more earnings, the Presential election and a Federal Reserve meeting. Within the S&P 500, 170 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season begins slow, but 102 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), featured heavily in last week’s earnings. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple reported better-than-expected earnings. Tesla reported much better-than-expected earnings the previous week, and NVIDIA won’t report until late November. Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the better earnings made a significant positive change to the pace of earnings growth for the quarter. Magnificent 7: Q3 Earnings Growth Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported robust earnings growth on Saturday. The big story was Warren Buffett’s continued sales of Apple (AAPL); a deeper dive is available here. The S&P 500 fell by 1.4% for the week. The Magnificent 7 lost 1.8% due to declines in Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple. Market Returns Among the companies reporting this week are Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Airbnb (ABNB). The communications services, healthcare, consumer discretionary, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to the FactSet data, the earnings growth rate for the technology sector retreated to 6.4%, down from 15.5%, primarily due to a one-time charge at Apple. Apple had a $10.2 billion one-time tax charge related to a reversal of the European General Court’s aid decision. Looking at apples-to-apples profits excluding this charge, Apple’s earnings grew 12.3% year-over-year. 3Q 2024 Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from 4.9% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 3Q 2024 Sales By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.1% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, but an improvement over the previous week’s 3.6%. Earnings Summary While the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, the evidence unmistakably shows that investors should not make investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here. The election could add to market volatility, but stocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Stock Returns Around Presidential Elections While the October monthly jobs report was weak, with only 12,000 jobs created and a downward revision of the last two months, the storms and strikes negatively impacted the results. Despite the noisy data, the markets are pricing in high confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) at the meeting on Thursday. Another 25 basis points cut is expected in December, so Chair Powell’s remarks will be crucial to fine-tuning those expectations. Expected Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Robust earnings growth from most of the Magnificent 7 companies helped lift the overall outcome of the earnings season. This week remains busy on the earnings front with additional possible volatility from the Presential election and the Federal Reserve meeting. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently holds Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Emerson Electric (EMR), Yum! Brands (YUM), Becton Dickinson (BDX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. We're into the final hours before election day. Tens of millions of Americans have already voted. Business Insider will be covering this final stretch and the days that follow with a sharp focus on what the next president will mean for you. From the prices you pay to how to invest, we'll have you covered. And if you're looking for a break from politics, we'll also continue to bring you all of the most important stories in business. You can find it all on our homepage or on our app. On the agenda today: But first: Takeaways from a big week in Big Tech. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. The trillion-dollar giants of Big Tech reported earnings this week, beating estimates and committing billions to AI. The big winners: Those able to signal a strong return on that investment. Alphabet Google's cloud business benefited from AI adoption, posting a 35% year-over-year increase in revenues, while CEO Sundar Pichai said more than a quarter of the company's new code is now created by AI. The core advertising business held strong despite growing competition from the likes of OpenAI, Reddit, and more. Amazon The retail and cloud giant smashed expectations, sending the stock soaring on Friday. It also benefited from AI adoption, as cloud unit AWS posted a 19% increase in revenues. A strong performance in retail, where execs said shoppers were buying cheaper items at higher volumes, and a sharp focus on cost control had investors cheering. Apple Apple beat revenue and profit estimates overall, but a year-over-year decline in revenue in China left investors underwhelmed. All eyes are now on demand for the iPhone 16 and whether new Apple Intelligence features help juice sales. Meta Meta beat estimates, though user growth came in below expectations. Mark Zuckerberg promised to keep spending on AI and flexed Meta's huge cluster of Nvidia H100 chips. Microsoft Microsoft also beat estimates, but concerns around capacity constraints in AI and the return on its investments in the space led the tech giant's stock lower across the week. In preparation for its future of autonomous vehicles, Tesla has been leaning on a specialized group of test drivers, part of what's known internally as "Project Rodeo." BI spoke with nine test drivers, who described sometimes perilous scenarios and near-crashes while testing unreleased software. Here's what they said. Scaling the corporate ladder was once a cornerstone of the American dream. Now, 42% of Americans say they don't even want a promotion, according to a survey by global HR consultancy Randstad. That's higher than the countries known for being more chill about work, like Italy, Spain, and New Zealand. The anti-advancement shift has left bosses scratching their heads. If promotions won't motivate workers, what will? Packing up the corporate ladder. After years of upping the ante with everything from exercise classes to laundry services, tech companies are clamping down on freebies. It's part of a wider push to cut costs across the industry. The lavish perks culture, once aimed at subsidizing nearly everything, led to entitlement and rule-bending among some employees. In a new era of efficiency and layoffs, tech workers need to get used to a new, non-extravagant normal. Use it, don't abuse it. As tension builds in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States Army is training warfighters for combat if a conflict with China breaks out. BI's Graham Flanagan spent two weeks in Hawaii to document the Army's sprawling, $16 million war-games exercise across the island chain. Watch the documentary here. This week's quote: "We were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a 5-day in-office mandate." — Amazon employees in a signed letter to AWS CEO Matt Garman, protesting his return-to-office comments. More of this week's top reads: LinkedIn thinks using AI could fix our hiring crisis — and help your career. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: I, Coppola

Advertisement More from the Review Subscribe to our Newsletter Best of The New York Review, plus books, events, and other items of interest November 21, 2024 Current Issue Current Issue More from the Review November 3, 2024 Lionsgate Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina and Nathalie Emmanuel as Julia Cicero in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 “Beware of the cliché, the predictable”: that’s one of the notes about storytelling that Francis Ford Coppola keeps posted where he works, as he reports in his book Live Cinema and Its Techniques.1 Watching Megalopolis—Coppola’s first film in thirteen years, funded with over $100 million of his own money—I realized that it should be two rules, not one. Cliché and predictable are not, in fact, synonyms. Megalopolis is one of the least predictable films ever made, a disorienting jumble of sci-fi, romance, political drama, historical epic, body horror, musical, satire, surrealism, magical realism, filmed theater, illustrated lecture, and inspirational after-school special. Scenes veer from stagy speeches to slapstick violence, hallucinatory dance numbers to raunchy sex to flashy special effects. Baffling details flicker by—a tree stump in the shape of a swastika, a sudden murder with a tiny bow and arrow, repeated incest jokes—not only without explanation but often without acknowledgment. A character might set off on a crucial mission only to disappear, and then be summarily killed in a flashback. A ludicrous plot twist might be interrupted by a moment of startling beauty. The protagonist, Cesar, played by Adam Driver, can stop time—an ability given increasing symbolic weight but no elaboration, and which he never puts to any use at all. And yet, somehow, amid or perhaps beneath the chaos, the film is constructed almost entirely from clichés. Its hero is a wild playboy who is also a moody genius with a tragic, secret past; he has fabulous wealth, a loyal majordomo/father figure, a confusing amount of political power (it makes more sense if you have read the back of The Power Broker, less if you have read the book), a mother who is never satisfied, and a Nobel Prize. He wants to remake his city—how is never exactly clear, though it involves more parks, and perhaps a new form of moving sidewalk—but is resisted by the elite, who are corrupt or depraved or both: the depraved ones do cocaine in spacious, well-lit nightclubs, and the corrupt skulk around in dark fedoras. The mayor, Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), is corrupt not in any particular actions but as a basic feature, the way some people are tall or left-handed. He has a pragmatic fixer named, the credits tell us, “Nush ‘the Fixer’ Berman,” as well as a beautiful, pure-hearted daughter, who falls in love with the hero and, slowly but surely, wins her father over to the hero’s cause. America is a decadent empire—like Rome, which is why the film’s version of New York is renamed New Rome, and why some (but not all) of the characters have Roman names and occasionally take part in Roman-ish activities. Here we encounter a strange phenomenon: a set of symbols so obvious they obscure the things they symbolize. The high and the low of New Rome gather in a coliseum to watch gladiators wrestle: What does this tell us about life in the nonfictional America, where actors, pop stars, and Donald Trump can be found cageside at UFC fights, while millions watch from home? (In case we’d forgotten the phrase “bread and circuses,” New Rome’s fights and chariot races are followed by a literal circus.) The festivities also include a set of “Vestal Virgins,” led by a singer named Vesta who is celebrated simultaneously for her sex appeal and her ostentatious chastity, and who later pivots to a bad-girl image after a scandal—which would all be quite illuminating, perhaps, if Britney Spears or Miley Cyrus had never existed. The film’s setting, too, is a chaotic rearrangement of the deeply familiar: not just ancient Rome added onto New York, but a version of New York that seems to exist simultaneously in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2020s. It’s a city of overcoats and flash drives, deep fakes and dusty municipal archives—all, one assumes, to indicate the timelessness of this “fable,” as the opening credits declare it. It is a confounding thing to watch. * In his notes about Fountain City—the 1,500-page novel, also about a visionary attempting to create a new urban utopia, that he worked on for years before finally abandoning—Michael Chabon uses the term draftitis to explain some of the book’s deficiencies. It “is a condition seen in manuscripts that have been rewritten several times,” he explains, especially “in passages where the writer has changed his or her mind,” a problem that “plagued me most often in my work as a screenwriter.” The problems might seem superficial, but they are “often a symptom of a more serious condition, namely authorial alienation.” That alienation seems to afflict much of Megalopolis. Coppola has, by his own account, been gathering material for the project for over forty years, and “must have rewritten it 300 times.” Much of the original research and conception was done in the 1980s, but Coppola’s first serious attempt to make it wasn’t until 2001; the film was well into preproduction when the September 11 attacks happened, putting it on hold again. (One plot point, strangely rushed past despite its importance, involves an old Soviet satellite plummeting from space and destroying a chunk of lower Manhattan.) It is hard not to think of this span of time while you watch, as characters, tones, and themes drift in and out erratically, like several different movies superimposed on one another. Even the grandest moments of spectacle and drama—a love scene on girders suspended above a glowing city, a political conspiracy breaking out into mob violence—come through as thin and muffled, as if we were watching them from far away. Advertisement Part of this is stylistic. In the decades since Coppola’s run of masterpieces in the 1970s—The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather Part II, Apocalypse Now—he has been looking for a way to make an entirely different sort of movie. “There are any number of styles one is able to choose in the movie business,” he complains in Live Cinema, “as long as it’s realism.” He means that word quite broadly, it seems, to include any film based around naturalistic lighting, lifelike sets, or location shooting. (There are plenty of definitions, after all, that would exclude all four of his most famous films: a pair of romanticized gangster epics, a paranoid thriller, and a surreal war movie.) Some of the work-for-hire he produced after he went bankrupt in the 1980s was necessarily in the traditional Hollywood mode, but the films on which he has had the most freedom have been marked by flamboyant artificiality: the glowing soundstage pseudo-Vegas of One from the Heart (1981), the anachronistic in-camera special effects of Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992), the fairytale dreamscapes of Twixt (2011). Lionsgate Nathalie Emmanuel as Julia Cicero and Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 In his recent book The Path to Paradise: A Francis Ford Coppola Story—a partial biography, mainly focused on the shooting of Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart, with the production of Megalopolis acting as a frame—Sam Wasson explains this shift as a reaction to the chaos of Apocalypse Now.2 In that film, Wasson writes, Coppola “had had a hard time getting real life to look the way he wanted it to look.” (A droll understatement, for a location shoot that went months over schedule and millions over budget, killed a crew member and hospitalized its lead actor, and drove Coppola into near-breakdown and marital estrangement.) “Shooting at a studio,” as he did for One from the Heart, “it was easier to control all the elements of moviemaking—color, light, scenery, actors—the way a painter has to control every brushstroke on his canvas.” Or, perhaps, the way Cesar yearns to control his city. Megalopolis, likewise, was shot primarily on soundstages, and makes extensive use of digital backdrops. Any hint of the real world is carefully excluded, in favor of a glowing, golden-hued artificiality, otherworldly and airless in equal measure. Its backgrounds are never more than that, flat and distant from the actors no matter how many inventive flourishes are packed into them. Among other things, Wasson’s book offers a reminder of how intertwined Coppola’s career has been with that of George Lucas. Lucas’s very first job in Hollywood was as an assistant on Coppola’s 1968 musical, Finian’s Rainbow, and Coppola produced Lucas’s first two feature films, THX 1138 (1971) and American Graffiti (1973). They shared collaborators, most notably the editor and sound designer Walter Murch, and scripts (Lucas was at one point meant to direct Apocalypse Now). And both, as they became successful, attempted to change how movies were made: not just “pursuing similar if not identical goals in the advancement of post-production technology”—Coppola was a pioneer of electronic editing and quadrophonic sound mixing, as Lucas was of special effects—but creating their own alternatives to the studio system. Lucasfilm was a more staid, less artistically radical (and less financially reckless) endeavor than Coppola’s American Zoetrope, yet “we both have the same goals,” Lucas declared. “We both have the same ideas and we both have the same ambitions.” In fact, the closest thing there is to a precedent for Megalopolis is Lucas’s own high-budget passion project: the Star Wars prequels. They share with Coppola’s film a stultifying reliance on digital backgrounds. They share, too, a discordant mix of acting styles, as each performer struggles in their own way to deliver wooden, ridiculous dialogue—alongside Hayden Christensen’s “I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere,” we now have Driver’s “Go back to the cluuub.” In both, the filmmaker was insulated, through sheer monetary abundance, from any and all interference, untethered from corporate dictates and collaborative compromise. But the Star Wars prequels are still grounded in a familiar fictional setting and guided by Lucas’s instincts as a showman—they are meant above all to entertain. Megalopolis is after something else, something more ambitious and inward. Advertisement * Wasson describes Coppola approaching filmmaking from the beginning of his career as a personal “rite of passage…each [project] lived by Coppola in tandem with his creation.” But most of his earlier works started with other people’s ideas: the Godfather films with Mario Puzo’s novel, Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart with preexisting scripts, not to mention the various hired-gun projects that followed. Someone else’s vision was always there for Coppola to struggle with and build on, however much he eventually made it his own. Lionsgate Grace Vanderwaal, center, as Vesta Sweetwater in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 His films this century—three small-scale features, which he has said “were meant to teach me what making movies really was,” and now Megalopolis—are more directly personal. Each contains at least some aspect drawn straight from his own life. The very first line of 2007’s Youth Without Youth (based on a novel by Mircea Eliade, his only recent film not a wholly original script) speaks to its director’s fears: “Sometimes,” the elderly protagonist declares, “I admit to myself that it’s possible I will never be able to finish my life’s work.” Much of the dramatic situation of Tetro (2009)—a younger brother estranged, as Coppola was, from the older brother he reveres, both siblings oppressed by an arrogant composer father much like the Coppolas’—matches his biography, right down to the father’s declaration that the family has room for only one genius, him. The climax of Twixt comes with a flashback to the death of the protagonist’s child in a boating accident, which is how Coppola’s eldest son was killed. In Megalopolis, Cesar’s airy penthouse office, where he dreams up his vision for a new city, seems modeled after the one on top of the Sentinel Building in San Francisco that Coppola had renovated after the success of The Godfather—a room “so beautiful…Coppola would tell [the designer] he wouldn’t let anyone photograph it,” Wasson reports. And Cesar’s Renaissance man workshop full of excited young people expresses Coppola’s dreams for American Zoetrope, a place where “everybody—all the filmmakers—could do whatever they wanted,” and where schoolchildren were brought in to learn film production firsthand. Even minor details turn out to be plucked from autobiography, like a brief appearance by two young reporters from The Dingbat News—which is the name of the schoolgirl newsletter Sofia Coppola and her friends wrote on the Zoetrope lot in the early 1980s. And yet, perversely, as his work has become more personal, at times nakedly autobiographical, it has also become less affecting. These moments, which should be moving or even heartbreaking, are instead melodramatic, campy, or just confusing. It is as if the deeper he has gone into his own experiences and emotions, the further he has left the rest of us behind. He’s down there somewhere; we can hear his voice, drifting up in fragments. * One word that comes through quite clearly is “ideas.” That, we have repeatedly been told, is what Megalopolis is really about. Coppola has spoken about all the books he drew from while working on it—Herman Hesse’s The Glass Bead Game, Stephen Greenblatt’s The Swerve, David Graeber’s Debt, Bullshit Jobs, and The Dawn of Everything, along with “everything I had ever read or learned about.” Mayor Cicero and Cesar are self-evidently meant to represent ideas of how to approach urban life, and life in general: the worldly and cynical (“People don’t need dreams, people need help now”) versus the idealistic (“Don’t let the now destroy the forever”), with the deck stacked heavily in favor of the latter. The ideas stop there. There is little discussion about how cities actually work, or could work; about how societies change, or might be changed; about history or government or anything else. Cesar’s utopian vision seems to consist of a few stray quotes from Shakespeare and Marcus Aurelius, a vague notion that rooms could change along with their inhabitants, and an affection for parks. His grand Megalopolis project, revealed at the end of the film, looks like a slightly vegetal remix of the Vessel, from New York’s Hudson Yards—a hideous tourist trap that has been repeatedly shut down after people killed themselves by jumping off it. Lionsgate Giancarlo Esposito as Mayor Cicero in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 If you stay for the credits, you might notice one for an “architectural and scientific advisor”: Neri Oxman, the designer and former MIT professor who, after Business Insider accused her of plagiarism this past January, was vigorously defended by her husband, the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Her “Man-Nahāta” project—a set of studies of the possible future of New York City, including a group of circular models exhibited at SFMOMA in 2022, commissioned by Coppola though essentially absent from the film—imagines the city overrun, in the coming centuries, not just by climate change but by great waves of jargon: “the city undergoes time-based decomposition, its organic substances breaking down into megalithic architectural elements.” Perusing the website of Oxman, the design firm she launched this fall, is almost as baffling as watching Megalopolis, as genuine environmental concerns disappear into the fog of sentences like “a generative design process that unites human-centric cultural typologies with Nature-centric needs to maximize ecological thriving.” One of the most discussed scenes in the film is a brief press conference Cesar holds, around the midpoint. At a few screenings, this moment involved a sudden outbreak of live performance: someone would emerge from the audience and ask a prewritten question into a microphone, to which Cesar would respond onscreen. Coppola’s original plan was to use a version of Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant to allow the actual audience to shout out questions, with the most relevant of several clips of Cesar answering then played in response—a plan that was abandoned after a wave of Amazon layoffs included the engineers who were working with Coppola. It’s an audacious idea, but the most shocking thing about this scene is how Cesar actually responds, no matter his questioner. “Is this society,” he asks, “is this way we’re living, the only one that’s available to us? And when we ask these questions, when there’s a dialogue about them, that basically is a utopia.” That, basically, is the level of thought this film provides. We get repeated gestures in the direction of ideas, or rather Ideas, restatements of the need for discussion, but no actual discussion—no details, no complications, no development. At some point over the years, Coppola seems to have lost touch not only with who these characters are and what kind of world they exist in, but with why any of this mattered in the first place. This is one of the most peculiar things about Megalopolis: it is so unusual, so packed with incident, and so clearly of such vast importance to its creator, yet it feels so empty. Sometime later, Cesar repeats himself: “We are in need of a great debate about the future!” he announces in the film’s finale, and it is never clearer that Coppola is speaking through him to us. But all he’s saying is that someone should say something. * Megalopolis might, in the end, be most intelligible not as an analysis but as a symptom. In the story of Cesar the misunderstood genius, the dictatorial apostle of dialogue, we can see glimpses of a very particular understanding of the world. This is what it looks like to a self-confident man of a certain sort: someone who has been rich and famous for over half his life, someone who is convinced of his own benevolence, who still sees himself as an outsider, who says things like “What I do is create chaos and then try to control it.” (It is true that Coppola went bankrupt in the middle of his career, but there are bankruptcies and there are bankruptcies, as Trump has taught us. Coppola’s was not the kind where you lose your health care or end up homeless, but the kind where you have to direct The Rainmaker.) This is evidently what he worries about and how he thinks things work. This is the world—this is us—seen from the top of the tower. It is a world, for instance, in which a few chosen people—artists, who are the same as scientists—can achieve almost anything, as long as they have a beautiful woman by their side to inspire them, and to run home and make dinner. (She may still be a professional subordinate, if it’s early in the relationship.) It’s a world in which true change is decided by a couple of men—rich, powerful, and probably related to each other—arguing across a very expensive table. A world in which democracy is, on those rare occasions when one is forced to acknowledge it, never anything more than a mob of idiots, manipulated by a few degenerates. A world in which powerful oratory—powerful enough, on one occasion, to completely subdue that mob—involves reciting Hamlet’s “to be or not to be” soliloquy in its entirety, and asking questions like “What is time?” There are times when Megalopolis feels like it should be set not in New York, or New Rome, but in Silicon Valley. Cesar’s gleaming vision of the future has a distinct air of the tech campus. His vague, unbounded genius seems an emanation from the ego of a very well-funded founder, the kind of man who employs so many scientists and engineers he starts to think he is both. At other times, the movie feels set in a hazy memory of New York, a storybook city of animate statues and sneering villains, waiting for a caring father to set things right. Lionsgate Aubrey Plaza as Wow Platinum in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 It is also a world in which there is nothing more dangerous than a sexy second wife. This is a subject on which the film becomes unusually coherent: the subplot in which the financial reporter Wow Platinum seduces and manipulates the rich, elderly banker Crassus and uses his wealth for her own spiteful ends is the most forceful and sustained section of the story. That Aubrey Plaza’s writhing, maniacal performance as Wow is delightful does not change what a tired, misogynistic caricature she is, a barely human creature of lust and viciousness. She is also the only major character who is killed, and quite brutally. One might notice, as well, that this is a world in which sex scandals turn out to be bullshit—just another speed bump thrown up by the haters. When Cesar’s enemies accuse him of statutory rape, the charges are doubly dismissed: not only was the sex tape a deep fake, but the girl was lying about her age and was actually in her twenties all along. Here we might remember a few things: that the index to Wasson’s book has entries under “Coppola, Francis Ford, infidelity of,” including an account of a long-term relationship in the 1970s with an assistant; that he has declared that he intentionally cast “canceled” actors in Megalopolis, such as Jon Voight and Shia LaBeouf, to avoid it being “deemed some woke Hollywood production”; and that he has been accused by an extra of sexual harassment on the set of the film—which he has vigorously denied, and over which he has since sued Variety, which reported the allegations, for $15 million. Or perhaps a few of us might remember something he said back in 2006, when asked about Victor Salva, a filmmaker he supported professionally both before and after Salva was convicted of molesting a child actor while filming his first feature, Clownhouse (1989). “You have to remember,” Coppola told a reporter, “while this was a tragedy, that the difference in age between Victor and the boy was very small—Victor was practically a child himself.” Salva was twenty-nine years old at the time of the crime, his victim twelve. There may, in the end, be a benefit to Megalopolis’s chronic draftitis. With its long and messy gestation, it unintentionally tracks some of the most destructive changes of the past half-century: the smooth slide of countercultural idealism into technocratic arrogance, the ascent of the very rich into a cuckooland of mushy pseudo-thought and thin-skinned vindictiveness, the decay of Great Man hero worship into misogynistic backlash. Watching this film is a very effective—and very useful—reminder of how inimical extreme wealth is to democratic thinking, to clear thinking in general, and to basic human sympathy. “If I could leave you with one thought after you see my new film,” Coppola wrote in a statement that accompanied early screenings of Megalopolis, “it would be this: Our founders borrowed a Constitution, Roman Law, and Senate for their revolutionary government without a king, so American History could neither have taken place nor succeed as it did without classical learning to guide it.” For better or for worse, I doubt a single member of its audience has left the theater with that in mind. The more sympathetic might be thinking of the pathos of an octogenarian director devoting his millions to a story about a man who can stop time. Others might be laughing at the headline, briefly glimpsed in a montage, declaring “TEEN PREGNANCY SKYROCKETS!” or wondering at the genuinely astonishing shot, late in the film, of a pregnant woman underwater who turns out to be an image painted onto human bodies, and changes when they move. Or they might be thinking of Wow, and wondering who the real Cesars will vote for on Tuesday.

After a whirlwind week of tech earnings, it’s time to take a deep breath and fasten your seat belts again for another big ride. This week is expected to be intense, high-stakes, and perhaps exhausting as Americans head to the polls to decide the country’s 47th president. Election Day falls on Tuesday, Nov. 5. Hopefully, by the end of the week, the world will know who will lead the nation — Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. Current polls show an incredibly close race, suggesting a tight contest that could bring volatility to markets and emotions alike. The historic event will likely impact market sentiment, and investors will need to stay tuned to stock market movements and macroeconomic indicators. Election outcomes can significantly affect the market’s direction, shaping policies that impact industries, fiscal policy, and international relations. As results unfold, expect heightened activity in the markets and prepare for potential shifts in market strategy based on the election’s outcome. Palantir Technologies (PLTR-1.30%) is set to release its earnings report on Monday after the market closes. Known for its advanced AI tools used by military and intelligence agencies, Palantir has become a prominent player amid the tech world’s ongoing AI surge. Super Micro Computer (SMCI+11.72%), which faces the threat of delisting from the Nasdaq, is expected to report on Tuesday, although the exact timing remains unconfirmed. On Wednesday, Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.05%) and CVS Health (CVS-5.96%) will announce their earnings before the opening bell. Later that day, AMC Entertainment (AMC-4.91%), a popular “meme stock,” and QUALCOMM (QCOM+0.25%), a key player in wireless technology, will release their results after the market closes. Airbnb (ABNB+3.23%) is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday after the market closes, shedding light on its performance amid shifting travel trends. Finally, on Friday, Paramount Global (PARA+0.09%) and Trump Media & Technology (DJT-20.92%) will release their earnings, providing insights into their standing within the media and social media landscapes, respectively. This week, several significant macroeconomic reports are scheduled for release, beginning on Tuesday with the U.S. trade deficit figures for September. This data is crucial for understanding the country’s trade dynamics and overall economic health. On Thursday, two important reports will be issued: the weekly initial jobless claims and the consumer credit report for September. Moreover, investors will closely monitor the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision, as well as the subsequent press conference featuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This announcement will be pivotal in shaping market expectations regarding monetary policy and interest rates. Finally, on Friday, the preliminary consumer sentiment index will be released, offering a glimpse into consumer confidence levels.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: SMCI rating suspended, ARM stock downgraded

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Wedbush analysts said this week they feel “more bullish” about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, despite the mixed reactions following the tech giant’s latest earnings report. Microsoft posted first-quarter results that exceeded expectations, driven by robust growth in Azure. The cloud service reported a 34% year-over-year growth in constant currency, surpassing forecasts by 100 basis points. AI growth played a key role, contributing a 12% boost compared to 8% in the previous quarter. This performance underlined strong AI monetization trends that continue to support Microsoft's core cloud business. Despite these results, Microsoft shares fell Thursday, impacted by guidance for Azure’s December quarter growth in constant currency, projected at 31%-32%, which fell short of the most bullish investor expectations. Wedbush analysts, led by Dan Ives, pushed back against the negative interpretation, stating they “disagree with this initial take.” “The new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25 and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,” Ives noted. The analysts emphasized that December’s headline figures were solid, particularly in the core Intelligent Cloud segment. Any observed weakness was attributed to softer PC demand, which they described as “background noise” in the context of Microsoft’s broader cloud and AI growth. “We come away from this quarter more bullish (not less) after seeing this AI growth and Copilot monetization play out in real time for Microsoft. The bears will try to split hairs on any number but ultimately this is a tech stalwart in major growth mode,” analysts continued. Barclays analysts noted that shares of Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) could face volatility in the near term, despite the company’s strong third-quarter earnings report. Alphabet reported revenue and earnings per share (EPS) that surpassed consensus estimates by 2% and 15%, respectively. Revenue from Search and YouTube matched expectations, while the Cloud segment delivered a notable outperformance. Barclays pointed out that the transition to the new CFO went smoothly, though investors remain keen for more detailed insights into the company's operations. Given Alphabet’s ongoing legal issues, the company’s continued “high-level communication philosophy” was not unexpected, according to the analysts. The regulatory environment is likely to draw renewed attention in the coming weeks, as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) plans to present a proposed remedy package ahead of the Department of Justice’s (DoJ) specific requests. This could impact the stock’s performance. Because of this, analysts indicated that “the upside for GOOGL shares near-term is somewhat capped.” “The 20x EPS multiple reflects some of the regulatory and AI-related risks, which we continue to muddle through ever so slowly,” they added. Bernstein analysts downgraded their rating for Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) to Underperform from Market Perform, pointing to near-term “cyclical headwinds” that could impact the chip designer. While acknowledging that the long-term equity story for Arm remains “very appealing,” the analysts voiced concerns about the company’s revenue prospects outside of the artificial intelligence space. They cited challenges affecting industries such as automaking and technology, which heavily depend on processors built using Arm’s designs. “Putting all of this together, we do not believe that Arm is immune to these cyclical headwinds when it comes to royalties, specifically — although the long term story remains very attractive in our view,” the analysts wrote. Ahead of the company’s quarterly results set for November 6, Bernstein subsequently lowered its expectations for Arm’s royalties and licensing income. The UK-based company derives royalties from each chip sold using its technology, along with licensing fees for its semiconductor designs. The analysts also revised down their fiscal year 2025 revenue target for Arm. They noted that the company’s current stock valuation, at 45 times 2026 fully-diluted earnings per share, is “too steep.” Rosenblatt Securities has suspended its rating, price target, and estimates for Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock following recent developments. More concretely, the AI server manufacturer recently revealed in an 8-K filing that Ernst & Young (EY) resigned as its registered public accounting firm last week. According to the filing, the move was triggered by issues related to governance, transparency, and the completeness of communications from Super Micro to EY, alongside concerns about internal controls over financial reporting. In its resignation letter, EY stated that it was “unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management.” The firm also highlighted concerns regarding the board’s independence from CEO Charles Liang and “other members of management.” Super Micro has since begun the search for a new accounting firm and noted that it does not expect to restate its financials for fiscal year 2024 or prior periods. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann commented, “Due to the changes undergoing at EY, we believe EY may also be removing itself from riskier profile projects.” He added, “Given the uncertainty surrounding the company's financials, we are suspending our rating, price target, and estimates on Super Micro until we have an outcome that can determine our recommendation.” According to Needham & Company analysts, Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) is the one stock that has yet to fully realize the potential benefits from the AI-driven market shift. The firm recently issued a Buy rating on Qorvo and set a price target of $135, seeing the semiconductor company as undervalued. Needham suggests that Qorvo’s current valuation does not yet capture the anticipated “AI-driven super cycle in CY25,” which could transform the smartphone market. The analysts pointed out that Qorvo’s valuation compared to the semiconductor index (SOXX) is at multi-year lows, presenting a “compelling risk/reward” opportunity as sentiment in the mobile market shows potential for improvement. “Management has been confident for several quarters regarding content gains in FY25 and FY26,” Needham noted, particularly with its major customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Additional opportunities could emerge if the AI-enabled smartphone product cycle gathers momentum. Despite positive signs in the smartphone market, Needham believes that an AI premium has yet to be factored into Qorvo’s valuation, given the conservative estimates for CY25. While global smartphone unit growth is expected, “our CY25 unit estimates are flattish, giving upside to any type of AI-driven super cycle,” the note stated. This indicates potential for upward revisions in both Apple and Android product lines as AI adoption accelerates.

Title: Crucial Conclusions From Berkshire Hathaway’s 3Q 2024 Earnings

While Berkshire Hathaway's operating earnings declined for the quarter, its cash hoard rose above ... [+] $320 billion. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported earnings of $26.3 billion in the third quarter versus a loss of $12.8 billion in the same quarter of 2023. Operating earnings, which remove the distortion from market changes and better reflect the firm’s earnings power, fell by 6% for the quarter versus 2023. Providing an illustration of the value from share repurchases, per-share operating income for the year-to-date increased by 15% compared to 2023, while operating earnings grew by 14%. Warren Buffett leads Berkshire as CEO and Chairman with Greg Abel, Vice Chairman of Non-insurance, and Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman of Insurance. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q and Year-to-Date 2024 Earnings Berkshire’s most significant business by year-to-date operating earnings is insurance, followed by the manufacturing, service, and retailing segment. Berkshire Hathaway: 3Q 2024 Year-To-Date Operating Earnings A more detailed look into the various operating segments for the third quarter shows slightly worse results than in 2023. The insurance business is the primary driver of the relative woes for the quarter. Operating income, excluding insurance, fell by 3% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q and Year-to-Date 2024: Operating Earnings By Segment Insurance: In the three quarters of 2024, investment income was 41% higher than in 2023, primarily due to higher yields and short-term investment balances. Buffett predicted at the annual meeting in May that higher yields and cash levels should lead to higher investment income in 2024. Berkshire’s luck in avoiding catastrophe losses ran out in the third quarter, with estimated losses from Hurricane Helene of $565 million. Further, management forecasts that “pre-tax incurred losses from Hurricane Milton could be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion.” These losses should be reflected in fourth-quarter earnings. Further, National Indemnity Company, which is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, had a “pre-tax charge in underwriting expenses of $490 million in connection with a settlement agreement reached concerning certain non-insurance affiliates that filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in 2023.” GEICO continued its improvement thanks to “higher average premiums per auto policy, lower claims frequencies and improved operating efficiencies compared to 2023.” Geico suffered from rising claims severity and catastrophe losses, partially offsetting the better news. At the annual meeting, Ajit Jain, who manages Berkshire’s insurance businesses, stated that GEICO is “making progress” but “still behind” on the technology front. Jain set a timeline for being caught up in technology to the end of 2025. The most crucial positive news was that policies in force grew in the third quarter “driven by increased new business and stable retention rates.” The two most essential concepts in insurance investing are “float” and underwriting profit. In simple terms, float is created for insurance companies because insurance premiums are paid before any claims are made by the insured. Insurance companies can invest the float, sometimes for years, before insurance losses are reimbursed. Berkshire’s float was higher at $174 billion, $5 billion higher than its level on December 31, 2023. In general, the value of float increases as yields rise since an insurance company can earn more when investing the cash. Float per share increased to a new high of $121,034. Though not a factor this quarter, share repurchases aid the growth of float per share. Berkshire Hathaway: Float Berkshire has a history, unlike many insurance companies, of earning an underwriting profit, meaning that their float costs them nothing and makes them money in addition to allowing them to earn a profit off of investing the float. Berkshire has three main insurance businesses: GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Two of the three insurance segments earned an underwriting profit in the third quarter, but all three had profitable underwriting year-to-date. An underwriting profit means the insurance premium exceeds all insurance claims and expenses. For example, GEICO had a combined ratio of 81.0% in the third quarter, which means that only 81.0 cents of every dollar in insurance premiums were spent on losses and expenses. A combined ratio over 100% indicates the insurance company has an underwriting loss, as seen with the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group in the third quarter. Berkshire Hathaway Insurance - Combined Ratio Railroad: Berkshire owns one of the largest railroads in North America, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad, operating in the U.S. and Canada. Railroad freight volume and revenues improved for the quarter versus 2023. Greg Abel, who oversees the railroad and other businesses outside of insurance, said at the annual meeting that BNSF needs a cost structure that allows it to compete in the rail and overall transport sectors. Abel added that “excellent progress” has been made. There continue to be signs of progress in the third quarter as operating earnings and pre-tax margins improved. Utilities and Energy: As a result of acquiring the 8% minority interest at the end of September, Berkshire is the sole owner of the Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (BHE). The purchase involved cash, a promissory note, and Berkshire Hathaway B shares. Reflecting the more uncertain future of BHE due to political and wildfire litigation risks, the purchase was at a significant discount to the price paid to acquire Greg Abel’s shares in 2022. BHE generally provides steady and growing earnings, as one would expect from what primarily consists of regulated utilities and pipeline companies. In addition, BHE typically produces significant tax credits due to its renewable electricity generation. For this reason, Berkshire focuses on after-tax earnings, which is “how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated.” BHE had a solid quarter, but the soaring profits were primarily due to accruing $1.4 billion for wildfire losses in the third quarter of 2023, which flattered the year-over-year comparisons. BHE has set aside $2.15 billion since 2023 for possible losses from the wildfires involving PacifiCorp. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing: This segment consists of many diverse businesses, so this analysis will focus on the best and worst performers and some themes when looking at this segment. Manufacturing, Service & Retail: Pre-Tax Earnings Year-To-Date 2024 The service group saw the most significant decline in pre-tax earnings for the quarter, primarily attributable to TTI and the aviation services businesses. TTI is a distributor of electronic components, and management began noting weakness in the group in 2023 due to inventory levels and sagging demand. Berkshire expects these headwinds “to continue over the remainder of 2024.” It is not abnormal for distribution businesses to suffer from these issues after a period of supply chain issues and high demand, as seen surrounding COVID. The aviation services businesses, consisting of NetJets and FlightSafety, saw strong revenue growth, but increased costs caused a decline in earnings. The retailing group was another major drag in earnings growth. The most significant portion of the retailing segment is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (BHA), owning over 80 auto dealerships. BHA had 10.0% lower earnings in the third quarter, driven by lower gross profit margins on vehicle sales. Pre-tax earnings for the remainder of the retailing group collapsed by 61.9%. On the positive side, the consumer products group saw the fastest increase in quarterly pre-tax profits. According to management, the “increases were primarily attributable to higher earnings from our apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell and a 3.9% increase in year-to-date earnings from Forest River.” Berkshire’s aerospace exposure remains substantial despite selling its publicly traded airline holdings in 2020. Berkshire’s Precision Castparts (PCC) business has been a bright spot within the industrial products segment due to its exposure to the aerospace industry. Berkshire noted that “long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and considerable demand for air travel and aerospace products.” PCC’s pre-tax earnings rose by 25.1% relative to 2023, primarily due to “sales increases and generally improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies.” Berkshire Hathaway 3Q and Year-to-Date 2024: Manufacturing, Service & Retail Pre-Tax Earnings Pilot Travel Centers(PTC): Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America, under the names Pilot and Flying J. On January 16, 2024, Berkshire acquired the final 20% and now owns 100% of the entity. It is shown as a segment within the financials of the operating companies. Still, the January 2023 results are included in the non-controlled business results, so the year-to-date comparison is apples-to-oranges. Pre-tax earnings fell by 25.4% in the third quarter, driven by lower average fuel prices and increased expenses. Non-Controlled Businesses: This segment includes companies’ profits that must be accounted for under the equity method due to the size of ownership and influence on management. The after-tax equity method earnings have Berkshire’s proportionate share of profits attributable to its investments in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Berkadia. In addition, the January 2023 results from Pilot are included in the 2023 non-controlled business results. According to Bloomberg, Berkshire is Occidental Petroleum’s largest shareholder, with an almost 28% stake. More about the reasons for the Occidental investment is here. Other: The segment had a loss in the quarter produced primarily by foreign currency exchange rate gains generated from bonds issued by Berkshire Hathaway and denominated in British Pounds, euros, and Japanese Yen. These foreign currency swings are not a concern as Berkshire has significant assets and earnings denominated in these foreign currencies. Investment losses from non-U.S. dollar investments generally offset some of these gains and vice versa, depending on currency exchange rates. Acquisition accounting expenses are also reflected in this segment. These expenses are created by amortizing intangible assets connected to companies purchased by Berkshire. Finally, other earnings include “ Berkshire parent company investment income, corporate expenses, intercompany interest income on loans to operating subsidiaries when the related interest expense is included in earnings of the operating subsidiaries and unallocated income taxes.” Investment Portfolio: $552.5 Billion Investment Portfolio: Berkshire was a net seller of $34.6 billion in publicly traded stocks in the third quarter. Berkshire bought $1.5 billion of stocks while selling $36.1 billion. As Buffett said at the annual meeting, “We only swing at pitches we like.” Surprisingly, the majority of the sales were from Berkshire Hathaway’s sales sizable stake in Apple (AAPL). These continuing sales follow on the heels of liquidating almost fifty percent of its holdings in the second quarter. Before Berkshire sold some Apple stock in the first quarter, it comprised over fifty percent of its publicly traded portfolio. The scale of the Apple sales comes as a bit of a shock because Buffett said at the annual meeting that Berkshire’s holdings of American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO) were “wonderful” businesses but said Apple is an even better one. Since these sales were known from other filings, selling about $9.3 billion in Bank of America (BAC) stock was not unexpected. After the sales, Berkshire’s insurance company investment portfolio is down to 48% publicly traded stocks from 63% in the first quarter, while cash rose from 28% to 49%. The 13F filing with the SEC, released on November 14, will provide more details of the publicly traded stock portfolio changes. What To Watch: As a positive, GEICO has retained profitability and begun to grow policies in force in the third quarter. Returning GEICO to a growth company was crucial. The BNSF railroad profit margin had slipped relative to 2023 and the five other major railroads, but there looks to have been some improvement in profitability and efficiency in the third quarter. While BHE didn’t suffer from wildfire liabilities in the quarter, the threat hasn’t gone away and possibly imperils the attractiveness of future capital spending in the business. This wildfire problem is intertwined with a legal, regulatory, and political process, so any definitive conclusions could take years. Further, significant additional capital investments in liability-impacted utility areas should signal positive progress since Buffett stated, “We will not knowingly throw good money after bad.” The underwriting losses from Hurricane Helene were felt in the quarter, and Hurricane Milton will haunt fourth-quarter insurance earnings. Berkshire has a history of being a disciplined underwriter, so the short-term pain should lead to the ability to earn higher premiums to insure these risks in the future. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q And Year-to-Date 2024: Pre-Tax Margin By Operating Segment Summary: Berkshire’s stock price outperformed the S&P 500 in the third quarter, rising by 13.1% versus a total return of 5.9% from the S&P 500. Year-to-date through November 1, Berkshire’s price was +26.8%, while the S&P 500 had a total return of +21.5%. Quarterly results are generally not meaningful for Berkshire since it is managed with a focus on increasing long-term value and not meeting quarterly hurdles. This ability to take advantage of time arbitrage has served the company and shareholders well over the years. The goal in looking at the results is to see if the segments are generally operating as expected and consider the capital allocation decisions made by Warren Buffett. Buffett provided a blueprint for the goals of Berkshire’s management. The first goal would be to “increase operating earnings.” Secondly, success in the “decrease shares outstanding” goal would boost operating earnings per share faster. Lastly, “hope for an occasional big opportunity,” allowing for a sizable cash investment at an attractive expected return. This analysis will use Buffett’s blueprint as a lens through which to evaluate how Berkshire is performing. Increase operating earnings: Operating earnings were 6% lower than last year’s same quarter, but the first three-quarters were 14% higher, which is a solid start to the year. Buffett says that operating earnings are the “most descriptive” way to view Berkshire since it removes the short-term volatility of market fluctuations in the net earnings. Buffett added at the annual meeting that “we would expect our earnings should go up modestly from year to year.” Berkshire Hathaway: Trailing 12 Month Operating Earnings Decrease shares outstanding: Particularly since 2018, a significant capital allocation decision has been made to increase share repurchases. When Berkshire Hathaway actively repurchases shares, it signals Buffett believes its share price is below his intrinsic value estimate. If he is correct, the purchases are a value-creator for the remaining shareholders. Berkshire has stated that there would be no stock repurchases if it would cause cash levels to fall below $30 billion, so the firm’s safety will not be compromised. Year-to-date operating earnings were 14% above 2023, with per-share growth of 15%, aided by modest share repurchases. Berkshire repurchased no stock in the third quarter. Berkshire Hathaway: Share Repurchases Until an announcement in mid-2018, Berkshire had only made repurchases when the stock traded at less than 1.2 times the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. While that constraint is now relaxed, it is still a good indicator of the general range when aggressive repurchases will likely be seen. Berkshire’s price-to-book ratio was somewhat elevated during the quarter, so share repurchases were suspended. Berkshire only intends to repurchase shares when the “repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.” The price-to-book ratio remains a reasonable proxy for gauging Berkshire’s intrinsic value. Still, Warren Buffett’s judgment about its intrinsic value versus other available uses of capital can differ from that simple price-to-book measure. Buffett’s use of shares to purchase the remainder of Berkshire Hathaway Energy is also likely a signal of how he sees the current valuation of Berkshire shares. He would be unlikely to be repurchasing shares and simultaneously using them as currency for a transaction since that would lead to a logical contradiction. Berkshire Hathaway: Price-To-Book Ratio A longer-term view of the positive impact of Berkshire’s share repurchases is illuminating. Since the start of more aggressive share repurchases in 2018, Berkshire’s operating earnings have grown at a 16.9% compound growth rate, while operating earnings per share have done 2.4 percentage points better at 19.3%. Berkshire Hathaway: Annualized Growth Rates Hope for an occasional big opportunity: Berkshire has a fortress balance sheet with cash and equivalents of over $320 billion. This cash hoard provides flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, including repurchasing its stock if the price declines to attractive levels. Buffett said at the annual meeting that there were no significant opportunities to invest the cash at attractive expected return: “I don’t think anyone sitting at this table has any idea how to use it effectively, and therefore, we don’t use it.” His opinion doesn’t seem to have changed, and based on the percentage of Berkshire’s cash holdings relative to the company’s size, he has continued actively reducing risk. Despite Berkshire shares being too dear relative to Buffett’s estimate of intrinsic value for share repurchases, shareholders should take comfort in knowing that the firm continues to be managed to survive and emerge stronger from any economic or market downturn by being in a financial position to take advantage of opportunities during a crisis. Berkshire Hathaway: Cash % Of Total Assets While the third quarter was a step back for quarterly operating earnings due to insurance underwriting losses, Berkshire demonstrates its resiliency. GEICO and the railroad showed signs of progress, which is not insignificant given the size of those businesses. Share repurchases might be off the table for now, removing one lever for Buffett to create value. Still, shareholders can take solace in the fact that share price increases led to this situation rather than value destruction. While no opportunities to employ capital were evident in the third quarter, Berkshire has $320 billion in cash on its balance sheet to take advantage of future opportunities.

While Berkshire Hathaway's operating earnings declined for the quarter, its cash hoard rose above ... [+] $320 billion. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported earnings of $26.3 billion in the third quarter versus a loss of $12.8 billion in the same quarter of 2023. Operating earnings, which remove the distortion from market changes and better reflect the firm’s earnings power, fell by 6% for the quarter versus 2023. Providing an illustration of the value from share repurchases, per-share operating income for the year-to-date increased by 15% compared to 2023, while operating earnings grew by 14%. Warren Buffett leads Berkshire as CEO and Chairman with Greg Abel, Vice Chairman of Non-insurance, and Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman of Insurance. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q and Year-to-Date 2024 Earnings Berkshire’s most significant business by year-to-date operating earnings is insurance, followed by the manufacturing, service, and retailing segment. Berkshire Hathaway: 3Q 2024 Year-To-Date Operating Earnings A more detailed look into the various operating segments for the third quarter shows slightly worse results than in 2023. The insurance business is the primary driver of the relative woes for the quarter. Operating income, excluding insurance, fell by 3% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q and Year-to-Date 2024: Operating Earnings By Segment Insurance: In the three quarters of 2024, investment income was 41% higher than in 2023, primarily due to higher yields and short-term investment balances. Buffett predicted at the annual meeting in May that higher yields and cash levels should lead to higher investment income in 2024. Berkshire’s luck in avoiding catastrophe losses ran out in the third quarter, with estimated losses from Hurricane Helene of $565 million. Further, management forecasts that “pre-tax incurred losses from Hurricane Milton could be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion.” These losses should be reflected in fourth-quarter earnings. Further, National Indemnity Company, which is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, had a “pre-tax charge in underwriting expenses of $490 million in connection with a settlement agreement reached concerning certain non-insurance affiliates that filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in 2023.” GEICO continued its improvement thanks to “higher average premiums per auto policy, lower claims frequencies and improved operating efficiencies compared to 2023.” Geico suffered from rising claims severity and catastrophe losses, partially offsetting the better news. At the annual meeting, Ajit Jain, who manages Berkshire’s insurance businesses, stated that GEICO is “making progress” but “still behind” on the technology front. Jain set a timeline for being caught up in technology to the end of 2025. The most crucial positive news was that policies in force grew in the third quarter “driven by increased new business and stable retention rates.” The two most essential concepts in insurance investing are “float” and underwriting profit. In simple terms, float is created for insurance companies because insurance premiums are paid before any claims are made by the insured. Insurance companies can invest the float, sometimes for years, before insurance losses are reimbursed. Berkshire’s float was higher at $174 billion, $5 billion higher than its level on December 31, 2023. In general, the value of float increases as yields rise since an insurance company can earn more when investing the cash. Float per share increased to a new high of $121,034. Though not a factor this quarter, share repurchases aid the growth of float per share. Berkshire Hathaway: Float Berkshire has a history, unlike many insurance companies, of earning an underwriting profit, meaning that their float costs them nothing and makes them money in addition to allowing them to earn a profit off of investing the float. Berkshire has three main insurance businesses: GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Two of the three insurance segments earned an underwriting profit in the third quarter, but all three had profitable underwriting year-to-date. An underwriting profit means the insurance premium exceeds all insurance claims and expenses. For example, GEICO had a combined ratio of 81.0% in the third quarter, which means that only 81.0 cents of every dollar in insurance premiums were spent on losses and expenses. A combined ratio over 100% indicates the insurance company has an underwriting loss, as seen with the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group in the third quarter. Berkshire Hathaway Insurance - Combined Ratio Railroad: Berkshire owns one of the largest railroads in North America, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad, operating in the U.S. and Canada. Railroad freight volume and revenues improved for the quarter versus 2023. Greg Abel, who oversees the railroad and other businesses outside of insurance, said at the annual meeting that BNSF needs a cost structure that allows it to compete in the rail and overall transport sectors. Abel added that “excellent progress” has been made. There continue to be signs of progress in the third quarter as operating earnings and pre-tax margins improved. Utilities and Energy: As a result of acquiring the 8% minority interest at the end of September, Berkshire is the sole owner of the Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (BHE). The purchase involved cash, a promissory note, and Berkshire Hathaway B shares. Reflecting the more uncertain future of BHE due to political and wildfire litigation risks, the purchase was at a significant discount to the price paid to acquire Greg Abel’s shares in 2022. BHE generally provides steady and growing earnings, as one would expect from what primarily consists of regulated utilities and pipeline companies. In addition, BHE typically produces significant tax credits due to its renewable electricity generation. For this reason, Berkshire focuses on after-tax earnings, which is “how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated.” BHE had a solid quarter, but the soaring profits were primarily due to accruing $1.4 billion for wildfire losses in the third quarter of 2023, which flattered the year-over-year comparisons. BHE has set aside $2.15 billion since 2023 for possible losses from the wildfires involving PacifiCorp. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing: This segment consists of many diverse businesses, so this analysis will focus on the best and worst performers and some themes when looking at this segment. Manufacturing, Service & Retail: Pre-Tax Earnings Year-To-Date 2024 The service group saw the most significant decline in pre-tax earnings for the quarter, primarily attributable to TTI and the aviation services businesses. TTI is a distributor of electronic components, and management began noting weakness in the group in 2023 due to inventory levels and sagging demand. Berkshire expects these headwinds “to continue over the remainder of 2024.” It is not abnormal for distribution businesses to suffer from these issues after a period of supply chain issues and high demand, as seen surrounding COVID. The aviation services businesses, consisting of NetJets and FlightSafety, saw strong revenue growth, but increased costs caused a decline in earnings. The retailing group was another major drag in earnings growth. The most significant portion of the retailing segment is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (BHA), owning over 80 auto dealerships. BHA had 10.0% lower earnings in the third quarter, driven by lower gross profit margins on vehicle sales. Pre-tax earnings for the remainder of the retailing group collapsed by 61.9%. On the positive side, the consumer products group saw the fastest increase in quarterly pre-tax profits. According to management, the “increases were primarily attributable to higher earnings from our apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell and a 3.9% increase in year-to-date earnings from Forest River.” Berkshire’s aerospace exposure remains substantial despite selling its publicly traded airline holdings in 2020. Berkshire’s Precision Castparts (PCC) business has been a bright spot within the industrial products segment due to its exposure to the aerospace industry. Berkshire noted that “long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and considerable demand for air travel and aerospace products.” PCC’s pre-tax earnings rose by 25.1% relative to 2023, primarily due to “sales increases and generally improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies.” Berkshire Hathaway 3Q and Year-to-Date 2024: Manufacturing, Service & Retail Pre-Tax Earnings Pilot Travel Centers(PTC): Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America, under the names Pilot and Flying J. On January 16, 2024, Berkshire acquired the final 20% and now owns 100% of the entity. It is shown as a segment within the financials of the operating companies. Still, the January 2023 results are included in the non-controlled business results, so the year-to-date comparison is apples-to-oranges. Pre-tax earnings fell by 25.4% in the third quarter, driven by lower average fuel prices and increased expenses. Non-Controlled Businesses: This segment includes companies’ profits that must be accounted for under the equity method due to the size of ownership and influence on management. The after-tax equity method earnings have Berkshire’s proportionate share of profits attributable to its investments in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Berkadia. In addition, the January 2023 results from Pilot are included in the 2023 non-controlled business results. According to Bloomberg, Berkshire is Occidental Petroleum’s largest shareholder, with an almost 28% stake. More about the reasons for the Occidental investment is here. Other: The segment had a loss in the quarter produced primarily by foreign currency exchange rate gains generated from bonds issued by Berkshire Hathaway and denominated in British Pounds, euros, and Japanese Yen. These foreign currency swings are not a concern as Berkshire has significant assets and earnings denominated in these foreign currencies. Investment losses from non-U.S. dollar investments generally offset some of these gains and vice versa, depending on currency exchange rates. Acquisition accounting expenses are also reflected in this segment. These expenses are created by amortizing intangible assets connected to companies purchased by Berkshire. Finally, other earnings include “ Berkshire parent company investment income, corporate expenses, intercompany interest income on loans to operating subsidiaries when the related interest expense is included in earnings of the operating subsidiaries and unallocated income taxes.” Investment Portfolio: $552.5 Billion Investment Portfolio: Berkshire was a net seller of $34.6 billion in publicly traded stocks in the third quarter. Berkshire bought $1.5 billion of stocks while selling $36.1 billion. As Buffett said at the annual meeting, “We only swing at pitches we like.” Surprisingly, the majority of the sales were from Berkshire Hathaway’s sales sizable stake in Apple (AAPL). These continuing sales follow on the heels of liquidating almost fifty percent of its holdings in the second quarter. Before Berkshire sold some Apple stock in the first quarter, it comprised over fifty percent of its publicly traded portfolio. The scale of the Apple sales comes as a bit of a shock because Buffett said at the annual meeting that Berkshire’s holdings of American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO) were “wonderful” businesses but said Apple is an even better one. Since these sales were known from other filings, selling about $9.3 billion in Bank of America (BAC) stock was not unexpected. After the sales, Berkshire’s insurance company investment portfolio is down to 48% publicly traded stocks from 63% in the first quarter, while cash rose from 28% to 49%. The 13F filing with the SEC, released on November 14, will provide more details of the publicly traded stock portfolio changes. What To Watch: As a positive, GEICO has retained profitability and begun to grow policies in force in the third quarter. Returning GEICO to a growth company was crucial. The BNSF railroad profit margin had slipped relative to 2023 and the five other major railroads, but there looks to have been some improvement in profitability and efficiency in the third quarter. While BHE didn’t suffer from wildfire liabilities in the quarter, the threat hasn’t gone away and possibly imperils the attractiveness of future capital spending in the business. This wildfire problem is intertwined with a legal, regulatory, and political process, so any definitive conclusions could take years. Further, significant additional capital investments in liability-impacted utility areas should signal positive progress since Buffett stated, “We will not knowingly throw good money after bad.” The underwriting losses from Hurricane Helene were felt in the quarter, and Hurricane Milton will haunt fourth-quarter insurance earnings. Berkshire has a history of being a disciplined underwriter, so the short-term pain should lead to the ability to earn higher premiums to insure these risks in the future. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q And Year-to-Date 2024: Pre-Tax Margin By Operating Segment Summary: Berkshire’s stock price outperformed the S&P 500 in the third quarter, rising by 13.1% versus a total return of 5.9% from the S&P 500. Year-to-date through November 1, Berkshire’s price was +26.8%, while the S&P 500 had a total return of +21.5%.

BREAKING: The Fed cuts its key interest rate again Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Nvidia is replacing rival chipmaker Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup to the blue-chip index that reflects the boom in artificial intelligence and a major shift in the semiconductor industry. The switch will take place on Nov. 8. Also, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc. in the index, S&P Dow Jones said in a statement. Nvidia shares have climbed over 170% so far in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia’s market cap has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple among publicly traded companies. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose 1%. Intel shares were down 1% in extended trading. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), such as the H100, in massive quantities to build clusters of computers for their AI work. Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and has at least tripled in three of them. The company has sginaled that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane.” With the addition of Nvidia, four of the six trillion-dollar tech companies are now in the index. The two not in the Dow are Alphabet and Meta. While Nvidia has been soaring, Intel has been slumping. Long the dominant maker of PC chips, Intel has lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices and has made very little headway in AI. Intel shares have fallen by more than half this year as the company struggles with manufacturing challenges and new competition for its central processors. Intel said in a filing this week that the board’s audit and finance committee approved cost and capital reduction activities, including lowering head count by 16,500 employees and reducing its real estate footprint. The job cuts were originally announced in August. The Dow contains 30 components and is weighted by the share price of the individual stocks instead of total market value. Nvidia put itself in better position to join the index in May, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split. While doing nothing to its market cap, the move slashed the price of each share by 90%, allowing the company to become a part of the Dow without having too heavy a weighting. The switch is the first change to the index since February, when Amazon replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance. Over the years, the Dow has been playing catchup in gaining exposure to the largest technology companies. The stocks in the index are chosen by a committee from S&P Dow Jones Indices. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: What to buy (and skip) in November 2024

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Many, or all, of the products featured on this page are from our advertising partners who compensate us when you take certain actions on our website or click to take an action on their website. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money. November is a great month for bargains. Black Friday happens this month after all, and the supposed single-day sale holiday seems to get stronger and go longer every year. Plus, online retailers like to keep you guessing and may drop a worthy deal on any given day. Your strategy to save money this month? Review your budget, make a list of what you want and remember to ABC: always be checkin’ (or just set deal alerts) for discounts. Consult this Nerdy list of the best things to buy and skip in November, too. Black Friday, which falls on Nov. 29 this year, is synonymous with great deals on gadgets, but you may not have to wait until the end of the month to get the goods you’re after. Jane Boyd Thomas, a professor of marketing at Winthrop University, says she’s noticed retailers are getting an early jump on technology deals. “We know that a lot of spending on Black Friday is self-giving, not gift-giving,” says Thomas. And with consumers still dealing with high prices in non-discretionary categories like food and fuel, retailers can entice shoppers to spend discretionary dollars with deals that come early and often. Look for markdowns on TVs, tablets, laptops, gaming systems, smartwatches and smartphones at all the usual places — Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, Target and Costco — between now and Black Friday. Need a thicker comforter for the cold months? January is just around the corner, and it’s your best bet for a deal on bedding and linens. Stores promote bedding discounts, called white sales, at the beginning of each year as a way to bring shoppers into their home departments. In past years, bedding basics were slashed by 50% or more at stores like JCPenney, Macy’s and Pottery Barn. We expect similar savings again in 2025. Aside from spring cleaning season, November might be the best time to add a new vacuum cleaner to your closet. We usually see vacuum models from Dyson, Shark, Bissell, Hoover and more on sale during Black Friday events. At NerdWallet, we tracked prices on a handful of products during major sale days. The iRobot Roomba i5 vacuum had a lower price on Black Friday 2023 than on Amazon’s Prime Day in July of this year. Expect sweeping sales on high-tech sweepers to land at the end of the month. This is unconventional, but to save money you may want to wait on apparel — especially items like shoes, hats, coats and gloves — says Thomas. “As we get closer to Christmas, I think the deals on those are going to be better and better,” she says. November, especially Black Friday, isn’t a bad time to buy clothes, but larger retailers that hold a lot of stock could be eager to offload unsold items as the gift-giving season gets closer. Stores like Gap, Anthropologie and Ann Taylor are likely to have more inventory than one-off boutique clothing stores, “so you have a better chance of getting what you want by playing the ‘wait game’ there,” says Thomas. Air fryers burst onto the scene around 2017, and the versatile cookers are still hot. Black Friday is a good time to go after these hot products, or you could score a deal on any given day in November. I found an Instant Vortex Plus air fryer for half off list price on Nov. 5 last year. The shiny stainless steel model caught my eye while at a friend’s house for dinner one evening. I checked Amazon when I got home and couldn’t pass up the $69.95 price. At the time of this writing, it retails for $139.95. I got a Black Friday price on a random Sunday in November. What else is hot in November? Coffee makers. Look for great deals on Nespresso, Keurig and other popular coffee maker brands in November, especially on Black Friday. On the other hand, you may want to roll the dice and wait for Cyber Monday — which falls on Dec. 2 this year — for other kitchen gadgets. We’ve seen items like the KitchenAid Classic Series stand mixer reach a lower price on Cyber Monday than on Black Friday at Amazon and Target. You know that meat and cheese board or tin filled with peppermint bark you send to family when you run out of time and gift ideas? According to Thomas’ advice, you can keep specialty treats as your backup plan. Retailers may not be motivated to move items quickly because seasonal treats tend to have a long shelf life and people often send them as last-minute gifts, she says. Veterans Day doesn’t pack the shopping punch of Black Friday. Still, here are some bonus ways to save a buck on Nov. 11. If you serve or have served in the military, ask about special discounts at stores, restaurants and even barbershops. For example, Rack Room Shoes will offer a 20% discount (normally 10%) to current and former U.S. military members and their dependents. Sport Clips is doing free haircuts for vets and active duty military at participating locations on Veterans Day. Whether you've served in the military or not, you can visit one of the U.S. National Parks that typically charges an entrance fee for free on Veterans Day. Mobile shopping and dynamic pricing (e.g., the random air fryer deal I found on Nov. 5) make it all too easy to spend on a whim. Go into November knowing what you want to buy and how much you’re willing to spend on a given item. If you know what you want, you can monitor and compare prices throughout the month, says Thomas. You can use a site like Slickdeals.net to set deal alerts for price drops all over the internet or use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel for alerts on products sold on Amazon. And if you buy something in November, but before Black Friday, you’ll want to check the retailer’s price-matching, price-protection and return policies first. For example, Amazon’s site specifically states that because the retailer strives to maintain competitive prices, it does not offer price matching. Be sure to dig into the details, too. Best Buy’s price match guarantee, for example, excludes items for sale Nov. 21 through Dec. 2 this year. Thomas’ advice: Let the store’s policy help you decide whether to take the deal now or risk it and wait for a better one on Black Friday. On a similar note...

Title: Nvidia to replace Intel in Dow Jones Industrial Average — Intel's 25-year reign has come to an end

Nvidia's AI leadership and Intel's bungling of its finances leads to this shakeup in the financial world. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia will replace Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, indicating the massive impact of the AI boom on the semiconductor and tech industries and the entire market. According to CNBC, this change will happen on November 8, about three months after news of Intel's financial woes broke out. The move was sparked by Intel's massive stock price drop—over 30% overnight—following the disastrous financial results released last August. The company has been bleeding cash through its data center and foundry divisions, resulting in a $1.6 billion loss for the second quarter of 2024. This was soon followed by news of massive layoffs, with over 15,000 employees affected. On the other hand, Nvidia’s stock price has been growing by leaps and bounds owing to the AI boom. For a short time, it has become the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. Even though the company has dropped down to second place next to Apple, it’s still a remarkable rise in such a short amount of time. Nvidia's share price was $14.16 in November 2022, rising by 218% to $45.01 a year later. Today, the company’s stock price is $135.37, another 201% jump over the past 12 months. This means that the company’s value jumped by over 850% in just two years. Intel entered the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1999, but its 25-year run was cut short by its failure to take the lead in artificial intelligence. On the other hand, Nvidia's replacement would be the fourth tech company worth over a trillion dollars to make it into the Dow, after Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. Interestingly, Amazon entered the list just this year after replacing the retail company Walgreens in February. A five-person committee, including editors from the Wall Street Journal, selects the companies to be included in the list. Although there are no specific rules for a company to be considered for the Dow, the committee members consider the following factors when determining which organizations will be added: large market capitalization, industry leadership, sustained financial growth, and investor interest. Nvidia’s entry into the list ticks all these boxes, showing the financial market’s positive outlook on the future of artificial intelligence.

Title: Many proclaimed remote work is here to stay. They couldn't be more wrong as big firms increasingly take a hardline stance

Big Read The timing of recent announcements by companies saying employees must return to the office reflects one possible factor for the trend: When one high-profile business leader makes an unpopular move first, it provides a cover of sorts for others to follow suit, experts say. (Illustration: CNA/ Nurjannah Suhaimi) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Grab’s sudden announcement on Oct 24 that it will be reversing its three-year hybrid work policy and requiring employees to return to office full-time may have caught some people off-guard. But for at least one employee, the writing had been on the wall for some time. The 30-something employee, who wanted to be known only as Ms Sam, said that since the middle of last year, the tech company started asking staff to return to the office more frequently – thrice a week instead of twice. Then, at the start of this year, Grab declared it would take “disciplinary action” against those who were non-compliant, she said. “I had a feeling (full return-to-office) would happen, especially with how Amazon and other tech companies are moving,” Ms Sam told CNA TODAY, referring to the American tech giant's announcement in September mandating working in the office five days a week. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in September that by being in office it was "easier to strengthen our culture" and collaboration is made "simpler and more effective". Mr Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, later said that the new policy had received broad support from workers. Amazon’s U-turn on remote and hybrid work – as well as its comply-or-leave ultimatum – was met with strong resistance: This week more than 500 of its employees wrote to Mr Garman urging a reversal of the decision. The letter described the management's explanation for the return-to-office mandate as “non-data-driven” and referred to Mr Garman’s own past comments, when he said the company was running effectively while fully remote. Other big-name employers globally have also taken a strong public stance on employees' physical attendance at the workplace, reversing the remote work trend that many had lauded as the new norm after the COVID-19 pandemic. Disney at the begining of 2023 mandated a return to office for four days a week. In April the same year, JP Morgan asked all its managing directors to return to office every weekday, and other employees thrice a week. In justifying the move, Disney CEO Bob Iger said nothing could replace the ability to connect and co-create when the team is physically together, while JP Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said remote work hinders "spontaneous idea generation". And before them, Elon Musk back in 2022 ordered Tesla and X (at the time still called Twitter) employees to clock in 40 hours in office a week or leave, saying that the creation of great products cannot happen with workers "phoning in". Most recently, it was reported this week that Starbucks recently announced a stricter enforcement of its three-days-in-office policy. From January, employees who do not comply risk losing their jobs. This slew of “back-to-office” mandates comes as a CEO Outlook 2024 Report by professional services firm KPMG published in September found that CEOs are hardening their stance on returning to pre-pandemic ways of working, with 83 per cent of business leaders globally expecting a full return to the office within the next three years. Ms Nicki Doble, principal adviser for corporate transformation, advisory, from professional KPMG in Singapore, said: “We have also seen many employers setting specific benchmarks for the number of days that employees are required to be in office.” This back-to-office fever seems to have reached Singapore’s shores, too, with companies recently asking their employees to work in the office more frequently, if not every day. Data from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) also shows a steady decline in the proportion of companies here offering a scheduled teleworking arrangement – from 56.5 per cent in 2021 to 31.9 per cent last year. Scheduled teleworking refers to an arrangement where employees are allowed to work remotely for an agreed period of time. Companies that do not offer scheduled teleworking arrangements could offer it on an ad-hoc basis or not at all, but no breakdown of such data is available. The number of job vacancies that offer remote work here has also declined, from 35 per cent in 2020 to 21 per cent in 2022, according to MOM's latest figures. All these developments come as recent research offers a mixed picture of how relatively productive work-from-home is compared with traditional working on-site, with some studies noting a tangible drop in productivity when employees work remotely full-time. And while many companies alluded to productivity as a factor when bringing their workers back to the office, human resource and labour experts told CNA TODAY that there may be other explanations for the trend. The timing of the recent spate of announcements points to one factor: When one high-profile company or business leader makes an unpopular move first, it provides a cover of sorts for others to follow suit. Labour economist from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) Walter Theseira said: “Nobody wants to be the first but when there is a wave of companies doing this actually, then that's when you see employers put into place what they wanted to do all along.” It seems contradictory when Singapore has been taking steps to encourage greater acceptance of flexible work arrangements, with the MOM introducing mandatory guidelines that will take effect in December. With work-from-home increasingly viewed by employers as an arrangement that has outlived its purpose, what will these recent developments mean for the future of other flexible work arrangements in Singapore? While a growing number of bosses are taking a tougher stance on employees being physically present in the office, many workers are still unconvinced about the need to do so. Multiple surveys indicate that the majority of workers around the world still prefer to work some days at home. For example, a poll by a US human resource solutions firm Bamboo HR, published in June, found that 42 per cent of American employees who returned to the office say they feel like they are showing up just for visibility. Similarly, a poll done by workplace design and planning firm Unispace found that being perceived as less committed to the job is the top concern about working remotely among employees in Singapore. As many as 36 per cent of employees here expressed this concern, higher than the 31 per cent global average. Meanwhile, a survey of workers and job seekers in Singapore done by human resource solution agency Randstad in late 2023 found that half the respondents said they would leave jobs that require them to work in office more frequently. And it seems that Singapore workers have stronger feelings about remote working compared with their global counterparts, according to a separate study in 2024 by human resource consultancy Mercer: Several employees who were reluctant to return to office full-time told CNA TODAY that they did not feel less productive when working from home. An employee at a multinational cybersecurity firm, who wanted to be known only by her initials TR, said that she and her colleagues feel they are able to do more work at home. “In the office, it's often noisier. People come by your desk to ask you questions, which is very distracting. It's troublesome having to look for available meeting rooms or phone booths, and you have to waste time commuting back and forth every day,” said Ms TR, who is in her 30s. Ever since her company strictly enforced a four-day work-from-office regime early last year, motivation among employees has dropped and some of her colleagues have even left, she added. While productivity and remote working may go hand in hand for employees like Ms TR, some research suggests otherwise. For instance, Forbes reported in August 2023 a 10 per cent to 20 per cent decrease in productivity for fully remote workers, citing a working paper by Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, whose findings were not peer-reviewed. Another paper by the University of Chicago in 2023, based on an analysis of 10,000 skilled professionals in a technology company, reported that productivity fell between 8 per cent and 19 per cent among remote workers. Locally, an analysis by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), published in its October 2023 macroeconomic review, found there was an increase in employees' output. This is as the workers saved time from not having to commute and channeled these savings to work. The analysis noted that there was not enough data to assess the productivity benefits of hybrid work arrangements, which may differ from pure remote work. And while hybrid working – which combines remote work with in-office work – has been touted as offering the best of both worlds, it also comes with its own set of challenges, according to professional networking platform LinkedIn. “Our latest survey reveals that over one-third of professionals in Singapore are struggling to communicate efficiently in hybrid work environments,” said Ms Feon Ang, managing director for LinkedIn APAC. In the meantime, co-working spaces have evolved their offerings as demand for office space increases. JustCo, for example, saw a 19 per cent increase in enquiries – from both individuals and companies – between January and October this year as compared with the same period in 2023. "While companies in Singapore are increasingly asking employees to return to office, there will likely still be an uptick in demand for flexible workspaces," said a spokesperson. Catering to this trend, the firm launched JustCo SuperPass in June last year, a cost-saving plan that allows companies to grant office access to additional employees on an ad-hoc basis without paying for long-term workstations. Meanwhile WeWork, which launched a similar pass in Singapore called WeWork On Demand back in 2021, has seen "significant growth" for it here recently – up 34 per cent year over year and 55 per cent year to date. "(The growth) underscores a clear shift: more workers are choosing high-quality office environments over home setups," said Mr Ryan Jans, its head of sales for the United Kingdom and Ireland, and Asia Pacific region. "This trend underscores a broader shift where more companies are recognizing the office as a strategic resource to elevate productivity, foster collaboration, and strengthen community.” The seemingly short-lived enthusiasm for remote working among employers comes at a notable juncture in Singapore, as the government is making strides to encourage flexible work arrangements amid perennial concerns about the nation’s tight labour market, ageing workforce and the fact that more workers are taking on caregiving roles at home. In April, MOM announced that all employers must have a process in place for workers to make formal requests for flexible work arrangements from December, when new tripartite guidelines come into effect. While employers have the right to reject such requests, the decision should be backed up by reasonable business grounds such as cost or productivity considerations, the ministry said. Given how many companies said during the pandemic that their remote working arrangements were not affecting productivity, the recent and sudden about-turn by a series of big employers raises one big question: Why now? From cost considerations to reducing headcount to promoting staff integration, these are some of the reasons cited by human resource and business experts as well as companies themselves for doing away with remote working in the past year or so: Both Amazon and Grab, in announcing their return-to-office mandates, said in-person collaboration, as observed during hybrid work arrangements, had been beneficial for the company. And so, to further enhance this, the companies decided to double down on the number of days in office. Group CEO of recruitment firm Reeracoen, Kenji Naito, noted: “For some roles, particularly where immediate responses are required or tasks aren’t easily measured, working from the office facilitates more streamlined communication.” Such interaction is even more important for small and young companies. Mr Bryan Tay, Singapore country manager for fintech platform Lendela, said: “We need to create a culture from scratch and cultivate trust, understanding, and a deep belief in our mission, which is much harder to do over a screen.” Lendela was founded in 2018 and currently has over 50 employees in Singapore and other markets. Since its founding, it has practised full-time work from the office, except during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Being together in the office allows us to build stronger connections, share ideas organically, engage in real-time problem-solving, and respond quickly to opportunities and challenges,” said Mr Tay. It is normal for companies to constantly review their policies and strategies from time to time, including those relating to employee location, said experts. Economist Song Seng Wun said that companies would have had hired workers during or soon after the pandemic. With the growing number of employees who have not had a chance to meet each other in person regularly, it may be an added impetus for some companies now to call them back into the office. “Workers come and go. Ultimately companies don’t want a situation where their employees are working with people they have never or hardly met,” said Mr Song, economic adviser for financial service provider CGS International. Mr Naito of Reeracoen added: “We've observed that junior employees with less experience and employees without clearly defined quantitative targets may face challenges working remotely. “Junior employees often require more direct supervision and mentorship, which can be limited in remote settings.” One often-heard argument for maintaining flexible working arrangements is that a company that fails to do so risks losing good employees. “However, some companies might see this as an opportunity to streamline their workforce, which could align with their goals of optimising headcount,” said Mr Lewis Garrad, partner and career business leader for Mercer Asia. Interestingly, some of the companies calling their workers back to office, such as Grab, Disney and Amazon, are also those that have recently made headlines for retrenchment exercises. Indeed, one of Amazon’s top executives reportedly told employees that if they had problems complying with the mandatory return to office policy, “there are other companies around”. Bamboo HR’s survey in June found that a quarter of vice-presidents and C-suite executives and 18 per cent of HR professionals surveyed in the US admitted hoping for “some voluntary turnover” when they implemented mandatory return-to-office policies. But experts also noted that a forced return to office policy may be too blunt a tool to trim headcount. Assoc Prof Theseira said some companies may see it as "not necessarily a bad thing" to lose employees who are unwilling to return to office and whom they perceive as less committed. "But there is this argument that they might be losing their best staff, because their best staff have the ability to quit and then find a job elsewhere," he said. Experts added that many other factors influence a company’s decision to mandate a return to office. While some argue that enforcing office-based work would drive away talent, Lendela told CNA TODAY that its retention rate this year so far is 88 per cent across all its offices, and 87.5 per cent for the Singapore office. By comparison, a poll by market research firm IPSOS in January found about three in 10 workers in Singapore intend to leave their employers within two years. A separate study by professional services firm EY in July 2023 found 45 per cent of workers here had plans to change jobs within a year. In Lendela's latest monthly employee satisfaction survey – done anonymously and online – its workers gave an average rating of 86 per cent in terms of happiness. Meanwhile over at another startup BigFundr, which also stopped practising remote work after the COVID-19 period, one employee, Mr Imran Johri, found work-from-office a refreshing change from the purely remote arrangement in his old company. “Those work-from-home years were the most challenging for me (in terms of productivity) as I have three young children who simply see my presence as the licence for constant engagement,” said Mr Imran, who is marketing director at BigFundr. Nonetheless, he admitted that a hybrid arrangement would be ideal, as it would allow him to meet his caregiving responsibilities for his children and family too. Some experts highlighted the high real estate costs here as an additional motivation for companies to bring their workers back to the office to “justify” their spending on rents. “The high cost of office space in Singapore means companies with large offices may feel the need to bring employees back to fully use their space,” said Mr Jianhan Qiu, principal for strategy, Asia, at Unispace Singapore. “The cost of keeping empty offices can push businesses to focus on in-office work, making it a financial decision as well as a cultural one.” While companies make their own calculations in setting any policy or strategy, it is also normal for them to take a look at what others in the industry are doing and take that into consideration. Ms Shalynn Ler, Singapore general manager for recruitment firm Ethos BeathChapman, noted that companies are operating under great economic uncertainty and face huge pressures from shareholders. “It is easy in such circumstances to be very reactive and herd mentality sets in, where companies start to mirror what other big firms and industry leaders are doing,” she said. Assoc Prof Theseira of SUSS said that it “seems true anecdotally” that if a certain big company does something, then a smaller one would tend to follow suit as well. It also applies to measures that are seen as unpopular but otherwise financially necessary – such as retrenching workers, raising prices of products, or even changing work practices. “The natural tendency of management globally is always to do it, because they are looking after the bottom line. But it's just that the company may not want to do this (yet), if they are going to be the first,” said Assoc Prof Theseira. Ms Ang from LinkedIn noted that businesses globally are “facing headwinds and rapid change”, prompting companies to reconsider a whole range of decisions, from investments to operations. Though the latest MOM figures indicate that although the labour market in Singapore is tight – the unemployment rate is low and there is a scarcity of workers to fill roles – sentiment has been bleak. Retrenchments more than doubled in 2023 from the year before. Earlier this year, the Singapore National Employers Federation and the labour movement said they were expecting more layoffs until the end of 2024. Furthermore, as more organisations adopt work-from-office as the default arrangement, even if there are more jobs available, employees seeking flexible options may have fewer choices, according to some experts. “This trend could potentially decrease the bargaining power of workers who prefer remote or hybrid models,” said Mr David Blasco, country director at Randstad Singapore. Simply put, companies which want to revoke work-from-home benefits may have to worry less about their employees leaving. Ms Sam from Grab said that her salary lags behind her peers, but the flexible work arrangement has “somewhat made up for it – or at least delayed my departure”. She intends to leave, but it may not be so straightforward now. “And I think the company knows this as well, the job market isn’t that great. So maybe many of us won’t be able to find better options anyway,” she said. As much as the launch of flexi-work guidelines by MOM seems a step in the right direction, experts pointed out that companies can quite easily reject employees' requests for these arrangements with simple and general justifications, such as by saying that they need all workers to work in the office full-time due to operational reasons. “There is an overarching concern that the framework's reliance on employer goodwill and competitive pressure, rather than strict enforcement, could limit its impact,” said Mr Blasco of Randstad. In response to queries after the guidelines were announced, MOM said that errant companies would be counselled and be given warnings if they do not consider their employees’ flexi-work requests fairly. Mr Blasco said what may be a bigger deterrent to companies considering a full turnabout from remote or hybrid work arrangements is the potential reputational cost. “Ultimately, the organisation's policies will significantly shape its culture and long-term reputation," he said. He added that given how any negative perception of a company can be “particularly stubborn to change”, it would benefit the companies to really think through their workplace policies before implementing them. Some companies currently operating in the office full-time, like the startup BigFundr, are well aware of this. “It is with that in mind that we are now looking into our version of a more flexible work arrangement,” said its founder and CEO Quah Kay Beng. He added that they are “keen to allow for (flexi-work) to be part of our work culture” as soon as the company of 14 employees grows in size and efficiency. Experts also generally agreed that even as some companies require their employees to return to office, it does not mean the end of flexible work arrangements. “The initial enthusiasm for 100 per cent remote work may evolve into more nuanced approaches to flexible work that are better suited to each company’s operational needs,” said Mr Naito of Reeracoen. Ms Ler of Ethos BeathChapman said in the long term, the future of flexi-work arrangements in Singapore would also be influenced by the norms of the bigger economic markets such as the United States, United Kingdom and China. “If it becomes more common in those bigger economies globally for employers to revert to offer-based work policy, for instance, Singapore will likely follow suit,” she added. Furthermore, if Singapore excels in flexible-work arrangements, it could serve as a competitive advantage for the nation. The experts noted that the MOM guidelines, though not legally binding, signals that the government recognises the importance of flexi-work arrangements. Thus, it is unlikely that such arrangements will disappear entirely in the future. And even if companies believe they can afford to scale back on certain flexible work arrangements now, they are likely to reevaluate their position once the job market cycle shifts and becomes more of an employee's market again, and they face challenges in attracting talent in the future, experts said. The economists also noted that the labour market is cyclical – it may favour employers for a period of time, but will return to being an employees' market when talents become scarce and companies have to compete with each other for headcount. “It wouldn't be surprising if at some point in the future, you have one market player doing this big, flashy (flexi-work) thing and say: 'We offer all this hybrid work and so on, as an attempt to recruit people’,” said Assoc Prof Theseira.

Title: Weekend reading: the Big Could Have Been Worse Budget

Full Content:
Feel free to skip one more pundit’s view of the Budget if you’ve had enough. I’m not claiming to be John Maynard Keynes. This is just how I see things. When asked why he robbed banks, the US heist wiz Willie Sutton said: “Because that’s where the money is.” Those hit by what passes for wealth taxes in Labour’s October Budget should sigh and say the same. Yes, capital gains taxes have gone up a little. But entrepreneurs and investors with money to spare outside of tax shelters – or the gumption to start a business – don’t do it for a few percentage points of tax arbitrage versus income tax. We do it because the £760,000 you’re left with after a now-24% levy on every £1m you make in gains is still life-changing, compared to the average UK salary of £36,000 a year. No, you soon won’t be able to pass along a multi-million pension pot to the next-generation tax-free. But the state doesn’t provide tax reliefs for pension savings so that your kids need never work again. It does so to encourage you to save for a time when you can’t or won’t yourself. Scrapping the Lifetime Allowance for pensions doomed the IHT ruse, and the trade-off is a sensible one. Higher stamp duty when you buy a second-home or investment property? Well I don’t like transaction taxes on principle. But if we’re going to have them, then at least this targets the pointy-end of the property market. Reversing the 20-year advance that landlords made versus first-time buyers continues. With house price to income ratios still off the charts and buying in the South impoverishing-to-impossible for most young people without a suitcase of cash from mum and dad, I’m at peace with that direction of travel, too. Real wage growth in the UK has been flat since the early 2000s. Near-zero interest rates for more than a decade after the financial crisis only inflated the wealth of those with assets – even as the bottom half that relied on lowly wages or state benefits saw their standard of living go nowhere, before the post-Covid inflation shock squeezed them for what was left. If you’re really upset by Rachel Reeves’ Budget then you’ve probably either done very well – relatively-speaking – for the past 15-20 years or else you’ve been in denial about the state the UK is in. Count your blessings. I’m fully aware that Monevator has wealthy readers and we’re generally pro-capitalism and getting ahead around here. So this isn’t a sermon that’s likely to have our parishioners throwing their hats into the air. But a reckoning was overdue and here it is. We need to manage the UK as the middle-ranking mostly pretty poor country (judged per capita) that it now is. Not pander further to the fantasies of post-2016 populism. Some friends of mine bemoan a return of ‘the politics of envy’. But I just see a return to the politics of reality. This was not a perfect Budget. Not even judged by my standards, which is akin to judging how well an ambulance crew performs when it arrives to find the patient already blue on the floor and gasping. The biggest tax-raising measure – the hike in employer’s national insurance – can only hurt growth in itself, even if spending money had to be raised somewhere to stave off worse. At the margin it will make the young and low-skilled less employable. Hospitality and retail will suffer. And personally I wouldn’t be taxing jobs harder with a potential AI revolution at the door. But income needed to be found. This country couldn’t take another round of austerity, even if it had voted for it – which it didn’t do in voting for Labour, or for Johnson years beforehand. To get itself past an electorate either unwilling or unable to face facts, Labour had sadly boxed itself in with red lines around the other big revenue raisers. So here we are. Even with the tax hikes, Reeves’ additional borrowing has slightly rattled the gilt market – although I judge much of the fairly modest rise in bond yields we’ve seen is ongoing recession risk being taken off the table in the US, with knock-ons around the world. I see the Budget as only adding a kicker. So it’s far from another Disastrous Mini-Budget. However it is a bit of Show Me The Money concern. Everyone sensible knows the UK needs growth. The State needs it, and we need it in our pay packets. Neither I nor the OBR thinks this Budget will do much for growth over the long-term. The latter forecasts a little boost upfront and then if anything a gentle decline in the long-term. That’s not good enough. But again, what’s the alternative? The UK electorate voted to make itself poorer in 2016, rightly or wrongly. That bill – plus the same for preventing a potential depression during Covid – has come due. Decisions have consequences. Even if you don’t agree with Goldman Sachs, the OBR, and other mainstream economists that leaving the EU is indeed on its way to costing us the 4-5% hit to GDP that was predicted and is playing out, not even the lunatic fringe can divine any Brexit dividend. Ironically the only reason things aren’t worse economically is because immigration has gone through the roof. Going it alone could only have boosted the UK’s economic prospects with the deregulated ultra-capitalist ‘Singapore on Thames’ model. Boris Johnson rejected that years before Reeves took charge. So we’re back to tax and spend – except it’s as much to keep the lights on as to invest in infrastructure. Still, that’s better than austerity at this moment in time. Labour’s political opponents have understandably focused on taxes going up after Labour’s election pledges in spirit implied no such thing. Fine, but firstly their manifesto didn’t add up either. Both sides have seen this country prove for a decade that it will only vote en masse for pretty lies. Secondly, what would the Budget haters do differently? Cut services further? Everyone can see they’re falling apart. Cut taxes to stimulate growth? We couldn’t even afford the last unfunded bung. Fudge the books by not being frank about spending commitments and promising investment and ‘levelling up’ that was just rhetoric plastered on top of a crumbling national fabric? Oh yeah, we tried that. I say be careful what you wish for. As for our own wallets, well I can still put £80,000 a year into tax shelters – via ISAs and pensions – and I can invest my way to a comfortable retirement without some silly lifetime cap on my gains. The tax-free lump sum was left intact too. None of the nightmare scenarios came true. Not even flat-rate tax relief. If you’re a high-earner you can easily make yourself a multi-millionaire helped by those reliefs, without starting so much as a lemonade stand in terms of real risk-taking. Can any of us – hand on heart – say that isn’t still plenty of room to do well for ourselves? There was even the rabbit in a hat of the freeze on income tax thresholds being lifted in 2028. A half-boiled bunny for sure, but if I was Reeves I’d have extended them further and not hiked employer’s NI. As for being clobbered by the supposedly crushing fist of the leftwing unleashed, according to the Budget calculators I’m about £1.36 a year worse off from Reeves’ measures. So let’s have some perspective. The actual ultra-left – Jeremy Corbyn and his fellow travellers – have penned an open letter condemning this Budget as ‘austerity by another name’. Reeves has not solved anything with her Budget but it shouldn’t make things worse. Given the rubbish place we’re starting from, that’s no mean achievement. With luck she’s bought time for a few good years and a fortunate break or two to get the UK economy going again. That might give us a bit more room to be bolder. We’re overdue a bounce. But I know many of you will disagree, one way or another. Before we kick things about in the comments, let’s remember Labour hasn’t been in charge for 14 years. Let’s not pretend the UK was humming along before somebody let the long-haired students in to seize the levers of state. And if Liz Truss is reading, I got some stick for not totally sticking it to your Budget, because you did sort of address the elephant in the room – the lack of economic growth. Unfortunately that message was wrapped in a package as convincing as a man with a billboard crying the end of the world is nigh. Which ultimately only made the markets and the electorate less tolerant of radical action. No, Britain signed up for gentle decline years ago. The spirt of the 52% is like an old person blustering around a care home talking about the good old days and complaining he can’t understand the nurses’ accents. Now Barry Blimp is moaning that he has to take his medicine. I’m shocked. Sorry, but the grown-ups are back in charge. They’re doing what they can, but that’s only so much. As for the alternative, I’d love to hear a well-argued and costed counter-narrative spelling out a lower tax, higher growth future with a respectable welfare state left intact – as judged by the electorate, not the rich flying by to their private stand-ins. And that’s certainly not coming from the Tory leaders in waiting. So tax, spend, and muddling on it is. Have a great weekend!

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Completely agree with your comments and sentiments on the budget. For most of us much ado about nothing, and partially at least corrected some imbalances. As you say I’ve not come across a viable alternative that somehow magically combines lower taxes with better services and growth. I wish it existed. Mostly concur with your budget analysis, especially around IHT and pensions. I disagree with hitting lower earners disproportionately via employers indirectly though. I think that will serve to ensure the poor stay poor. The elephant in the room I think is still NHS spending and continuing the bonfire. I also cynically thought that Reeve’s offer to unfreeze income tax bands inflation linking in another 4 years was quite a rather large slap around the face with a wet fish for everyone – obviously (a) just in time for the next election (b) 4 years of back peddling still available (why even bother promising it??) (c) everyone gets to keep bending over in the meantime. The beatings will continue until morale improves, eh? Either that or she doesn’t seriously expect to still be in #11 by then. Thanks for the links which are excellent as always and you’ve certainly had your work cut out this week! The idea that Labour has no real choice in delivering such a high taxing and high spending budget due to Brexit is for the birds. Wage growth was low well before 2016, the misallocation of capital due to artificially low rates has also costed the economy, including misallocation of spending by previous governments. Look at public sector productivity ? Look at high energy costs ? The ££ spent on recent renewables subsidies i.e. AR6 and the exorbitant costs to keep gas fired plants on standby? Increases costs throughout the economy. Plenty of leavers to pull without going back over the Brexit ground, yes of course it’ll disrupt trade – withdrawing after 40+ years of closer economic integration will do that – but there are many things within UK control that successive governments have chosen not to do. Mostly agreed that this budget was not much about real change and that is mainly down to there being little wriggle room, given years of the rulers leaving the nation’s wealth in the pawn shop. Financial bleeding from both feet between the brexit and covid corruption self-sanctions doubled down on the losses, so the country is not bankrupt suddenly, there was a long period of gradually before that. So as you conclude (no doubt unpalatable for the empire-loving generation) the UK is at best a struggling middle-ranking country now and the next responses will determine which way it goes. Sadly, on that note, massively expensive legacy nuclear capacity was justified as a deterrent to being attacked, which a non-belligerent country could use to just pay for a defence force from then on. But as the ‘~£3 billion per year for as long as it takes’ allocation shows, even as the taxpayers have to tighten their belts, forever wars with no relevance or benefit to us are the priority. (No referendum on that though) The NI thing was cleverly implemented in my opinion, by increasing the rebate for hiring staff. My business which hires 2 staff on decent salaries + 2 directors on minimum wage will actually be a few thousand better off than before, though after 5 staff total it heads in the other direction. Not a bad trade off in my opinion (and manages to catch the “single employee” corporations too, which is fair). Mostly I’m relieved they didn’t touch pension tax handling, and stunned they didn’t slash ISA allowances. If I were chancellor (and less self interested) those would have been on the block… Excellent work,, Thank you!! Genius quotes “We need to manage the UK as the middle-ranking mostly pretty poor country (judged per capita) that it now is.” and “Both sides have seen this country prove for a decade that it will only vote en masse for pretty lies.”. Great analysis and agree most of those seeking FIRE should be mighty relieved that the Budget wasn’t much worse, given the huge sum Reeves needed to raise to cover the economic mismangement of the last lot. She has sensibly stated there will not be another Budget until next Autumn so we can breathe easy for another 12 months. Noteworthy that most of those complaining are at the very top of the wealth distribution which I suspect is exactly what was intended. @jds247. Agree the NI changes were cleverly implemented – also in a small business and our NI bill will fall due to the huge rise in Employment Allowance. So in some ways the new system is now more progressive. The problem is the mounting/runaway debt crisis which no one talks about The populace is still not ready for the required adjustments to correct this situation so politicians keep kicking the financial debt ball down the road Are we ready for Argentina type actions which seem to be working in that country admittedly from a much worse starting point? It would be sad if it actually has to be a financial crash that brings people via their politicians to a sense of financial reality-ie you can only keep spending more than you earn for a finite length of time before your debts become overwhelming xxd09 I can’t say I’m enthusiastic about paying increased rates of CGT on a nominal gain on disposing of an asset that’s worth less now in real terms than when I bought it. Surely if there was a tax that needed to be reformed and could actually help to generate revenue, it would have been a review of council tax. Lower priced bands could have been left frozen or areas deemed deprived or where house prices have not risen at a level relative to the South East could have seen a fall, while more expensive bands seen a lift. This could then be used directly for local services and fund city/regional mayors and also show that more resources are being raised locally and spent locally. I agree the IHT on pensions thing is justifiable, but it still hurts! I have formulated a work around though which also solves the CGT problem and will start to enact it this year. Love the recommendation for ‘Confederacy of Dunces’ – it’s a great book that is long overdue a re-read! Might want to check the spelling of the link though @TI (A general comment rather than this article specifically) It’s easy to say “the UK is in decline, I want to move” – and plenty of people have been in recent months, indeed since Brexit. But where to move to – is there anywhere better? Obviously this depends on personal factors too. But I’d love to see some pieces going into this more, discussing specific places, if you don’t consider too far outside this site’s scope! I largely agree, although insisting that the national insurance increase be paid by GP practices and care homes and the like is a big mistake. I’d anticipate a U-turn if this were the Tories of recent times. Not sure if this government are inclined to react to public outcry in that way though. I think you know I don’t agree with all of your comments, I’ll add that as a rider rather than rehash the almost decade long argument here. However, there is a contradiction in what you write above, both Brexit was bound to make us poorer and also Boris Johnson ruled out a Singapore on the Thames free trading nation – that is the beauty of our parliamentary system and the movement of time – anything Boris wanted or didn’t want can be changed. This budget wasn’t ‘grand’ which a lot of people were expecting from a first budget. But between the budget and the signalling between the election and now I think it’s signalled some significant direction changes, which will mean the economy will be different in five years as these incrementally ratchet up. Some of them will be positive – and some of them will lead to more growth. Ie, almost totally missed, but the minimum wage has risen by 6pc and working age benefits by 1.4pc. Do that three times in a row and the incentives to work, with all the positive mental and physical (there is after all one ‘health’) benefits attached. There is likely to be less immigration as the notion ‘English people won’t do those jobs’ becomes ‘Oh, English people wouldn’t do those jobs for an extra £10 a month but for an extra £500 over benefits now we’re talking’ That’s important because gdp per capita needs to rise, and ending the farce of paying benefits to deliveroo riders from abroad and benefits to English people for not working is an obvious way the country can get richer Also, the war on BtL continues apace. It’s been years, and years, but I’m 42 and have friends that earn well, finally now the talk is about ISAs and pensions and tbh BTL isn’t what it was. That means investment in the real economy AND first time buyers being able to achieve dream of home ownership – as immigration falls with more Brits working hopefully that’ll improve things All in all, there are levers to pull – and this may have been the firing shot in pulling them – incrementally. I’d prefer Nigel to be in charge but I think it was an ok budget for growth Growth only comes by getting Brits into work. I did nothing and I’m not that unhappy. CGT will hit me but I’m not crying. But what was amusing was the Daily Mail publishing two or three articles a day in the run up with panicking suggestions to take pensions now and get the maximum commutation before the evil Chancellor reduced it. The day after the DM headlines were that people who did this were tricked by the same evil Chancellor who caused the panic Also – I only learnt this this week – the stamp duty surcharge is on second homes or additional homes. So if you have a second home, sell your own home and buy another home (to live in) it’s not due. Anyone who saves many thousands of pounds via this knowledge please let me know I’ll send you my number to venmo me. And a quick last one about the 80k (81k if using a LISA?)… …on this the signalling was stupid. I exceeded my annual allowance in 22/23 but was saved by both (or more accurately either) of the previous two years. Since then the allowance has jumped up 20k and have some additional cash. I am currently not contributing this to my pension because I worry they may change the annual allowance in the future and I’ll need the excess this year to avoid a charge. Or they’ll introduce a lifetime allowance. Or they’ll raise the age I can get at it (whilst 58 isn’t old by any means I mean if they tinker and put it to 70)… …must be millions people up and down the country not investing in pensions because of their stupidity in signalling changes Good points and analysis, as usual @TI! @TA: thanks for the amazing post on how to buy inflation linked gilts. With 2-year yields going up on Thursday and the market expecting higher inflation next year after the budget on Wednesday, I got myself a bit of a bargain on Thursday! Cheers 😉 @all — Thanks for the comments. Going to let the conversation breath. Will just expand below a bit on Brexit as I really didn’t want to bog my intro down with it again. I understand we’re all fed up with it, even if that doesn’t wish it away! 🙂 @SurreyLad — Yes I agree Brexit isn’t the whole cause of the state we’re in. I didn’t say it was. I said our malaise began since the early 2000s. Brexit was a folly that the country couldn’t afford. The US might be able to afford Trumpian tariffs, say. But we needed everything to go right to squeeze as much as we could from our dehydrating lemon. An analogy might be Germany, which could afford some more leftwing policies and so on (and trains that ran on time! 😉 ) until Russia invaded Ukraine. Europe can’t afford to be silly anymore, the world is too ruthlessly competitive and the low-hanging fruit was long ago picked. The US has transitioned to the new era, thanks partly to its hyper-scaling tech platforms that arguably its culture supported the creation of. (The old culture, not current culture-wars culture). We haven’t got that luxury. (Well the French and Italians have Luxury brands, but we have… struggling Burberry and Mike Ashley!) If you believe, as I do, that Brexit has probably cost us about 5% of GDP (not least taking into account what we might have done if we’d focussed on other stuff, as well as all the frictions etc) then that’s £35-40bn of lost tax revenues I’m afraid. Do I think that’s *exactly why* Reeves just raised taxes by £40bn? No, but it’s certainly suggestive and in the mix. Unfortunately I can’t see me not mentioning Brexit for at least the next decade. I know it’s frustrating and boring, but my stance has always been that it’s a slow bleed/headwind, and the nature of that is, as I said from 2016, that the costs will compound. One thing we all know about around here is that compounding adds up mightily over time. 😐 Also – if Trump wins and Elon gets his way, the govt in the states may employ roughly a third less employees than it does now ( Twitter is down 65pc). If that happens, should be a lot of people in non jobs in ‘our’ NHS finally get the boot. Along with local councils etc. let’s not pretend everyone in the NHS works in ambulances or A&E – replace a few fax machines and receptionists for modern technology, remove all the diversity coordinators and likely have a better service for less money. Get Brits back to work, drill baby drill, and slash the cost of the nhs. @Southbank #13 But where to move to – is there anywhere better? Obviously this depends on personal factors too. But I’d love to see some pieces going into this more, discussing specific places, if you don’t consider too far outside this site’s scope! This is much easier when you are younger. Obvs because you have the dynamism and flexibility of youth, and you have a less complicated life, as Mark Zuckerberg observed in his “Young people are just smarter” quote. But no man is an island. Your human relationships matter, just not in a financial sense. I think there are plenty of sites on geo-arbitrage and digital nomadism, and on strictly financial criteria this can work very well. I’ve forgotten who it was on here who observed in the comments what is the point of achieving financial independence if you have to move away from family and friends to do it? There’s a tremendous variation in the value of these non-financial connections to different people. But I agree with his sentiment. Finance is but one aspect of living a good life, and it would be a shame to win that particular battle and lose the living a good life war. It is far less amenable to generalisation because it’s very multivariate. And no, AI isn’t going to give you the answer, TBH anyone who trusts anything AI tells them deserves all they get! Sadly this is one conundrum you have to compute yourself, on manual, and with input from any significant other people in your life. My sense is that this/our community is rather relieved it’s dodged a bullet…for now. So sleep is easier for now. Managed decline of the UK has been deemed simply too unpalatable to be told to the electorate since WW2. How many times do we hear “sixth richest country/economy ” and so on. Never the more honest “25th richest country per capita using purchasing parity and falling”. And it’s not because that’s a complete mouthful. So for that reason I’m not particularly optimistic that there will not be Willie Sutton style raids on where the money is. Especially when expectation gap of for example the UK health service and what the UK can actually afford is huge. Pure entitlement IMO. In the end healthcare will be rationed in some shape or form because we can’t afford 1st class healthcare and all the other 1st class public spending wishes. It means levelling down in most respects then it will only be a matter of time before they follow the money that’s left to find ..any money. Sounds depressing really. Levelling down because large tax rises with no/slow growth is levelling down pure and simple. So it wouldn’t surprise me if taxes on eg all housing equity principal residence or not, removal of tax free this and tax free that are part of the inevitable tax collection mission creep. After all the excuse “what choice did we have” seems to have passed without much protest and you’ll be hearing that a lot more often I suspect. On a brighter note I have also made my rolling index link gilt ladder. @Naeclue (#11) – If you don’t mind sharing the details of your plan, I would be very interested on reading about your ideas. Perhaps I could try something similar 🙂 I do expect my children to do well without any inheritance windfall from us. Just as I have done well myself without ever receiving any inheritance. I have even told my parents, I expect them to please just carry on living indefinitely and that I do not want to receive any inheritance from them. On the other hand, if I can help my children a bit more without them expecting it and counting on it, I think it can only be a good thing. @TI – sensible analysis I think and thanks for the links, I enjoyed Ian Dunt’s take on it. After all the press hype it seems like quite a balanced approach to me. @Southbank, Ermine – I did exactly this when I was a new grad in the post 89 recession. Of my class about half went to Hong Kong and most of the rest including me went to Germany. It was of course easy to do, all the Single Market privileges in my case, full professional recognition etc. It was just a matter of packing a rucksack, a bit of language training and having about £1k in ready cash. I ended up getting a job within a week. Now at the other end of my working life I’m actively looking into moving elsewhere but its a much more weighty decision to take when you have even modest assets ie house, pension ISAs etc. Still, I’m looking forward to a ‘research’ trip in Spring.. @BBlimp #15 but I’m 42 and have friends that earn well, finally now the talk is about ISAs and pensions @BBlimp #18 Or they’ll raise the age I can get at it (whilst 58 isn’t old by any means Aging 16 years in one day is a tough gig This budget is a significant rise in public sector spending. About 4% in real terms. That will put UK public sector spending in the mid 40s as a % of GDP. Right in the middle of the pack compared to our European peers. If this doesn’t deliver good public services – and I very much doubt it will – then there can be no further excuses from the left that we are underspending. Perhaps, we can finally switch to understanding why the public sector has such incredibly poor productivity. At a personal level, the budget was mildly negative. I have very little outside tax wrapper that is vulnerable to CGT. I have a few houses but as a percentage of net worth it’s <5%. Making pensions subject to IHT is also not a biggie. I plan to transfer 80% of net wealth to my kids in their 20s. The remainder we may/may not spend depending on how asset returns pan out. We'll re-sequence to optimize IHT but if it gets caught, it gets caught. If we somehow live to 100, my children wouldn’t get that inheritance till they were 60. Bit pointless getting it that late. If you wanted to reverse per capita income on PPP falling you could 1. Expand LHR, Gatwick, London City 2. Drill for shale 3. Allow housebuilding even when it interferes with habits of newts 4. allow the London sphere and don’t worry about ‘light pollution’ 5. Examine why HS2 cost so much more than it would have in France, let alone Shenzen. If we want to be travelling on the Elizabeth line rather than the northern line, we need to go through the issues with planning and growth, unpick them; and get building. Sadly, the Tories and Labour are two sides of the manage decline coin. But things aren’t as bad yet as they were in the 70s, trust me when they are, someone will come in and do all the above. It’ll be a shock to all of you that don’t realise we chose managed decline with every silly growth defeating measure we employ @Tom-Baker Dr Who >I do expect my children to do well without any inheritance windfall from us. Just as I have done well myself without ever receiving any inheritance. I don’t think this is necessarily a good comparison. Compare and contrast the amount of money your peers inherited with the potential inheritance of your child’s peers. @BBlimp — Given you’ve been wrong about pretty much everything for the best part of that decade that we’ve been debating — quite literally, from the outcome of Brexit to the kind of Brexit we’d get to Liz Truss — then perhaps you might first put your hands up for the damage your decisions have already caused to the UK and say “I got it wrong” before lecturing us that “It’ll be a shock to all of you”. Basically we’re indulging you here. Wake up man! 🙂 Was happily drawing my retirement income from tax free ISAs and keeping under the IHT limits but the IHT pension changes in the budget mean a sudden potential £200000 IHT bill So…….will continue with the ISA (no tax) withdrawals but will be running down my ISA totals to a lower level than originally planned Spending money just to save tax is always at the back of my mind as a not a sensible policy but…….. Potentially must get rid of £200000 over the next few years over and above current income requirements-now aged 78-time is running out! Any suggestions? Gifts,buy new cars,up grade those holiday hotels,charities etc etc xxd09 @remoaner – is that a joke? I’m 42 NOW, currently I can get he pension in 16 years, and I’m worried that during those 16 years the rules might change. You seem simple. @TI – would you like to comment on the growth suggestions or just continue ad hominem. What exactly is unlikely to be pro growth about expanding the airports for eg? @xxd – live another 4.5 years ? @xxd09 – ‘all of the above’ I would say! I’m imagining you as some sort of Brewster’s millions remake.. great problem to have. You could have a lot of fun. Just want give @BBlimp some support here. You are not alone. I really like your writing and insights. I’m new to having money and came across your site in an effort to educate myself. I also agree with your viewpoint in this article. @bblimp — is not ad hominem in this context. You said Brexit was the bright new economic future and derided remoaners etc. Brexit has at the least achieved nothing and all sensible economists agree there’s been a substantial cost. I said it’d slow growth and hit us all. It has. See the budget. Thanks for the Brexit share of the tax hikes to achieve nothing. I’m not going to debate your daring proposals to expand loads of airports and pretend climate change isn’t happening. It’s the same facile Blimpian rubbish that brought us Brexit. The world is complicated. I’ve wasted far too much time over the years arguing with you guys that yeah, the world is not flat. Policing this thread to keep comments on the Budget topic from here. Cheers. If we are c. 4% of GDP worse off as a result of Brexit (btw what does that mean in real money?) does that mean that if we’d remained in the EU our economic performance would have been up there with the US and China? And would have bitten all other EU countries into the dust (since we aren’t that far off now)? And you really believe that?!? Also btw, I am already seeing businesses planning to pass on cost increases as a result of the budget that exceed those implemented during the post COVID /Ukraine/Suez period. @David — You write: If we are c. 4% of GDP worse off as a result of Brexit (btw what does that mean in real money?) does that mean that if we’d remained in the EU our economic performance would have been up there with the US and China? And would have bitten all other EU countries into the dust (since we aren’t that far off now)? And you really believe that?!? No, I didn’t say that. It is tiresome to have to repeat the same thing over and over again. At least as much as to hear me mention Brexit every three months I’m sure. 😉 I believe that we’re 4-5% smaller in GDP terms. Nothing more, nothing less. That’s about £100bn in real money or about £35-40bn in lost tax receipts to the state. As I said in the article. Which is about the size of Reeves’ tax hikes. Or maybe we could have unfrozen income tax thresholds a few years ago. Or done a bunch of other useful stuff with the foregone money. Brexit was lost on the reality that economies are complex and fiddly things. Commentary since has proven people still don’t get it even after we’ve seen no dividends, sunlit uplands, booms, resurgent manufacturing, whatever. We have made our trade terms a bit worse. We’ve reduced skilled migration of the most amendable sort. Companies have reduced (not stopped) investing here to access Europe. These things all add up. As I linked to the other week and haven’t time right now to do again, the UK grew faster than other EU countries over the time we were in the EU. I can see it’s confusing if someone ignored this reality and believed lies to the contrary pre-vote. But that’s the reality. We ‘should’ be growing faster than the EU. We should be a richer country than we are now. The flipside of that isn’t a Mad Max wasteland, it’s a slightly less dynamic economy and a more cash-strapped state. As I’ve written many times, you feel a recession when GDP goes negative to the tune of 1-2%. So 4-5% is meaningful. We haven’t gone negative in the sense that these are ‘opportunity cost’ losses, but we’re feeling it in our relative standing and our ability to live as we did (public services etc). But again, this isn’t the whole story, agreed. Covid, 0% interest rates and malinvestment, truly terrible political leadership for a few years — it’s all in the mix. I suggest doing some reading about Dave Brailsford’s ‘marginal gains’. That’s the way modern economies work, outside of war and pandemics. Sure standing on a box and blustering about bright futures and animal spirits etc can be helpful, but only if it’s accompanied by an underlying reality. So Thatcherism, say, had a lot of rhetoric but it was backed up by (messy) deregulation. I’m sure in that case the political posturing helped it along. Economically speaking, Brexit was posturing on the back of a negative development. No dice. Again, let’s leave Brexit here or it will crowd out the conversation about the Budget. Felt I had to reply to this apparently well-meaning comment but will be more likely to delete from here for the sake of the Budget conversation. Cheers. I’m a simple minded miner, I part read the book “die with zero” and I seem to remember when it was mentioned when would your kids need help best with finances when they are older and probably settled?40+ and maybe struggled to get there themselves or maybe get something earlier on in life when setting out; I didn’t think too much of it at the time when reading. After this budget I actually now think hmm maybe the author was on to something and a small pile now before any iht and any possible meddling with pensions and tax free limits on savings may be in order. I think I’ll dig the book out and read the whole of it this time, maybe there is something to learn from a multi multi millionaire after all compared to my modest life savings which I’ve saved after tax and to the rules of the game. @xxd @miner Would your kids preferred you spent £200k or they got 200k? Would your kids prefer you spent £200k or they get £120k? As someone who simply cannot spend £4 for a cup of tea in pret and likely will never be able to whatever situation I’m in, i understand why you struggle to spend. So maybe you could take them on holiday ? Do up their homes now ? I know part of the holidays may constitute a gift but your parts wouldn’t be ! I wish my parents would spend their money. We’ve gone from full-fat cakeism to diet cakeism. But cakeism it still is. A year or two of real-term increases in public expenditure is not going to fix over a decade of chronic underinvestment. Maybe the roof will stop leaking for a bit. @The Investor. I know you don’t want to talk about THAT “B” word as it detracts from THIS “B” word, but I’d feel like the knockee in a game of Knock Down Ginger if I can’t respond on just one point: “I believe that we’re 4-5% smaller in GDP terms.” Is that each and every year, or a one-off hit? @David — Fair enough (but other commenters let’s please leave it here, I already fear the Budget conversation has been derailed given how the comments have trailed off 🙁 ). To answer your question via a neutral third-party, here’s how the latest version of ChatGPT puts it: The consensus across models and studies suggests that Brexit will likely reduce UK GDP by 4-5% over the long term compared to if the UK had remained in the EU. This translates to an estimated loss of tens of billions of pounds annually in economic output. The effects stem largely from reduced trade and investment, supply chain disruptions, and productivity impacts. [Various reports on the GDP gap emerging deleted for brevity] The estimated 4-5% GDP reduction from Brexit is not a year-over-year loss but rather a permanent reduction in the level of GDP compared to where it would have been if the UK had remained in the EU. This means that the UK economy is expected to be 4-5% smaller on an ongoing basis than it would have been without Brexit, affecting growth in a cumulative way over time. In Practical Terms If the pre-Brexit UK economy was projected to reach £2.5 trillion by a certain year, a 4-5% permanent reduction means it might instead reach around £2.375 trillion. Future growth compounds on this lower base, creating a long-term economic gap compared to a “remain” scenario. The OBR for one has been documenting this ongoing process and goes into quite a lot of detail, which you can read then believe or disbelieve as you see fit. 🙂 One part that makes no sense in the budget, as the Sky article right points out, is the fuel duty freeze. That would have been an easy lever to pull, with no pre-election commitments affected and much headroom to be gained. I’m hoping the renewable generation fees will at least move from electricity to gas in energy bills after the electricity pricing review is completed… > To answer your question via a neutral third-party, here’s how the latest version of ChatGPT puts it: Come again? “A known inveterate liar with a penchant for making stuff up quoth thusly” doesn’t advance the sum of knowledge one jot. Perplexity.ai brazenly assured me that the answer to what was the novel in the 1970s that had a young fellow field recording in Paris with a Nagra tape recorder is Gunther Grass’s The Tin Drum. A search of the novel for Nagra came up with a null result. Don’t believe anything that AI tells you. It makes Boris Johnson look like a bastion of truth-telling. The book was probably Odier’s Diva from 1979 I honestly wondered where TI got the 5pc lower gdp figure from – chatgtp. Blimey it’s beyond parody. Completely tragic. Explains so much. So, so, much. TI is presumably queuing up to believe covid came from bat markets, Russia caused Brexit, goodness knows what else !!! Thanks goodness Elon bought Twitter. @TI, yes, another pundit’s view from you on the budget but one I’ve been looking forward to seeing, along with the perspectives of Monevator readers. Thank you also for all the interesting links this week – and every week. The budget again underscored how challenging it is to find the best path forward for us in the UK, and how many diverse and opposing views there are. I think the impact of the budget is different for everyone, depending on one’s worldview, and, from an investment perspective, one’s personal circumstances. I have for example never had any gains subject to CGT – all our investments are in ISAs and SIPPs. However, the move to include pensions within IHT from April 2027 is something I need to consider. I understand the rationale behind the IHT changes, and the contrasting moral views there are on IHT. While I appreciate our fortunate position, I still have an obligation to minimise the tax we pay. We had planned for whatever remained of our pensions on our deaths to be passed to our children, and several charities. Over the years this has been in our calculations and always in the back of my mind. It’s at least partly why I keep on doing ‘one more year’. Our assets fall into three categories from an IHT perspective: the family home, ISAs and personal effects, and pensions. Perhaps I’ve invested too much in pensions over the years. You and Finumus have written about being careful not to indiscriminately pour all your savings into pension contributions, but for me that 40% tax relief was just too tempting! Another factor for us, as it has been for @xxd09 and others, is that we’ve never felt the need to have too much house – again leading to us making more pension contributions. As it currently stands, the house plus ISAs and personal effects would not result in an IHT liability. However, come April 2027, if we combine all three categories, our estate will be liable for IHT. I’m considering gifting the family home to the children earlier rather than upon death. I’m contemplating @ZX’s (#27) thoughts on the value of providing more financial assistance to the children at a younger age. There’s a lot to consider in the calculations – gifting the family home and then paying a market-related rental until we move in a year or two, inflating the children’s income during this period, checking if there is indeed no stamp duty on gifting because there’s no remaining mortgage, the risk of not surviving the seven years, etc. And, of course, there’s always the possibility that the change doesn’t come into effect in April 2027, or that other changes are made before that date that reduce our options. @ermine — Well I’ve tried explaining it myself and I’ve tried linking to the OBR, Goldman, others, and that didn’t work, so I thought this might be fun. Obviously I vetted the ChatGPT answer before posting — and obviously I posted knowing I was setting myself up for some ribbing. 😉 I would get over this AI FUD thing you have going on personally. 🙂 It’s great for general overview stuff, particularly if you know a subject OR you’re not too bothered about every fact being right. In the first case you can spot problems, in the second case the errors don’t really matter if you want the gist. I’ll chat to it if I want to learn about a subject as if talking to a once knowledgeable friend with a lapsed memory. I did this quite recently with the European conquest of America. It’s quite funny if you spot an obvious error and point it out. It will always correct itself, but of course it’s all a magic show and a re-weighting. And if you want to break it with logic it’s trivially easy to do so. The current version is far better than that of a couple of years back, but I do feel they are capping out on the current path. The rate of progress has slowed, but the illusion of intelligence is still more amazing to me than not. 🙂 There’s an evens chance we’re moving mostly away from a search engine paradigm to an ‘answer engine’ paradigm, so at the least good to keep a toe in as I see it. It’s a painful budget but in my view necessary as we can’t go on with the underfunding and lack of investment in our public services. See crumbling schools, overflowing prisons, highest ever NHS waiting lists, endless strikes, etc etc. If anything I think they did a decent job of spreading the pain around, a bit on pensioners, a bit on workers, a bit on business, a bit on landlords/investors, a bit on the wealthy. And all within the constraints of the manifesto commitments (sort of). I did work out how much extra tax my employer will now pay in NI for me and it’s quite a lot, so I fully expect a smaller wage increase next year. But it seemed like a reasonable way to reverse some of Jeremy Hunt’s blatant electioneering. I’m glad they didn’t touch the ISA allowance and only made minor amends to CGT. I feel like they could have been bolder with regards council tax, but maybe that’ll be after the next election maybe, when Labour are more trusted on the economy (assuming things go okay from here). Now they’ve got the unpopular stuff out of the way it should be easier over the next 4 years to give a good news story of how they’re turning the economy around, much like Osborne and Cameron did from 2010 to 2015. Some of the stamp duty changes are a bit mad, ie allowing the thresholds to reduce in Apr’25 and increasing the additional home charge to 5%. (The latter will only bring in £200-£300m tax revenue so just seemed like a bit of a swipe at 2nd home owners and landlords, still they didn’t increase CGT on property at least.) Will be interesting to see how those changes affect the housing market and rental supply over the next 6-12 months. All in all though it’s good to have adults back in charge actually trying to improve the country rather than the Tory Brexit psychodrama, the neverending Boris scandals, or the Truss/Tufton Street madness. Now we can just laugh at Badenoch when she says crazy things and not have to worry that she’ll actually be able to fulfill any of it. @BBlimp — If you don’t know where I got the 4-5% figure from then you (a) haven’t been following the news (b) haven’t been reading the links I sent you. Okay, let’s put the ChatGPT thing to one side. Here are those arch liberalists, Goldman Sachs, earlier this year: Post-Brexit Britain has “significantly underperformed” other advanced economies since the 2016 EU referendum, according to new analysis from Goldman Sachs, which aims to quantify the economic cost of the Leave vote. In a note last week entitled “The Structural and Cyclical Costs of Brexit,” the Wall Street bank estimates that the U.K. economy grew 5% less over the past eight years than other comparable countries. The true hit to the British economy could be anywhere from 4% to 8% of real gross domestic product (GDP), however, the bank said, acknowledging the difficulties of extracting the impact of Brexit from other simultaneous economic events including the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2022 energy crisis. Real GDP is a growth metric that has been adjusted for inflation. https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/brexit-has-sliced-5percent-off-uk-economic-growth-goldman-sachs-says.html Google around. It’s an easy question for ChatGPT to answer because all sensible reports find roughly the same thing. I was only replying to @David as a courtesy for the reasons he gave. Enough Brexit for this thread please. @24Tom-Baker Dr Who, my work around involves gifts of capital gains bloated ETFs to charity and is best explained by an example. Let’s say I take £250k from my SIPP and give £200k of ETFs to charity. The taxable amount is reduced by £200k and then by about £12.5k by the personal allowance, leaving about £37.5k. Tax on that at 20% is £7.5k, so I have about £242.5k net cash from the SIPP after the tax refund comes through. Put £20k into an ISA, then live off and distribute the rest. There is no CGT to pay on the gift of the ETFs to charity. If this process is repeated regularly over a few years the gifts to relatives would be considered gifts from income instead of PETs. The original plan for our SIPPs was eventually to take an income from them at basic rate, topped up by ISA withdrawals once our GIA investments were gone, and then to leave the SIPPs to relatives after we die, but there is little point following that path now. Instead we will make large withdrawals and distribute surplus income to 15 nephews and nieces. They are in their 30s to early 40s and most of them are sensible with money now, a few not. Only a couple are high earners and the money will be very useful to them. Likely far more useful now than in 25 years or so. “Britain signed up for gentle decline years ago” Yes, that’s the reality the UK has to face. It’s all about access to cheap energy and the UK no longer has that. There’s an economic inflexion taking place, but nobody (especially politicians) wants to face the cold hard facts of what such a phase transition entails. https://surplusenergyeconomics.wordpress.com/2024/11/02/292-fake-it-till-you-break-it/ @TI “Policing this thread to keep comments on the Budget topic from here.” Thank goodness for that, I don’t come here to read Daily Wail claptrap. I was beginning to think someone might pop by to say that Brexit failed because of the millions of trans Muslims arriving on little boats, being given council houses, claiming collosal benefits, breeding like rabbits, raping our women and stealing our jobs. It costs a lot to mend public services after 14 years worth of them being run into the ground. I’m not sure that increasing ENI will be the way to improve growth and the projected figures from the OBR look underwhelming at best. As for productivity in the NHS – loads of capital investment needed in diagnostics – things like scanners many of which are currently past their sell-by date and constantly breaking down. It’s also difficult to treat more patients when the building is falling down and they’re presenting as older, sicker with more co-morbidities and can’t be discharged because to all intents and purposes social care has been left to fall apart. As for getting rid of loads of diversity NHS staff – there aren’t that many according to official figures and they are a current legal requirement arising from the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) – something that’s never mentioned in the red-top comics. Following all the precursive doom-mongering, relieved that the somewhat vanilla (from a personal finance perspective) budget seems instantly forgotten with the slightest flutter of the other ‘B’ word red-rag. Although not so much into the politics, there doesn’t seem to be much that’s going to start swinging the ship round. At least they haven’t scuttled it. The Budget ? It proves that turkeys do vote for Christmas. The fault lies with the hopeless previous Conservative administration however. If I had a plan to build say more schools and hospitals and wanted you to pay for it how would I go about it ? Would I assess where they were needed, get them designed, get the approvals and permissions in place, get initial costs, put them out to tender…. Then I would need the money. Takes a while. Or I would ask for the money now, without plans or numbers, and say trust me. I won’t spend the money on anything else while I am waiting. At least I know when I am being plucked. After years of experience so I should. I concur that, on the face of it, those of us who keep things simple, with a single home, pension – such as a salary sacrifice DC and/or SIPP, and wrap any non-pension wealth in ISAs should probably breath a sigh of relief. TI makes a good point that we can still sock away £80k pa in tax advantageous accounts. They haven’t even hiked council tax – I am sure this will come for the top 2 or 3 bands in the next budget. Any pay rise next year is likely to be reduced by my employer to compensate for their NI hikes, but that seems to be the worst of it – although this is with a very narrow personal finance focus. I might have been more annoyed if I was planning to use my pension to dodge IHT, as an irate Labour voting colleague was. “But aren’t you happy it is going to the NHS?” I stopped myself from saying. Will leave the political commentary at that, but keen to hear if people think any of the leaked household wealth taxing policies the press made such a fuss about will make an appearance in next year’s budget. @TI Not a reply on Brexit, but on AI……that was a really clear well explained reply, that meant I did not have to hunt around for something as clear. I was speaking to a business owner the other day who when WFH uses some readily available AI (not CGP) to bounce off ideas as if they were a very knowledgeable work colleague – and gets a consistently better response. Which heralds businesses being managed in the future by one person + AI …. Bottomline is that this budget – it’s priorities for investment and how it wants to allocate the cost for them – will all be rendered obsolete by ‘Events, dear boy, events’. It’s hard to imagine that many of the forecasts beyond 25/26 survive contact with the global economy. Moreover, the forecasts assume levels of public sector productivity growth that look heroic. Health/Social care generating 2%/annum? Yes, right! One of those events happens on Tuesday and it will have a far greater impact on UK finances than this budget. The big three economic blocs – US, Europe and China – will decide how our economy performs and whether we can afford those public services. We’ll just have react, as best we can, to their decisions. That’s the nature of being an relatively small, open economy on the periphery of major regional blocs. I accept the IHT on pensions, but I do find it irksome that the billionaires who have snapped up farmland have only been asked to pay 20%, but us relatively little guys are being charged 40%. @Southbank 13. Re moving. Don’t forget a 10 year rule is coming into effect next year. The whole thing is beginning to get a flavour of serfdom. Just a quick note on my comment about the Daily Heil encouraging people to take comutation before the budget. Their headline “I took money out my pension before the budget.Can I put it back in” https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-14029673/I-took-tax-free-cash-pension-Budget.html “ with a potential AI revolution at the door.” I’ve been pondering this for a while in a different context. Warren Buffett has sold some of his Apple shares and is sat on pile of cash. Because: everything is too expensive. Prem Watsa is doing the same., citing the same reason. In fairness, the All Market index does appear to have gone up a bit since 2008, and tech stocks seem to be doing rather well. What do you think? Is this reflective of the AI revolution or just another dot.com bubble? I recon, differently from flickr, meebo, wikiyou, mahalo and bebo Apple, Google and Amazon have a thing called revenue. Of course post-COVID money printing has helped the equity valuations, but now that the money is printed and can’t be inflated away (not without a change in government both here and across the pond, it appears) then it must be here to stay in the form of capital… but does that explain all of the gains? And if not, then is the rest of it irrational exuberance? And if so, then how much? and if it’s a lot, what should I do about it? And should I really be paying out good old Warren for managing a money market fund? I hate timing the market, mainly because I’m very bad at it. The only time I called it right was March 2020 (buy! buy it now!), and even then I was hobbled by insufficient cash to “clean up”, as the kids these days call it. Thoughts? Overall seems a fair budget and personally I’m happy with the IHT changes. I wonder if the IHT change could have a big impact on some people? An unmarried / not in a civil partnership couple in a reasonable sized home and savings would likely have managed to keep under the IHT threshold. But with pensions now included this could easily push people over the limit meaning getting married / entering a civil partnership could be a useful tax planning option / investment to consider for anyone now impacted. On the AI discussion – I’m a big user of ChatGPT for work and personal – it’s useful to check details with – although it’s not perfect so it pays to check. A recent example was seeing which broker was cheapest following @TA’s recent article. I put the details noted in TA’s article (portfolio amount, monthly trades, etc) into ChatGPT, asked it to check a range of brokers, and it did all the leg work. > ChatGPT Is there a decent guide written by man or machine in how to use this and for what sort of queries? Whenever I go anywhere near it the answers fall into Pauli’s ‘so bad it’s not even wrong’ category. It lies to me with impunity and is delusional enough to appear permanently on acid. @all — Really great discussion, loving the range of thoughtful view. Cheers! @ermine — Me and @TA both thought this was very good: https://www.profgalloway.com/what-does-ai-think/ Hope it’s helpful. I’d say don’t treat it as the font of perfect knowledge. (We’ll really be screwed if/when it is or we can’t fool it at least, anyway 😉 ) More as I said like a knowledgeable but forgetful and maybe a bit braggardy/bluffery friend. I’ve emailed you by the way to the SLIS address about another matter. I feel this Govts further rise to CGT is massive – 8% more on lower rate and 4% on higher rate and this was after the recent Tory rises in reducing the annual exempt allowance from £12300 down to the now pitiful £3000 which was huge enough in itself. “Squeeze you until the pips squeak” comes to mind. Wouldn’t mind quite so much if Tories/Labour ever used it wisely/efficiently and things actually improved – but do they ever actually – not in my experience just more waste/fraud/inefficiency/incompetence/corruption/expenses scandals and the like. A plague on both your houses!! Some of us do have GIA investments and try to live from them – this is now much harder – as well as all the more CG tax returns being a right old PITA. Can now hardly divest anything much without incurring big tax bill. I use my annual ISA subscription but not working now so can’t use pension tax shelter – except the minimum allowed, which again is a pittance. It may be gains but we already pay tax on the original investment on earned income and then there’s inflation which is not accounted for reducing it more, particularly over recent years. What are they trying to do – stop us investing altogether? So when you need to sell most years for your income/living expenses and even to do Bed&Isa/small amount for SIPP – it’s a disaster pretty much all round. We’ve really got a choice of either not selling/letting gains build up even more (or maybe just sell a pitiful amount to diffuse your annual £3k which isn’t gonna make much difference) and taking from say, Isa accounts in the meantime and hoping tax rates are reduced in not too distant future but probably won’t happen anytime soon (and then can’t use your ISA allowance each year either) or sell and pay these punative tax rates to fill Isas and extract living expenses. Seems it will hit those harder who aren’t/can’t work who need to extract regularly. With regard to Bed & ISA though since the budget, Vanguard’s recent budget article discussed the merits of still doing this/taking the tax hit versus doing nothing. I suppose many will have seen this already but Vanguard say: “We calculated the potential increase in returns that a higher-rate taxpayer could realise by using bed and ISA every year, based on the new CGT rate of 24%. In our hypothetical example, the investor starts off with both a general account and an ISA, valued at £100,000 each. They invest in a portfolio which returns 5% a year after costs and then sell the investments after 10 years, paying CGT due on the remaining general account balance. The chart below shows the difference it would make if they depleted their general account over five years (by moving £20,000 a year into their ISA) compared with doing nothing. By diligently making the most of bed and ISA, the individual ends up with £15,304 more, despite holding exactly the same investments.” This is the article and this is discussed under the heading “What else can I do to reduce my CGT bill?”: https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/articles/latest-thoughts/markets-economy/what-the-autumn-statement-means-for-you?cmpgn=ET1024UKTLABU0101EN&guid=&nuid= At least they say that we’re generally better off to still do Bed & ISA and take the tax hit as then protected from taxes in future years – maybe until they next meddle. @TI (various posts) Normally I would say just delete BBlimp, however, you name checked him in your post so he had the right to reply. The second best thing is to ignore his ignorance. @Plague Dr Another reason it may be worth eating the hit w CGT steadily as your capgain seems to add to your income for that year as far as defining your tax bracket. In many ways Hunt’s original drop of the allowance from 12k p.a. was more significant for me, but the details will vary with the individual situation. Feels strange to think of reversing the old advice to keep income investments in the ISA to booting them out into the GIA and shifting capital growth stuff into the ISA to take their place @TI ta – at least it diagnosed my usage error. I am not particularly collegiate in problem solving. My mother got my primary school headmaster to take ‘is a lone wolf’ out of my valedictory report. He was right… So I may struggle to use it as thought partner. But it’s good to know the source of the fail. I was/am that nail basher with a screwdriver, my bad 😉 @Mack: “gifting the family home …”: be sure to get professional advice on how to do it in such a way that you retain your Residential Nil Rate Band versus IHT. “the risk of not surviving the seven years, etc.”: you can buy insurance that would give your beneficiaries enough cash to pay the estate’s IHT if you snuff it early. Professional advice could help you ensure that the insurance pay out was not part of your estate. I’ve been looking around the web for useful suggestions for fruitful ways of avoiding IHT on our (modest) SIPPs. So far: (i) Withdraw our TFLSs over three tax years and gift the money as surplus income – that way those gifts are IHT-free on despatch and income-tax-free on receipt. (ii) Instruct that each SIPP go to the other on death – no IHT to pay on first death. (iii) Expect to use the surviving capital to buy an Immediate Needs Annuity to help with the cost of “care”; if the annuity is paid direct to the care provider the payment incurs no income tax. (iv) Since the SIPPs are indeed modest, and 75% of them will be even more modest, the survivor of us will probably need to buy a further INA using money from ISAs. So be it. Maybe we won’t need the survivor to buy care but family medical history suggests otherwise. @Naeclue (#52) – Thanks! Your charity donations idea is interesting. It doesn’t suit me though as I have no GIA just SIPPs and ISAs. My plan so far is to make large withdrawals and gift surpluses, as you mentioned you will do too after you drawdown all your GIAs. I think it’s not an awful budget, although could have been better. The increase in employer NIC will hit hard on medium enterprises with tight profit margins. But for businesses with decent margins, there would be scope to carry that extra cost without choosing to hit pay or recruitment by eating into the margin a little, and let’s not pretend that it won’t be a choice if the business prefers to protect the profit margin. Personally I’ll be affected by IHT on pensions, and as I’m contemplating buying a second property the stamp duty increase. On pensions I think taking it into IHT makes sense (doesn’t hit the person who built up the funds, tax free on both money in and investment return let’s not forget, and only affects their heirs if the joint estate exceeds £1m). Less comfortable about the double tax potential if you die after age 75: if the fund bears IHT why would beneficiaries also have to pay income tax? They would not on other assets in the estate such as isa funds. There are also some points such as death in service sums from a workplace scheme that ought not to be subject to IHT. I’m not sure if they were intended to be caught (the consultation paper implies they will ) . @Xeny (#29) – It is not a comparison. It is just an observation of how they performed so far with almost no help from us. It’s also an optimistic hope that this will carry on 🙂 @Nebilon Less comfortable about the double tax potential if you die after age 75: if the fund bears IHT why would beneficiaries also have to pay income tax? They would not on other assets in the estate such as isa funds. I guess the rationale is that the pension sum was accrued from pre-tax income whereas other assets, including ISAs, are created/purchased from post-tax income. So, by treating it as beneficiaries’ taxable income transforms it into a post-tax amount in the same way that the original pension owner drawing down would have done. @dearieme (70 iii & iv) I don’t think you can use SIPP capital to buy an Immediate Needs Annuity – except of course by withdrawing the capital and paying the presumably large tax bill first. Thank you @Naeclue, your thoughts in post #52 are very useful. @Bob #16 said: “>But what was amusing was the Daily Mail publishing two or three articles a day in the run up with panicking suggestions to take pensions now and get the maximum commutation before the evil Chancellor reduced it. >The day after the DM headlines were that people who did this were tricked by the same evil Chancellor who caused the panic” Made me laugh too. Had she said anything to try to calm the panic down, she would probably also have been blamed by them for leaking budget details in advance. (I think I am getting old and cynical.) @dearieme (70) Re my comment at #75, I’ve just realised that you are only contemplating purchase of the INA after inheritance of the SIPP proceeds tax-free by the survivor. Scanning the comments above – I think possibly the ‘ease’ some of you find opening and managing sipps and ISAs and hammering down every little bit of cost may be leading you to believe continuing to go it alone without advice in retirement and death planning is for the best. Might even be you could get one off advice for specific circs if insistent on not getting ongoing advice. I would have thought, in most cases, as we’re talking about in the main £1million (or at the very least £325k) surely there’s scope for an advisor to add value. @Plague – forgive me for asking but did you max out Tessa/Pep/Isa/ pension allowances on the way up ? Interesting set of comments both good and bad. My overall impression for me is of a frog being slowly boiled. @Matt, the left are pro-Brexit, seeing the EU as a capitalist enterprise against the interests of workers. Being anti-Brexit is mostly about arithmetic. I was surprised after all the kite flying the budget was as reasonable as it was . It will hit me when (if ) my employer sells and my stake is realised by another 4% but that’s about it and that’s 4% of something I’ve never had so I can’t really complain and I still get to keep 76% of it .the pension being included in IHT wasn’t unexpected and is also fair I believe thoughi think the iht limit should be higher (but that’s not borne out by the reality of the countries demographics as shown below) . As another commentator has said if you’re affairs are simple with isas pensions one property no kids At private school then it can be summed up as ‘move along nothing to see here other than some iht planning’ . Fvlondons article also seems to bear this out. It’ll barely make a dent for him and he’s far further up the wealth bracket . Also on topic of the country being poor with a few rich people, I took a Telegraph test last night (don’t judge it was a free trial) and with a net worth of £1.2m I’m apparently in the top 2% of the country. Their sources for the data do seem accurate and if so that seems to bear this out (bear in mind that’s across all age brackets and I’m only in my 40’s so the majority of millionaires are likely to be in their 60’s) . That staggers though doesn’t surprise me .there’s definitely a skew in people’s perception of how wealthy they are (as evidenced by a client of mine with a net worth almost into 8 figures bemoaning Labour coming after the ‘middle classes’) I wish I was middle class ! But if I’m barely affected as one of the 2% then has the budget really fallen on those with the broadest shoulders? Having run around the Internet……… Pensions are for pensions only The potential £200000 IHT hit with the new regime is one for the kids to deal with -if it arises-carehome fees? Small house(£200000) – with rest of investments in stocks,bonds and cash-easily realisable for IHT bills Kids all financially independent and will get still something quite reasonable as an inheritance Not going to alter my financial setup at this late stage which is simple and easy for a 78 year old codger like me(and my executors) Keeping calm and carrying on! xxd09 I am genuinely interested, to those who say extra taxes and higher spending will just be wasted, how do you propose we fix the problems of: overflowing prisons, crumbling schools, and an ageing population (to name just 3). Is it just better allocation of resources in which case, where do you take the resources from? Presumably you also want to increase defence spending to 2.5 or 3%, so where’s that money going to come from? As far as I can tell we’ve tried austerity for the last 14 years, we’ve tried cutting back on spending and making efficiency savings everywhere, and what has that achieved? It hasn’t exactly turned the country into a beautiful utopia, quite the opposite in fact. Hmm. No kids, so while nieces/nephews will get mostly everything they’ve been whammied (hopefully a long time in the future). That said if I have to pay tax I’d rather it be when I’m dead and the treatment did seem unduly generous. If some future government brings us some unforseen economic success then maybe they’ll actually increase IHT thresholds to stop many more estates being dragged in as this change will prompt. Guess I can always draw and gift sometime in my 70s when I have a better idea of where I stand potwise vs the grim reaper. If anything it’s probably strengthened my resolve to RE. Far better return from the portfolio if I spend it than it gets sucked up by a potential 64% tax hit when my beneficiaries inherit (assuming they are HRT workers when they inherit the SIPP). @wephway, your ability to follow what is going on is hampered by your dogma, but police/courts/prisons got a 2pc cut. How’s that fit with your comment above? Labour are taxing and borrowing more, and spending less on some public services. What are they spending more on ? State pensions and the NHS It’s because NHS spending per capita has risen by 2pc in real terms every year since 2014 on average but produce worse outcomes that people are fed up with it. The only people that are pro NHS now have private health insurance, the virtue signalling classes who happy for people to lie on the floor for 16 hours waiting for an ambulance as long as they can signal how they love ‘our’ NHS. How is it Australia, France, Canada, Germany all get better health outcomes for similar spend ? The NHS will continue to suck money out of all the other public services and produce similar outcomes – why should the next 14 years be any different to the last ? – so we’ll be stuck in a crazy world where tax can be at highest it’s ever been yet you think there is austerity. @xxd – I think in many ways you’ve absolutely nailed life – had kids now grown up and don’t want to spend any more money (which has to be a workable definition of rich). Personally I still think you should get advice, see if anything can be done. Let’s face it, you can afford it. Looking back do you wish you’d spent more in different parts of your life ? Like on family holidays or childcare or anything ? @BBlimp Please back up your assertions on NHS spending, and per capita healthcare spending comparison with other countries with data from a reliable source. Even if real terms spending had gone up, that would be appropriate given increased demand (medicine changes all the time, what can be done done for patients with a given disease increases the bill as do other population factors). @Fatbritabroad, I think it worth considering the breakdown of the tax increases across those who are financially independent, that might be the top 2%, might be a bit more, I don’t really know. People who (at least) own their own their home outright and have sufficient pensions and investment income to cover their lifestyle. There is a huge range in wealth across this FI group, but it looks to me as though the increase in tax has not been put on those with the “broadest shoulders”. The IHT to pay on pensions is a rounding error to billionaires, as is the freeze on tax thresholds. Billionaires without farms have been asked to pay more CGT, but this is easily avoided by not crystallising gains. Income tax on dividends has not gone up, the capital gain to the date of death is still not taxed, Rate of IHT is unchanged and taxation of Trusts is unchanged. Ok, those with farms will be hit for IHT, but only at 20% and there will be 10 years to pay that. Why not have 20% over £1m and 40% over say £10m? No it looks to me as though it is the lower end of the FIs that have taken the biggest knocks. @Alex, or should I call you jr dr Alex ? https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/data-and-charts/nhs-budget-nutshell https://www.statista.com/statistics/283221/per-capita-health-expenditure-by-country/ Yes it is shocking. @xxd – almost loathe to mention this, but there may be scope to upgrade to a bigger house, to maximise the residential allowance (assuming you’re married or in a civil partnership and no other factors at play). @FatBritabroad “Also on topic of the country being poor with a few rich people, I took a Telegraph test last night (don’t judge it was a free trial) and with a net worth of £1.2m I’m apparently in the top 2% of the country.” Not sure on what basis the Torygraph calculates this. The most reliable source of UK wealth data is the ONS Wealth and Assets Survey which calculates wealth on a household basis. Their last release was 2018-20 data (they are struggling with low resources but have told me they plan to release the 2020-22 dataset by the New Year). This is now out-of-date but at that time 13% of UK households had a net worth (including pensions and property) in excess of £1.2 million. The percentage will be significantly higher now due to inflation and asset appreciation. So even if the Torygraph was trying to measure on an individual (rather than a household) basis, the 2% figure they have given you seems likely to be wrong. Might help explain why the Chancellor’s targeting of those with the broadest shoulders didn’t affect you! @TI not allowing my response to Alex makes it look like I’m unable to support my claim with evidence. Hopefully he can Google the result ??? https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/data-and-charts/nhs-budget-nutshell Yes it is shocking. And no, don’t assume we’re happy to continue paying for it. @BBlimp there really is no need for personal attacks, I could say the same to you about ‘dogma’. So your answer is we’re spending too much on the NHS and state pensions? To some extent I agree regards state pensions, the triple lock in my view is unsustainable. However I suspect many (especially in the right wing press) would kick up a never ending stink if the triple lock got taken away, see the reaction from means testing winter fuel payments. The NHS is complex and I don’t pretend to know the answers there, so you may have a point. I agree some sort of reform is needed and something is going wrong as productivity appears to be falling. Having said that, with an ageing population I expect we will need to keep putting in real terms increases in spending on the NHS for the foreseeable. Whether that’s through some kind of insurance based system like France or Canada (I note you don’t mention the US), or by sticking with the NHS, spending is still going to keep going up. Regards a 2pct cut on police/prisons/courts, I haven’t seen that anywhere in the news, care to share where you heard that? @BBlimp — Your response is literally posted above and was at the time you wrote this. Your post went into auto-moderation because (a) it contained links and (b) your posts have been identified by the automatic spam checker as the sort of thing Russian bots etc post I suppose. Re: your earlier screed today about how ‘sad’ it was that I delete your comments about Brexit, while I’m here let me restate again. Your posts about Brexit add nothing to the site. You don’t bring any value except a ‘contrary’ view which is just standard right-wing talking points. I’ve revealed the ongoing Brexit damp squib-to-real damage over the years by the ongoing statistics. You and your two to three acolytes just talk about censorship and accuse somebody who reads more widely than any of you (see the range of views in the links above) of a blinkered world view. I moderate this site to keep the comment thread vibrant, in contrast to the unreadable threads elsewhere on the web. Over the years you’ve demonstrated you sit squarely towards the ‘troll’ end of the comment spectrum, for reasons I feel no compunction to go into here. I’d happily just delete you until you go away and probably should, but I’m soft-hearted and endlessly optimistic. Hope this helps. @wephway Day-to-day spending on NHS and education in England to rise by 4.7% in real terms this year, before smaller rises next year Defence spending to rise by £2.9bn next year Home Office budget to shrink by 3.1% this year and 3.3% next year in real terms, due to assumed savings from asylum system £1.3bn extra funding next year for local councils, which will also keep all cash from Right to Buy sales from next month https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxl1zd07l1o.amp @tortoise, @alex I might be easy to dismiss – but when Wephway is questioning NHS productivity it’s time you guys realise the public has woken up to the fact the NHS is run poorly, for the benefit of the staff, and people are noticing. I think the title of the article sums it all up very well. Unsurprising in my view that the budget itself felt like a bit of a nothing burger, the angst in the build up was clearly overbought. As ever political philosophy will be a source of endless debate and conflict but from a purely practical personal investing POV the outcome was broadly a relief. The political debate doesn’t need stoking anymore but I can’t help but vent at the triumph of ideology over pragmatism that is private school VAT. No-one could question the idea of an equal education system and perfect meritocracy but that’s not what this achieves and the govnt’s hackneyed “State school parents have aspirations for their children too” is a cynical evasion of addressing the tangible outcome of the policy in practical terms. It is to educational equality what the British ISA was to a UK capital markets renaissance only this one hurts people. The destructive effects on the marginal private school family are clear, the potential for constructive benefits for a state school family when the second and third order impacts of families shifting sectors net out aren’t. Probably an unpopular opinion but the fact truly vast wealth (Grosvenor etc) can transcend generations via trusts and/or gifts entirely free of tax makes tighter IHT rules at least at the very top of the spectrum a more compelling place to look at progressive taxes to support state education @BBlimp “Home Office budget to shrink by 3.1% this year and 3.3% next year in real terms, due to assumed savings from asylum system” Still not seeing how you get from that to a 2pct cut to courts/prisons/police? Is there more detail somewhere about this, or what the ‘assumed savings’ are? @BBlimp – your statista link doesn’t say anything about outcomes but in terms of expenditure per capita it looks like Canada spends 15% more than the UK, France and Australia 18-20% more and Germany 45% more. On the reasons for health spending rising in real terms these are well known as @Alex says. @faustus thanks that makes more sense at that kind of level Their source is quoted as Household total wealth by percentiles: ONS – Household total wealth in Great Britain, March 2020, figures adjusted by Consumer Price Index; For those interested in a rigorous comparison of the NHS with other countries the kingsfund report linked at https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/blogs/comparing-nhs-to-health-care-systems-other-countries might be worth a read. While the situation is no doubt far more complicated than any of us appreciate here, it would appear that underinvestment in staff (low in both doctors and nurses) and facilities (e.g., high bed occupancy rates – if only we had some new hospitals!) may very well contribute to poor health outcomes. The overwhelming of GP services (e.g., the city I live in has one of the worst patient to GP ratios in the country) probably doesn’t help with treating conditions that benefit from being diagnosed early. Hopefully, the increased investment in the NHS will at least begin to address some of the issues. ps. Part of the abstract in the main report reads as follows: “The UK has below-average health spending per person compared to peer countries. Health spending as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) was just below average in 2019 but rose to just above average in 2020 (the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, which of course had a significant impact on the UK’s economic performance and spending on health services). The UK lags behind other countries in its capital investment, and has substantially fewer key physical resources than many of its peers, including CT and MRI scanners and hospital beds. The UK has strikingly low levels of key clinical staff, including doctors and nurses, and is heavily reliant on foreign-trained staff. Remuneration for some clinical staff groups also appears to be less competitive in the UK than in peer countries.” BBlimp -don’t think I would do anything differently My wife had 10 years “off” till our third kid had gone to primary school-probably why the kids did so well! Very much our choice Only ever bought a small house so they can’t come back-suits a retired couple though! One daughter a GP -tells me practices don’t have enough cash to employ more GPs-they are too expensive Imagine the Tory party having a first generation immigrant Nigerian lady as leader-take the Labour Party a while to catch up with that one! Aren’t politicians and economies such fun -roll on Wednesday and the US elections xxd09 @FatBritabroad No problem. The Torygraph seems to be referencing the right source but not the correct figures (a legacy perhaps from their infamous columnist, A. B. de Pfeffel Johnson?). The actual ONS source referenced is linked here – see Figure 2 which breaks down Household Total Wealth in March 2020 by percentile: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/totalwealthingreatbritain/april2018tomarch2020 Even with the triple lock on pensions it still lower than most .imagine if that was taken.careful what you wish for with a little luck you will be in receipt one day.Although as readers here you may not care @BBlimp #79 Yes always maxxed tessa’s/peps/isas – used to have mixture of cash/S&S but nowadys just have S&S. But pensions not as much for couple of reasons. No workplace pension so no employer contributions and back when I started at 21 only old style personal pensions – no sipps or stakeholders then. One thing was no access to the funds until some much older age wasn’t an option when I would likely need it. Later on I also found many of these pensions to be a rip off with hidden/secretive/back door charges & commissions – even when I asked my pension advisor he never disclosed exactly what charges were being taken (except the AMC and usual stuff on the yearly pension review statement) but performance was poor. I was even recommended to this pension by an IFA in the first place – pretty much hopeless – and he took commission as well as was before fee based advice came in. Another pension I took out few years later was similar, so kinda put me off these pretty much. One of these advisors also recommended a couple of S&S isas. I expected a one off commission for the advice but wasn’t told of the ongoing trail commissions being taken every year until many years later the fund manager happened to mention it when I rang about something. No wonder they never really performed very well over many years. So no fan of financial advisors at all. Pensions nowadays – I no longer work, although still working age, due to medical conditions. Reviewed pensions and decided to transfer to DIY sipps and transferred S&S isas also to DIY platforms. Since then all have done much better – no comparison in my view. But now can only contribute the paltry maximum £2880 + T/R per annum to them which I do. Not much but get the 25% T/R on contributions and 25% TFLS when draw so better than a boot in the nuts. Agree with you on the NHS – although the whole country is in a complete mess – what exactly do they spend all the money on as nothing improves. The NHS is a black hole into which we pour our taxes and get diminishing returns/poor service and only ever seems to get worse. Complete reform is needed/maybe different model as this doesn’t work and neither have previous reforms from recent past. Have a lot of experience of NHS for myself and family since around 2003 and it has got much worse with many mistakes and unacceptable level of service from Gp’s & hospitals and very rude and abrubt staff. Have had to make complaints but these don’t lead anywhere – they ensure that. Family members even had a solicitor for a strong case of negligence where their mistakes very nearly caused a family member to die was it not for another family member intervening and having to be rushed back into emergency surgery. However they had to abandon the case as solicitors said the NHS would not provide information and had “closed ranks” to prevent it. Also one consultant said to me, in front of my parents, that “it may be better if my mother died as less of a burden for me” when she was only in a wheelchair due to osteo arthritis and also some mild memory problems. Could go on with many more including my own treatment which has been both useless and horrendous. But Dr’s/nurses/GP’s still seem to demand more/strike half the time for a joke of a service. Some even state they have to use foodbanks when I know people on the minimum wage who manage without quite okay – they shouldn’t even be allowed near a foodbank – what exactly do they do with their money? I think most earn enough – and many earn far more than they are ever worth in my experience. @BBlimp. How can day to day spending go up that much within a year other than boosting salaries? How many years and other efforts) will be needed to turn available cash into additional trained staff, buildings or equipment ? Can it really go anywhere other than public sector pay rises? If it does, it isn’t available for investment downstream. It could have been used to help tackle the deficit but nope borrowing uis on the up too. I think commentary on this budget has been a bit ingenuous, it’s priority looks more like boosting public sector pay. We have had a good plucking justified by just stated intentions but without justification and no clarification of quantified objectives or planned routes. I don’t understand how anyone can applaud this budget given the vacuum of tangible plans. Give me the money now and I’ll tell you what you have bought next year. @BBlimp #79 > may be leading you to believe continuing to go it alone without advice in retirement and death planning is for the best There’s not much that I agree with BBlimp on but this is one thing I wholeheartedly do agree on, particularly if there are concerns about care. Some of the products for care provision, such as a purchased life annuity are only available through IFAs, because the providers don’t want the hassle of compliance and mis-selling liability. It is the job of the IFA to take this risk off them. Search for an IFA that is part of SOLLA. One of these served my late mother very well. Sure, the PLA was in hindsight a misallocation of capital, though not terribly, but it was the right way to go because of the floor it put under the risk. @DavidV: thank you for your two remarks. One financial comments thread told me that you can buy an Immediate Needs Annuity with cash inside a SIPP – but if the commenter was wrong, he was wrong. Monevator used to carry occasional pieces by a financial advisor – Mark Meldon – who seemed to have a really useful grasp on insurance, annuities, and so on but I’ve not seen a piece by him in ages. Maybe I should look through the archives. As you inferred our likeliest outcome is that I’ll die first, my SIPP will go to my widow and she might later use it for an INA – assuming that that never becomes seen as an evil loophole in desperate need of plugging. Meantime we have started a logical response to the budget – for the first time in donkey’s we went out for a decent lunch at the weekend. Then we bought two new mattresses. Then I started to investigate sources of aged Aussie Rieslings. Ooh, the high life, eh? @BBlimp Feel free to call me Alex. You can call me doctor if you’re feeling particularly deferential, but I’m not a junior doctor. It looks like others have pointed out that one of your links does not back up your assertions. Allow me to give an example that might help to explain why the NHS is something of a bottomless pit. Maybe ten years ago, probably less, if you got endometrial cancer you would have biopsy, the cancer would be diagnosed in a lab, then you would have your surgery. The lab would stage the cancer and that would determine whether you needed further treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy). Today, the lab would do two additional tests on your biopsy. Possibly a third depending on the results. And you might even get referred for genetic counselling and further testing for a cancer syndrome depending on the results of the third test. You’ll probably have an MRI scan before your surgery. All these results would be used to decide whether you’ll need more involved surgery (such as sentinel lymph node biopsy). Once the lab have staged the tumour (now a more involved process with more data points to report) you might get chemotherapy, radiotherapy, a new targeted therapy (expensive). Oh, and if you turn out to have that cancer syndrome, you’ll be offered additional care (such as screening for bowel cancer) and the invitation for genetic testing may be extended to your family members too. Imagine the additional resources required for all this and then add all the other changes to medical care in the last 10 years and marvel that the NHS has managed what it has. Measuring productivity as targets met or appointments offered or whatever is inevitably flawed. I don’t know where we’ll end up. Maybe the taxpayer will decide that we don’t want to pay for state of the art care for everything and we’ll have to decide what to ration. Personally I think it would be a moral tragedy if we end up with anything remotely resembling US health care, although I’d certainly be better off financially. On the subject of protecting the natural world and the value of biodiversity, I highly recommend Silent Earth by Dave Goulsen. And finally, I shall leave you with a personal anecdote. When my brother took my ranty, bigoted, brexiteer father on holiday to Greece, he banned the Daily Mail. My father stopped baiting him on subjects like race or the environment etc and went back to being the lovely man we all knew he really was. Well, for a couple of weeks at least. I do believe he was happier in himself for those two weeks too. Food for thought… It’s disappointing that there seems to be little similarity between the statements from Labour politicians before the election and the new government’s actions since, including the recent budget. Apparently Rachel Reeves said a few days ago that the budget would be a one-off “This is not the sort of Budget we would want to repeat” (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c86q31wlj39o). However the weekend reading linked IFS article suggests the chancellor will increase taxes further as have other commentators e.g. Ros Altmann. Does anyone believe the chancellor will not raise taxes more in the next few years? Worth noting I think that pensions-into-IHT will change the consideration on how to balance SIPP, GIA or ISA, especially for families. For SIPPs the input tax relief could be at lower rate but now there’s more chance of higher rate out. With ISAs money can be gifted under the current rules whenever makes sense without a potential tax uplift. Secondly, going after land billionaires is one thing but 20% IHT on smaller farms is a terrible idea. The yields on small farming aren’t high enough and will force changes on less well off rural communities. We should be encouraging small local producers! Lastly, largely removing entrepreneurs relief or BADR is going the wrong way if you want to encourage more high growth start ups. @dearieme (#71 #109), @DavidV (#76 #78), and others – thank you for your thoughts on possibly gifting the family home earlier to reduce IHT now that pensions are to be brought into the IHT net. I need to revisit Mark Meldon’s guest articles. I need to give this all more thought, draw the decision tree, consider probabilities, and once I have the basics, seek professional advice. Regarding the discussions on wealth, I noticed in the Budget Report that the proposed pension changes are expected to impact fewer estates than I had anticipated: “The government is also removing the opportunity for individuals to use pensions as a vehicle for inheritance tax planning by bringing unspent pots into the scope of inheritance tax from April 2027, which will affect around 8% of estates each year.” On reflection, this might be the point where I stop repeatedly doing ‘one more year’ and start spending more time walking in the Lake District! @Naeclue (#52): Interesting approach – but will registered charities not now be the biggest beneficiaries (as opposed to your relatives)? AIUI “gifts from income” (vs PETs) have to be from income and cannot be from capital (i.e. selling down investments) – do DC pensions qualify? Furthermore, as the exemption is only claimed (and possibly tested) on death it must be fully evidenced as you go along, and it is not unheard of for the rules to change en route to the planned destination. @Nebilon (#73): Good spot re DB’s (“workplace schemes”). Perhaps, as you surmise, they are typos? @Calculus (#112) While I might be wrong (I’m no tax expert), my understanding is that there is £1m of IHT agricultural relief for farms on top of the (potentially) £1m nil-rate band so farms worth up to £2m will be IHT free. Given that shares in the business (or land) can be gifted beforehand, then tax planning ought to be able to minimise IHT. @Al Cam, the charities were going to receive the ETFs anyway. All that has changed is that we will be drawing more from our SIPPs than we had previously intended and passing this to nieces and nephews. Previously relatives were to receive the SIPPs after we died. This will not completely mitigate the IHT on our SIPPs as we will not draw to zero. Having ISAs as the sole tax advantaged accounts is risky as ISAs may be targeted in future budgets. Payments from pensions are counted as income for the “gifts from income” perspective (https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm14250). I don’t believe that is the case with ISAs where I believe cash from disposals would not count as income, but I have yet to find definitive statements to that effect from HMRC. ps Hopefully we will live longer than 7 years after the gifts in any case! Is anyone here using trusts as an IHT management strategy? I’m thinking this may be up Finimus’ street. A solicitor was telling me about the trade offs between 6% every decade and 40% on death, putting 325k in every 7 years, granting yourself 0% loans and things like that. Wondered if anyone here was actually doing any of this stuff? @Rhino I did look into Trusts years ago, but concluded they were not for us. Yes, there is a potential IHT saving, but Trusts are not tax shelters. You have to pay full additional rate tax on income and gains. Beneficiaries can subsequently claim back tax if taxed at lower marginal rates. Then there is the cost of running the Trusts. These can be minimised by buying off the shelf Trusts from insurance companies, but when I looked the choice of investments was poor (no cheap tracker funds). I concluded that it was better to simply gift money to the kids to put into their own ISAs, SIPPs and property. This does mean having to trust that your kids will be sensible with money early on in life! If you don’t then Trusts may be worth considering. ps Trusts may be another sitting duck for hard up chancellors. I was surprised the IHT rate was held at 6%. @Naeclue: Thanks for the reply. I too am pretty sure that this budget is only the beginning – so little if any point in optimising vs the latest situation. I had read that part of the HMRC manual, but other writers have used income from DB pensions – hence my Q, see e.g.: https://www.theprivateoffice.com/insights/gifting-surplus-income IIRC yet other writers have mentioned ISA’s as being acceptable – but as they do not appear in tax returns they require special/additional evidencing. Having said that, ISA acceptability may only extend to cash ISA’s as opposed to S&S ISA’s – for exactly the same reasons [capital vs income] as I have a query re DC pensions. Totally agree re the 7 years – which of course might change too. Re not emptying the SIPPs – I suspect judging how far to run them down will be a tricky calculation, and FWIW, will inevitably adversely effect your withdrawal rate too. Might all of the above even change the calculus re [fixed term?] annuities? My prediction for RR’s phase 2 is: 1 ISA cap of £500k – anything above hopefully can stay but no new subs. 2 Merging income tax and NI – so the basics rate becomes 27.5%. 3 All pensions savings to become “net of tax” + 50% The NI will Hurt pensioners, but that’s where the money is for non-workers. It would cost me a fair bit , but feels semi-rational when all’s said and done @dearieme #109 Yes, having noticed his absence, seemingly since the worst Covid time, I’ve occasionally wondered about Mark Meldon. He was honest about his being a smoker and, hoping very much that I was wrong, I’ve found myself putting two and two together. @dearieme, Factor Mark Meldon appears to be in business still: https://meldonandco.uk/our-people/ A quick look on Companies House shows the company is active (last submitted accounts for year ending 31 March 2024): https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/01797503 #120 Blimey that’s cheery. There has to ultimately be a limit on what taxes can be applied to those not in employment to generate any sense of stability in older age. Politically as well as practically. I’m not sure it’s in anyone’s long term interests to encourage individuals into a “spend, spend, spend” mentality then fall back on the state. I think caps on tax advantaged vehicles seem a reasonable proposition but provided the cap is determined appropriately. The issue with the old LTA (and the LSA) is that a sum of £1m in a SIPP/DC doesn’t really represent a mega amount in annual annuity income (recently saw about £45k in Single life with 3% escalation at age 60). Yet without getting at the “prudent” middle the rump of the meat isn’t there. An ISA contribution cap at £500k doesn’t really mean much more tax generated I suspect. “I noticed in the Budget Report that the proposed pension changes are expected to impact fewer estates than I had anticipated”: ah, but remember that the estate of the first of a couple to die will be free of IHT if passed to the widow. So it’s only the widow’s estate that will be pillaged. The incidence of the tax, though, falls not on the widow but on her beneficiaries who might vary in number from 1 to N . So the number of individuals affected might be pretty large: some will doubtless be toddlers who will thus pay tax at 40% IHT plus whatever income tax bracket they’ll land in when the pension money arrives. Should I write to Kemi and suggest she call it “Two-Tier’s Toddler Tax”? Tempting. A great budget! But Labour must go further… we need: – Scrap tuition fees – only have degree apprenticeships going forward. Make employers pay for all higher education. – Tax homeowners (i.e. 10% CGT on sale of primary residences, 50% CGT on second properties). – Add more council tax bands (with no cap). – A new 50% income tax rate for earners of £250K+ – All flights to be taxed at an extra £50-£100 per person per flight (£50 short-haul, £100 long-haul). – Fuel duty increase of 5p per litre (with haulage to pay 2X this rate). – Double VAT on unhealthy foods: sugar, UPFs, fizzy drinks etc. – Tax social media usage at 1p/min, and 1p per text/msg/email. – Ban phones and social media for anyone medically diagnosed with any mental illness (e.g. ADHD, anxiety, depression etc). – Part-privatize the NHS (make medical insurance compulsory). – All public sector pensions to end, transfer everyone to private DC pensions. – Benefits to be cut by 1% pa until everyone is working (create compulsory jobs as required). Illegal immigration will end if there are no benefits. – End cash payment (CBDCs will mean criminals have no way of getting paid). This would fix the deficit, allow a budget surplus, remove most health problems and crime. Labour needs to do this asap. I do wonder whether there will be a material switch from designating children as beneficiaries of a SIPP* to get the IHT skipped early and possibly a pre 75 benefit to ensuring everything goes to spouse and inflating overall estate on a kick the can down the road basis. In perhaps a vain hope that IHT is eventually lowered/granted higher thresholds. *certainly something I’ve been advising friends to think about if they already have tasty DBs or a spouse with their own decent SIPP. Maybe not widespread. @Curlew @Dearieme @Factor — I have asked Mark to write for us again over the years but I got the impression he felt he’d scratched that issue. Perhaps I’ll drop him a line again. I agree that his pieces added another dimension to the site! @Alan S (115) Thanks, the £2m level would still catch many farms in this part of the world that don’t make huge income, and gifting seems a fair mitigation strategy. One wonders if the 7 year rule and lack of gift cap are next on the block. @Alan S @Calculus — See the Dan Neidel X thread I linked to above in the Saturday links. He reckons the threat to small family farms is overblown. @Calculus, I don’t know much about the taxation of farmland, but normally if you give something away you have to pay capital gains tax on the increase in value of the gift. If this applies to farmland that may make gifting difficult. CGT is not applied on death and the value of an asset is uplifted to the value at death. As there was no IHT to pay on farmland and no CGT on death, passing farmland on death may well have been more tax efficient than gifting before death. I met a farmer on Sunday night. He is of course livid. Judging by the amount of time he spends on his yacht he is clearly retired or mostly retired but still owns the farm. He did tell me that his kids have their own careers and have no interest in taking over his farm, so they would probably sell after he has gone anyway. Maybe there should have been some difference in taxation between those inheriting and subsequently running a family farm and those cashing in. I wonder whether the issue that has arisen with farming is the growth in price of the land. This has grown out of all proportion to the income that can be achieved from farming. From what I have heard some farmers say farming doesn’t seem to make much business sense. I wonder whether part of that reason was the IHT break on farming. Without that maybe land prices will fall such that yields from farming make more sense. The problem with tax incentives is that they are open to abuse. The ability to pass on pension funds free of IHT was clearly distorting pensions. I know this because I reacted to the ability to avoid IHT via pensions. AIUI, a similar thing has happened with farms. People buying in to avoid IHT. A £1 million pension buys you an annuity much lower than the average wage. A £3 million sheep farm will give you an income of ~£16K pa in Wales (half the average wage, and much lower than minimum wage). You would need to earn £50K-£70K to have the same standard of living as a family on benefits. ASSETS ARE TAXED TOO HIGHLY. THERE NEEDS TO BE A £5 million THRESHOLD ON ASSETS BEFORE ANY TAX! (Also tax ALL benefits!!!) @BBB #123 The ISA change is needed not to increase tax take today, but to ensure the future revenue stream (lost) isn’t too significant. An argument could easily be make for a much lower limit. Taking my (hopefully near future) position of around £50k pension and other income PLUS 2x£500k isa giving off 5% income – so £100k pa and £7500 tax £0 NI, Compare that to a worker earning £100k with no ISA. – roughly it’s £27k tax, £4K NI (£14k employers NI on new basis). £7.5k v £31k (or £45k inc ENI ) I’m on the right side of the fence but this is not justifiable nor reasonable. So after writing this we need merged tax and NI, and ISA limit of £200k (that doubles the state pension with no tax) #125+1 we need change and the govt needs teeth, and to use them @Simon West — Please don’t shout in CAPS on our site, cheers! The market is loving the Trump win, and the market is always right! @Boltt #132 As accumulators I wonder whether we place too much emphasis on what a good deal ISAs are. They are obviously but how many people in their earning years are fully using the £20k on top of fully funding pensions? I will have a retirement project to convert GIA to ISA (at an 18% hit) and that GIA will inflate with any TFLS I take to try to head off any future potential pension tax changes (tax at 18/24 beats tax in SIPP at 20/40 on growth anyway once LSA has been passed). Guess I just have to get used to the idea that I will be facing at least 20% tax plus the NI whammy if it happens. @TI Im not subscribed to X for the Niedel thread – if the argument is there’s ‘only’ 500 farms affected for 22/23 – thats the figure, but its out of the 1700 or so reporting for estate relief for that year. So about 30% of all farms (and rising) , not overblown ~(check out the defra survey on farm assets and net worths). https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/balance-sheet-analysis-and-farming-performance-england/balance-sheet-analysis-and-farming-performance-england-202223-statistics-notice#net-worth @Naeclue – if people are buying into farmland solely to avoid IHT at least at the smaller end, good luck – its a poor yielding asset that needs a lot of maintenance and holds a fair level of risk!

Title: Tesla, AMD And Nvidia Show Higher Volatility Than Bitcoin In October 2024
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/11/02/tesla-amd-and-nvidia-show-higher-volatility-than-bitcoin-in-october-2024/
Time Published: 2024-11-02T08:25:19Z
Full Content:
October 2024 data shows major tech stocks exceeded bitcoin's 11% volatility, with Tesla reaching ... [+] 24%, AMD 16%, and Nvidia 12%. Tesla stock topped the volatility charts at 24%, followed by AMD at 16% and Nvidia at 12%, all surpassing bitcoin's 11% movement range, according to my calculations. Other tech giants showed lower volatility than bitcoin. Intel registered 9% price swings, while Meta and Microsoft stayed around 8%. Amazon showed 7% volatility, with Google at 6%. Apple proved the most stable among analyzed stocks with just under 6% monthly volatility. This volatility distribution suggests the conventional financial narrative may need updating, as the data no longer supports the assumption that bitcoin is significantly more volatile than blue-chip tech stocks. Notably, Tesla's 24% volatility more than doubled bitcoin's 11% movement range in October 2024. Tesla, AMD, and Nvidia exhibited higher volatility than bitcoin in October 2024, while Intel, Meta, ... [+] Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Apple showed more stable price movements. Looking at maximum daily price movements, Tesla recorded the highest single-day gain at +21.92% and AMD showed the steepest drop at -10.62%, both far exceeding bitcoin's relatively modest range of +5.11% to -3.95%. Most tech stocks showed asymmetric movements with larger drops than gains, while Tesla stood out with its gain being more than twice its largest decline of -8.78%. Methodology: To test bitcoin's volatility against traditional markets, I analyzed major tech stocks with high trading volumes and media attention. I measured price swings using daily logarithmic returns in October 2024, computing their standard deviation as monthly volatility percentage. All price data was sourced from Investing.com. The October data showing bitcoin as more stable than some major tech stocks extends its long-term trend toward price stability. This shift can be attributed to several key market factors. "What we're witnessing now is bitcoin maturing as an asset, with large, stable holders and significant institutional buy-in," Mike Ermolaev, founder of Outset PR, said in an email statement. "While bitcoin isn't immune to market forces, the volatility gap between it and high-growth tech stocks is telling: bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a less speculative asset," Ermolaev explained, pointing to bitcoin ETF inflows as evidence of institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency's stability. "There is more overlap in equity and crypto traders than most realize, and that brings more similar volatility," said Mike Cagney, CEO of Figure Markets in an email statement. "As we begin to migrate to venues that feature both equity and crypto that can be cross collateralized, the two will be more correlated," he added, pointing to the increasing market integration through platforms offering cross-collateralization between both asset types. "Bitcoin's unexpected stability in October might signal its emerging role as a modern safe-haven asset," Alan Orwick, Co-Founder at Quai Network, said in an email statement. "It might just be time to question where the real value lies in an inflationary future," Orwick noted, referencing an investor Paul Tudor Jones's recent suggestion that "all roads lead to inflation" due to the U.S.'s fiscal trajectory. "It's part of what makes emerging asset classes like crypto, and even stocks like Tesla, AMD, and Nvidia, so dynamic," Dr. Tonya M. Evans, Digital Money Expert at Penn State Dickinson Law, said in an email statement. "Just as traditional finance markets settled over time, bitcoin will likely follow suit as adoption continues to grow and expand," Evans noted, suggesting that volatility should be seen as "a sign of new opportunities in an evolving financial landscape for both traditional finance and emerging digital assets markets."
