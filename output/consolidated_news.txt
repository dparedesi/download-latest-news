Aside from economic collapse scenarios, many countries are in the process of eliminating physical cash and coins. Instead, everyone has an account that holds their money. You cannot purchase goods or services without access to government-based cryptocurrency. Even if the currency itself is still backed by faith in the government, you have to use this electronic system. The result is multiple problems that could leave you in a situation where you have the money in the bank to pay your bills and purchase goods and services, yet you cannot do so. These threats include: These hacks usually affect the bank or primary clearinghouse rather than a specific person’s account. You may be unable to purchase goods or services for hours or days. While this is inconvenient, it isn’t as bad as a full collapse, where the banks close for good. There’s only so much you can do about this kind of hack other than make sure you can go two weeks without buying anything at any given time. It is also essential to keep a paper-based address book with phone numbers and account information so that you can contact utility companies or others who may be expecting payments from you while the bank or clearinghouse is down. Let’s say you can connect to Wi-Fi independently of the SIM Card. Your phone app may not work with Wi-Fi. This is why I recommend having an app on your phone that doesn’t use the SIM card to dial out on Wi-Fi so that you can make the necessary calls. If the hacker was able to steal money from your accounts, it could take weeks to years before you recover the money. In the short term, you will have to shut down credit cards and so on, then wait for new ones to come in the mail. You may also have to manage restoring devices and regaining access to your accounts. Here again, make sure you can go at least 2 weeks without buying anything so that you can manage your basic necessities. Merchant Category Codes are unique identifiers that put different products into separate categories. For example, food has one set of numeric identifiers, while clothing has other identifiers. Even without looking at your receipt, the bank and transaction clearinghouse may have some ideas about what you bought. The transaction cost can then give some estimates about quantity and item type. One day, data from all banks and clearinghouses may pool into a central government computer. Social credit scores work like your financial-based credit scores. Consider how your financial credit score enables businesses to “reward” you with credit or better interest rates if you pay your bills on time and have an optimal debt-to-income ratio. Your social credit score looks at how you act in society. For example, China has a system that rewards things like donating blood. This same system “punishes” people who drive drunk or engage in other activities that aren’t “beneficial to society.” People with good social credit scores may get tax breaks, an increased chance of getting a promotion, or other benefits. When vaccines became available for COVID-19, governments worldwide were concerned because people hesitated to embrace mRNA vaccines. This led to people not complying with recommendations to get vaccinated. Social credit scores can be paired with cashless systems that will block purchasing from specific merchant category codes. It could become possible to deny people the ability to buy food, gas, and other essentials if they aren’t vaccinated. When you can’t use cash, pressure campaigns like this will be almost 100% effective because you will have to comply or do without the necessities of life. The only way to outlast a pressure campaign like this is to have a stockpile of food and other essentials that will last until the pressure tactics are stopped. At first, you might think merchant credit codes will only come into play when the government seeks to limit, slow down, or prevent purchasing certain goods and services. The problem is that modern networks aren’t safe from hackers, including those who seek to disrupt trade for ethical reasons. For example, the Internet Archive was recently targeted by a hacktivist group, Blackmeta. They claim they attacked this non-profit library site because it is based in the USA and, therefore, is aligned with Israeli activities. Ironically, the Internet Archive has been locked in multiple court battles with publishers that may be far more aligned with Israel. These publishers, in turn, are trying to shut down the Internet Archive because when people don’t buy from the publisher, it cuts into their profits. Now imagine this kind of situation happening with the information stolen from the Heritage Foundation, and then used to target more granular data in banks and merchant clearinghouse systems. You could very easily see transactions declined for what appears to be “government” or other legislative curbs, when in fact, it’s some group attacking you because of a “social credit score” known only to them. If you want to buy something right now, you can just put your credit card away and use cash. This won’t be possible once the only fiat currency available is electronic in nature. No matter how much you want to look at the potential for excess government imposition, the fact remains any group with sufficient skills and interest can cause serious problems. AI can keep track of billions of records and patterns of activity. This includes determining if what you buy is “normal” for your location as well as for you as a consumer within a particular category. Right now, that’s likely beyond the implementation of the cashless centralized government cryptocurrency systems. At some point, though, someone on something like the “no-fly list,” etc., could wind up unable to buy certain items or in certain quantities and not realize there is a curb based on a government-based list. Considering how many lists there are, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to resolve the problem and purchase goods in a timely manner. This includes lists that may be compiled based on estimated political slant. Consider that even now, traffic cameras can match license plates with bumper stickers and yard political signs to determine your likely preferences. When you factor in non-governmental groups, the situation gets even worse. Technologically speaking, it’s within the scope of foreign agents and hacktivists to bring together limits on how you spend your money and non-financial activities. As we are seeing in various hacks, there is certainly a “social credit score” being applied to businesses that can be scaled to target individuals who may want to purchase extra supplies to manage an emergency. Right now you can protect your money while it is still in your control. First, it is very important to keep your money in different banks. Even if one goes down, the others may still be functioning. This applies to credit and debit cards. If you have only Visa cards, ensure you have at least one Mastercard. You can do this with prepaid cards as well as more permanent accounts. This method won’t work if every transaction must go through a centralized clearinghouse that includes every possible bank or other institution. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether that kind of system exists and how various groups would use or misuse it. Second, if you routinely buy from certain stores, you can purchase gift cards and have the money ready and waiting in your account. If you cannot access your bank account, you can still buy from that store. This won’t necessarily prevent you from running into rationing or other limits that may be imposed by the government through the store or at the store level. Preparing for small—and large-scale disasters is essential for your well-being and that of your family. You can still use bartering, provided you have a clear sense of the value of what you will offer and whether or not the other party needs what you have. Make consistent contacts with small or local farmers and others who may be willing to take something in exchange for food. The trade could be anything from assisting with mechanical repairs to making garments. Everything will depend on the relationship you develop and the situation. You can make barter arrangements for just about anything from tangible goods to training in various skills. Look for small businesses and local groups, as they may be more open to these kinds of arrangements. Spending a few dollars extra and supporting these people now may be very useful later on. This is also a good time to form relationships with established flea markets and others with different kinds of products. These people may be very helpful when you find a way to barter for tools or other goods that you can no longer purchase using money. Here again, you have to know what their needs are and how you can meet them. As hacks on banks, hospitals, water purification plants, and the government itself become more common, it should be obvious that a cashless society can pose significant risks if you aren’t prepared. Taking a few simple measures now may help you get through these situations as painlessly as possible. The most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! Video HERE. None of us is really looking forward to the next great depression, even while we’re all expecting it to come. The reality is that rough financial times are worrisome for everyone, including the most prepared preppers amongst us. While you and I might be better off than our neighbors are, there’s still the possibility of losing our jobs, followed by our cars and then our homes. Since one of the marks of depression is high unemployment, there’s no guarantee that any of us will manage to keep our jobs or even find another job if we lose ours. While 75% of people managed to keep their jobs back in the Great Depression of the last century, it is the 25% of them who lost their jobs that we all focus on. This shaky job market, coupled with a potential for high inflation make for a rough financial time for just about everyone. Oh, there are always those who have enough money that it doesn’t really matter; I’m not one of those people and I doubt that you are either. While we don’t know just when that next depression is going to come or what will be the actual trigger, there are plenty of things going on in the current economy to give us concern. More and more economists and financial planners of all stripes are warning people about the collapse that’s coming. Some even going so far as to say that it will be much worse than the Great Depression of the last century. So, what are we going to do when it comes? Or, perhaps even more importantly, what should we avoid doing when it comes? The first thing to realize is that the shape of the economy, including the shape of the stock market, is largely psychological. Stocks rise and fall in value due to people’s perceptions, more than anything tangible that can be pointed to. Once those people realize the mistake they’ve made, things can turn around just as quickly. It’s easy to fall into fear during times of uncertainty. But that fear will cause you to make poor decisions, just like those people trading on the stock market. While there may be plenty to be fearful about, you don’t have to fall for it, even if everyone else does. Rather, think through your situation and make the best possible decisions to protect yourself and your family. Remember, even though 25% of workers lost their jobs during the Great Depression, 75% of the people managed to keep theirs. Work on being part of that 75%. Whatever you do, don’t quit your job, no matter how bad you think it is or how much you feel they don’t appreciate you. At least you have a job and you can pay the bills. If you quit, without already having another job that you’re contracted for, you may not end up being able to get another job for months or even years. If you don’t feel that the job is meeting your financial needs, then the answer isn’t quitting, it’s reevaluating your spending and looking for a way to lower your costs. Chances are that you’re living above your means. That’s not your employer’s fault, so you can’t expect them to pay for it. With so many people losing their jobs, the one thing you want to do is make sure you keep your own. In many companies, that means becoming the indispensable person. The last one they would want to lay off. That won’t work in jobs which are controlled by unions, as all that matters then is seniority, but if that’s not an issue for the job you have, then do whatever you have to, in order to make them think that they can’t live without you. More than anything, this means going above and beyond on a regular basis. I did this in my engineering career, earning myself a number of promotions. I then passed that work ethic on to my children. When my son’s company (he works for a petroleum company) was laying people off left and right, he got a 40% raise, because they couldn’t afford to lose him. The people who have the most trouble dealing with any financial downturn are those who are saddled with a lot of debt. That can be exacerbated even more by losing a job. But even for those who manage to keep their jobs, unnecessary debt becomes a burden that’s hard to bear. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but inflation generally goes hand-in-hand with times of economic downturn. While that doesn’t mean that the cost of those debts will climb in any way, it does mean that the amount of disposable income available will shrink, leading to making some hard decisions, like paying for the new car or eating. For those who lose their jobs, all those debts make it harder to survive, financially speaking. Not only are they likely to lose whatever they bought on credit, but in trying to do everything they can to keep their heads above water, financially speaking, they might end up losing something even more important, like their home, because of that car payment. All Americans Will Lose Their Home, Income And Power By November 27, 2025 Watch the video below! Cosigning on a loan is a risky move at any time. By doing so, you’re promising to make the payment, if the borrower can’t. That puts your finances in captivity to their ability to pay their obligations. If they don’t follow the kind of advice I’m writing in this article and end up losing their job, you’re going to end up being legally forced to pay for whatever you cosigned on. During a time of financial depression, that could be enough to sink your own finances. The “Great Recession” of 2008-2009 was caused by adjustable rate and balloon mortgages. Written in the time of President Clinton’s presidency, these were intended to make it possible for people who couldn’t otherwise afford a home, the ability to buy one. The idea was sold on the basis of some financial projections that didn’t come to pass. When the interest rate or mortgage payment went up, the people who had taken out those loans found themselves unable to make their payments. It was even worse for those whose mortgages included balloon payments, as they hadn’t prepared for that huge payment. The result was that thousands of people lost their homes, pushing the nation and then the world into the recession. There’s nothing wrong with refinancing, if it can be done in such a way as to save you money. But take care when doing so, that you understand exactly what the terms of the loan are. Don’t accept something which will cause your payments to go up sometime in the future. As we’ve all seen, that’s dangerous. The last Great Depression came about largely due to people investing money they didn’t have, in stocks they didn’t understand. They were essentially buying stocks with borrowed money. That still happens today, with people “leveraging” their funds to buy more than they otherwise would be able to. The problem with that investment, like any other investment, is that it can go down, just as easily as it can go up. The “sure thing” your buddy talks you into may not be anywhere near as sure as he thinks it is. While some percentage of those really do pay off; most do not, leaving people with a sizeable loss. My personal philosophy about investing is that I see it as a gamble. As such, I won’t invest any more than I feel I can afford to lose. While I’ve missed a lot of opportunities that way, including a recent one that could have paid me 30 to 1, I haven’t lost any money that way either. Perhaps one of the more foolish things that someone can do during a depression, besides taking on new debt, is to upgrade their lifestyle. Even if you get a promotion at work, with a nice fat raise, there’s no real security that you’ll hang onto that during a time of depression. Rather than spending that money to buy a new car or a boat, use it to pay down your debt, so that later, when the economy is on steadier ground, you can afford to really enjoy it. If anything, a depression is a time to bring down your lifestyle a bit; doing everything you can to lower your expenses. That will give you more flexibility with your finances, especially if things take a turn for the worst. I know this is going to sound like a contradiction to the last item; but don’t keep your money in cash either. Rather, put it into some sort of investment that is secure; while at the same time not requiring any borrowing on your part. Assuming that you are buying at the beginning of the inflationary cycle, probably the most secure investment would be in precious metals. That isn’t the only secure investment though. Bonds, especially federal and municipal bonds are secure investments. So are utility stocks and some of the blue chip stocks. Look to invest in things that will have to exist through the depression because people need them. Those are the places to invest. My favorite investment, for people who don’t have a lot to invest, is to invest in non-perishable food. On the average, food has been going up about 8% per year, even while the general inflation rate has been hovering under 1%. So, if someone buys $1,000 worth of food and holds onto it for five years, it will be worth almost $1,500 at the end of that time. They don’t even have to sell it to cash in either; all they’ve got to do is eat it and use the money they would normally spend on that food for other things. Finally, do everything you can to avoid defrauding your creditors. There are things you can do to protect your relationship with them, even if you can’t make your payments. The last thing that any creditor wants is to have one of their customers default, causing them to repossess property. They’re not in the business of selling that property; they’re in the business of selling loans. While loan forgiveness is rather rare, you might be able to get a forbearance or deferment on that loan. Both are common for student loans and mortgage companies are amiable to working with you in that way as well. Make contact with your lender, telling them what your situation is and asking them what they can do for you. Remember, you won’t be the only one going through hard financial times. They’re probably going to be even more aware of the problems going on than you are, as they are going to have a wider picture to look at. As such, they would rather work with you, than have to go through foreclosure. The Ultra-wealthy are Planning Your Future Right Now The ultra-wealthy are planning your future right now. They’ll call it ‘utopia’ and sell it to you as such, but it’s actually the opposite. Welcome to the first of a two-part series. Utopia is a place of “ideal perfection, especially in laws, government, and social conditions.” At least, that’s the dictionary definition. The thing is, despite humans having tried for thousands of years to attain Eden-esque perfection, it’s impossible. Worse, the irony of such efforts is literally baked into the word ‘utopia:’ From Merriam Webster (emphasis added): In 1516, English humanist Sir Thomas More published a book titled Utopia, which compared social and economic conditions in Europe with those of an ideal society on an imaginary island located off the coast of the Americas. More wanted to imply that the perfect conditions on his fictional island could never really exist, so he called it “Utopia,” a name he created by combining the Greek words ou (“not, no”) and topos (“place”). Still, that doesn’t stop people from trying to create fictional paradise. The latest attempts are — unsurprisingly — conceived of, funded by, and built by our billionaire overlords, who aim to own everything and define how our lives will be lived in the future. At the same time, a paradox is unfolding. While several attempts at billionaire-initiated paradises are currently in the works, some efforts are failing, some are falling apart, and some are simply struggling to get off the ground. What we know about Silicon Valley elites, bitcoin bros, and AI billionaires is that they dream big and have virtually limitless finances. So even failed attempts at utopia — or whatever their version of it is — gets the entire cohort a step closer to decoding a formula that might stick. It’s like unlimited funding to indulge a God complex. In part one of this series, we’re looking at four concepts for creating paradise on earth crafted by the freedom loving, libertarian, optimized-living-through-technology crowd. What exactly do these communities promise? Who’s behind them? And most importantly, could they just be 15-minute dystopian wolves in utopian sheep’s clothing? Let’s dive in. Próspera began as a bold libertarian experiment on the tropical island of Roatán, off the northern coast of Honduras. It’s the brainchild of Erick Brimen, a Venezuelan-born wealth fund manager who imagined a city run not by politicians, but by market forces and blockchain logic. He’s aiming to create a low-tax, deregulated tech haven where businesses can make their own laws, or choose to implement existing national laws from a menu of 36 countries. Residents pay low taxes (payable in Bitcoin), and biotech startups push the limits of radical life extension with experimental, as yet unproven treatments disallowed in other countries. With venture capital backing from Coinbase and Sam Altman–linked projects, plus support from figures like Peter Thiel, Próspera has quickly become a magnet for crypto evangelists, longevity obsessives, and deregulation devotees. It hosts conferences with themes like: “Make death optional.” It’s creating a walled city with private arbitration courts, judges who adjudicate online from Arizona (no idea why Arizona — our research was not explicit), and QR-code entry checkpoints. But like all utopias, this charter city dream has clashed with reality. One critic called it a “libertarian fantasy… that’s not going to turn out well.” The Honduran government that initially supported the project and allowed for the zoning laws making it possible has since collapsed in scandal — with the former president serving time in US prison for conspiring to import and distribute over 400 tons of cocaine. That’s a lot of blow. Locals in the nearby village of Crawfish Rock have not taken kindly to the idea of the gated city and have accused Próspera of land grabs, environmental damage, and trying to push them out. When the current democratic socialist President, Xiomara Castro, declared the former administration’s zoning laws unconstitutional, Próspera fought back in international court, demanding nearly $11 billion USD in damages — about a third of the country’s GDP — an amount that would bankrupt the country if they lose the case. Brimen is doubling down, lobbying American politicians to argue in his favor and launching a spin-off project aimed at Africa. This all plays out as an ironic twist of history: a 21st-century version of the banana republic, complete with foreign investors, private courts, and corporate control over land, law, and labor. The term ‘banana republic’ was coined by author O. Henry to describe Honduras — a place where US fruit companies ran the economy. Now, crypto-capitalists and Silicon Valley VCs are picking up where the plantations left off, except this time, they’re promising immortality instead of bananas. NEOM was supposed to be Saudi Arabia’s leap into the future: a $500 billion high-tech oasis in the desert that would make even Silicon Valley blush. Conceived in 2017 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown jewel of his Vision 2030 plan, NEOM promised flying taxis, robot dinosaurs, artificial moons, a desert ski resort with fake snow, and a 170-kilometer mirrored city called The Line. This mirrored city was meant to stretch 170 kilometers across the desert with no cars, no roads, and no emissions — just smart infrastructure, biometric surveillance, and those previously mentioned flying taxis. But like many utopias, the fantasy is already buckling under the weight of reality. The goal was for The Line to eventually be home to 9 million people, with 1.5 million residents by 2030. Middle East Eye reports that Saudi officials now predict fewer than 300,000 in that time frame. Only 2.4 kilometers of The Line may actually be completed by 2030. Oil revenues — the main funding source — have declined sharply, and insiders say the kingdom is facing an “environment of limited resources.” Budget reviews are underway, and other NEOM projects (like the year-round ski resort) have been shelved, delayed, or drastically scaled back. Behind the glossy renderings lies a construction project with a dystopian work culture. NEOM’s former CEO, Nadhmi al-Nasr, developed a reputation for abusive management. “I drive everybody like a slave,” he said, celebrating “[w]hen they drop down dead… That’s how I do my projects.” In one case, he told an employee to “walk into the desert and die” so he could urinate on their grave. As a result, there has been a mass exodus of foreign executives, many of whom forfeited six-figure contracts just to escape the toxic environment. Meanwhile, members of the Howeitat tribe, native to the land NEOM occupies, have resisted the development. Many have been forcibly removed, at least one activist was killed, and others have been imprisoned for resisting eviction. Human rights groups have condemned the project, while NEOM’s own consultants warned that the mega-structure could actually change the weather and decimate bird populations due to its massive mirrored walls. None of this matters; Saudi officials press on. Promotional videos still promise a gleaming future where “Neomians” live in harmony with nature, technology, and robot dinosaurs. But those on the ground tell a different story — of constant surveillance, sexual harassment allegations ignored by leadership, and Orwellian control over employee life. Promises of a liberalized social zone — with alcohol, gender mixing, freedom — have quietly been walked back by a government known for its public stonings and other extreme punishment for ‘immorality.’ NEOM may, in fact, never turn out to be the future of urban life. But it may just be the world’s most expensive monument to authoritarian delusion: a dystopian nightmare of a city built on sand, surveillance, and slogans. Telosa is what happens when a billionaire tries to build a utopian city without using the word ‘utopia.’ Marc Lore, former Walmart executive and founder of Jet.com and Diapers.com, envisions a new city rising from scratch somewhere in the American desert (or possibly Appalachia), designed to be sustainable, walkable, tech-forward, and just equitable enough to keep you from asking too many questions. According to Telosa’s website, this categorically, definitely, 100 percent isn’t a utopia. Is the goal to create a utopia? No, we are absolutely not attempting to create a utopia. Utopian projects are focused on creating a perfect, idealistic state — we are not. We are firmly grounded in reality and what is possible. We are focused on the best, most sustainable solutions for infrastructure, urban design, economic vibrancy and city services, but we fully recognize that no solution is perfect and all human systems have flaws. Therefore, we are committed to new ideas, finding the best way to solve difficult problems and constant improvement. And yet the renderings and promo videos suggest otherwise: gleaming towers, shaded plazas, handicap-accessible courtyards, and monorails slicing silently through eco-optimized zones. If it looks like utopia, smells like utopia, and plans to engineer human behavior like utopia — well, you do the math. The project is called “Telosa,” from the Greek word telos — meaning “highest purpose.” Hey — stop calling it utopia! The big idea is for 50,000 people to move to this yet-to-be-determined place by 2030 and have the population eventually grow to 5 million. Everyone lives within a short walk (15 minutes maybe?) of everything they need — a school, a park, a job (lolz!), and probably an AI wellness coach. Cars, of course, are banned. There will be solar-powered towers and vertical farms and an economy based on “equitism,” a remix of a 19th-century idea where the city itself owns the land and uses rising property values to fund social services. But for all its lofty ideas, Telosa has yet to put a single shovel in the ground. There’s no final site, no government approval, and no clear funding beyond Lore’s initial push. It’s still just a shimmering concept, a mirage sketched by a star architect (Bjarke Ingels) and floated in interviews, TED talks, and design expos. Critics argue that if Lore really wanted to help people, he could invest in solving infrastructure problems in existing cities. Others point out that “15-minute cities” — the model Telosa clearly mirrors — have become a global flashpoint, praised by urban planners but derided by skeptics as a way to centralize control, limit movement, and monitor citizens. So far, Telosa’s biggest achievement is that it’s really good at marketing a city that doesn’t exist. If it ever does gets built, we may finally get to ask: does a billionaire-designed city really offer freedom — or just the illusion of choice in a world where the architecture has already made the decisions for you? If you’ve ever dreamed of escaping taxes, regulations, and society itself, there’s a billionaire-funded plan for that: Seasteading — the floating libertarian fantasy that just won’t sink, no matter how many times it fails. First floated (literally and ideologically) by the Seasteading Institute in 2008, the project was originally funded by… wait for it… Peter Thiel. He envisioned self-governing cities bobbing peacefully in international waters until backing away from the idea and stating they were “not quite feasible from an engineering perspective.” The concept was a nation without a nation, where entrepreneurs could escape pesky things like labor laws, zoning, and democracy. In short: Silicon Valley meets Waterworld, minus the humility. An initial prototype near Thailand ended with Thai authorities raiding the floating platform and accusing the residents of endangering national sovereignty, an offense punishable by life imprisonment or death. The couple that lived on the house boat went into hiding and the Thai navy eventually hauled away what was essentially a raft with Wi-Fi. The broader Seasteading movement has since splintered, evolved, and — most recently — mutated into a newer project with fresher branding: Arkpad. “By building a community in the ocean, you’re not just creating a home; you’re crafting a legacy of innovation, freedom, and sustainability,” reads the marketing copy. Arkpad bills itself as a “sovereign lifestyle project” and a “network state” — crypto-native language for the same old dream: private governance, no taxes, total control. Based in the Philippines, Arkpad is aiming to build on ocean-based platforms and create a floating community, complete with decentralized ID systems, underwater real estate, and NFTs for residency. Because, of course. Their YouTube channel mixes crypto sermons with dreamy renderings of sleek structures rising from the sea — modern-day Noah’s Arks, minus the animals or flood, but heavy on Bitcoin and barnacles. Watch the videos carefully and you’ll see the architects’ sleek computer-generated renderings blur into the reality of what an Arkpad really is: a concrete block floating in the middle of absolutely nowhere. No word on whether they supply residents with free Dramamine. Just like Seasteading before it, Arkpad suffers from a chronic case of reality avoidance. Engineering constraints, rising ocean temperatures, maritime law, international sovereignty, and basic logistical challenges all still exist. What’s more, these projects have always been less about freedom for all and more about escape for the few. Not everyone is invited to these floating utopias. They’re luxury lifeboats for a digital elite preparing to sail away from the consequences of the world they helped wreck. Until further notice, Seasteading and Arkpad remain what they’ve always been: libertarian lighthouses in the fog — glowing ideals with no mooring in the real world. Whether real or imagined, all these utopian concepts promise clean slates and high-tech harmony in their own way, plugged into the seductive guarantee of a new way to live. Blockchain ruled and perfect in efficiency, there remains only one slight problem: Reality. History shows that when elites indulge in the fantasy of utopias, reality always gets in the way. Wealthy eccentricity is tolerable for a small group of like-minded disciples, but humans are not robots. Therefore, it’s unlikely that a utopia cooked up by some micro-dosing, immortality-seeking tech bro could ever be scaled up except through heavy reliance on surveillance, coercion, and control — where things eventually devolve into socially engineered, privacy-erasing digital prisons, wrapped in glossy marketing brochures and eco-communal delusion. There’s also the problem of governments — they’re not into the whole competition thing. But hey, that’s not going to stop these billionaires from trying. So in part two of this series, we’ll look at some of the other ways billionaires are planning to control the future of urban living and how it might affect you. At the top of the financial pyramid sits the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland , the “central bank of central banks.” It acts as a clearinghouse for financial operations between major nations and secretly controls monetary policy for over 60 central banks worldwide.They operate with complete legal immunity from national governments and taxation. Central banks themselves , like the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and others , print fiat currency at will, control interest rates, and manipulate economic conditions to serve the interests of the elite, not the public. Names like: These families accumulated obscene amounts of wealth through monopolies on banking, oil, railroads, and shipping during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries , and much of that wealth was quietly transitioned into trusts, holding companies, and offshore accounts. Estimates of the Rothschild family’s total wealth range from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars, though it’s nearly impossible to trace because it’s hidden in foundations, trusts, and behind nominal ownership. According to a study by the Tax Justice Network, the global elite hide $21 to $32 trillion in offshore accounts , in places like: This hoarded wealth escapes taxation, public scrutiny, and accountability. The U.S. government alone has been caught “losing track” of trillions: A handful of investment firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, now collectively own controlling stakes in: They also control massive real estate portfolios , quietly buying up farmland, housing, and critical infrastructure worldwide. The Vatican Bank holds untold billions in gold, real estate, and art. Documents have shown it profited from wars, colonial plundering, and financial schemes. Rumors persist about secret underground vaults loaded with treasures taken during centuries of conquest and conflict. Because it’s not idle money — it’s used to: And while the average person struggles with inflation, debt, and taxes , these entities hoard enough wealth to end global poverty dozens of times over. The idea of a global elite controlling humanity through debt, manipulation, and hoarded wealth isn’t a theory. It’s a fact that history’s empires have always functioned this way. The names and technology have changed, but the strategy hasn’t. And when the people finally see how it works, it falls apart. Every time. Since the 2008 crisis, four huge shifts take place that define the modern financial industry: Due to the strict regulatory policy adopted after the crisis, the post-2008 banking sector was uncompetitive relative to the pre-2008 banking sector, with the aggravating circumstance that the banks that survived the crash were buried in debt and deeply exposed in regards to their internal control mechanisms. In this context, the industrial sector sought for alternative, non-bank financing methods; namely private equity and alternative credit, with the latter occupying the power vacuum left by old-fashioned moneylenders that had been wounded by the housing market crash and the former constituting a revolutionary way of investing in company stock. Attention: The US is Facing The BIGGEST Threat Of The Century So pay chose attention because this video will change your life forever for the good! The most iconic finance job ever, the stockbroker, pretty much suffered its extinction during the 2008 crash. This opened the door for automated forms of investing in which the role of the intermediary – the broker – became trivial. Instead of investing on specific companies due to shareholder expectations of growth and performance, investors shifted towards large diversified funds listing hundreds of companies and tracking their growth over long periods of time. The vast majority of portfolios rarely list individual company stock anymore; instead you’ll find passive investments on the S&P 500 or similar indexes. The pre-2008 get-rich-quick culture came to an end long ago, with the exception of online quasi-scams and compulsive gamblers stepping out of casinos and into the stock market. Nowadays, equity investments are much more sober, striving for low returns on the short term, but large gains in the long run due to compound interest. This focus on long-term wealth planning is but a consequence of the overall lack of confidence in the solvency public pension plans – a very reasonable public sentiment that has grown especially amongst young generations and that has pushed them to rely on private retirement systems. While fee compression already democratized the access to the stock market, small investors were still excluded from alternative investments such as private equity and venture capital. With the rise of alternative credit (as detailed in point 1) private equity funds did not only lower their minimum capital requirements, but we also witnessed the appearance of “feeder funds” aimed at collecting cash from small investors in order to meet the capital requirements of actual private equity funds. In occasions, markets have even experienced feeder funds of feeder funds, or feeder funds creating ETF-like portfolios combining investments on several private equity funds, such as EQT. The financial sector is arguably a more mature sector due to developments taking place since the 2008 crisis. This is mainly due to automatization of middleman roles and thence a democratization of access to investment opportunities, a soberized portfolio management culture, the rise of non-bank financing methods, and a declining confidence in public pension plans. The Medical Research Scam (The most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times) First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE In the universe of alternative media, the immense size and influence of the Science/Medicine Industrial Complex (including “Big Pharma”) is well-known and commonly accepted. However, this massive network of organizations might be better understood as Big Research. A recent investigation dealing with UAB football (too embarrassing to cancel) led me to perform further research into the key source of funding for this university, the largest employer in the state of Alabama. The revenue UAB derives from scientific “research grants” awarded by the federal government is of a scale that boggles the mind of this citizen researcher. This examination of UAB funding sources should illustrate the massive amounts of money flowing from Washington D.C. – as well as various other medical foundations and private sources – into the coffers of certain higher education institutions that have leveraged allocations labeled “scientific research” into money-printing factories. In the past seven years, UAB – a public college of 23,000 students and 24,000 (!) employees – generated at least $5 billion in revenue from government grants, most coming from the federal government and most from grants bestowed by the National institutes of Health (NIH). In Fiscal Year 2022, UAB was the recipient of a “record” $774.5 million in federal grants and funding (source: al.com Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist John Archibald). You’ll Understand Everything After Watching This VIDEO! From 2018 through 2022, UAB received $3.178 billion in science research grants. Assuming annual funding levels were similar in 2023, 2024 and 2025, UAB has pocketed more than $5 billion in “research” money. According to an analysis published by the The Urban Institute in 2022, 37 percent of UAB’s operating revenues came from federal funding. Only two colleges in America – MIT (48 percent) and Johns Hopkins (42 percent) – received a larger percentage of their total income from the federal government. For context, every year UAB makes approximately twice the amount of revenue from federal grants as the university does from student tuition and fees. According to the school’s financial report from 2020, the school netted $244.93 million in tuition and fees in Fiscal 2020 and $484 million from “grants and contracts.” (Even tuition is federally subsidized, as nation-wide, 31.6 percent of students receive Pell Grants. I also learned that graduate students who help perform medical research are paid with federal dollars.) In 2022, UAB received $774 million in federal funding, more than double the $332.4 million it received as a legislative approproriation from the State of Alabama. The vast majority of UAB’s federal funding comes from the NIH, the parent agency of the NIAID, the sub-agency headed by Anthony Fauci through 2023. According to various sources, UAB received $413 million from the NIH in 2023 and $407 million in 2022. Indeed, the Alabama college is in the “top 1 percent” of colleges that receive grants from this agency. Also, the NIH is not the only “public health agency” that showers money on UAB. The same year the college received more than $20 million from the CDC and $11.5 million from the National Science Foundation. The college also benefits from “private grants and contracts,” which presumably come from “partners” in Big Pharma like Pfizer, NGOs and various foundations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, the University received $81.2 million from “private” grants, according to the 2020 CPA financial report. The school also derives income from patents and royalties on drugs and vaccines its faculty helped create. According to a UAB press release, “other growth areas include industry and clinical trials. Total industry awards, which include grants, funded trials and services, more than doubled (106 percent) since 2018 to exceed $150 million in 2022.” For further context, the amount of revenue UAB derives every year from federal funding and federal grants is at least $550 million more than the entire operating budget of Jacksonville State University, a four-year Alabama college with approximately 9,000 students. According to a Google AI query, 88 percent of the “medical research money” distributed to Alabama’s 34 four-year colleges went to just one university – UAB. The justification for the vast amounts of “research money” flowing into UAB coffers is that these investments “save lives” and improve the health of Alabamians and Americans. Indeed, earlier this year, an RFK, Jr. initiative at the HHS threatened to make “huge cuts to biomedical research grants” distributed to “research colleges” like UAB. According al.com columnist John Archibald, “several (UAB) professors and doctors privately were close to panic … wondering if they should pack their bags.” According to the all-important authorized narrative, possible cuts in medical research would result in horrific spikes in future deaths and unfathomable medical misery. To emphasize the requisite scare-mongering point, Archibald quoted Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. “…You’re either pro-Alabamian and American health or you’re not,” said Mayor Woodfin. “There’s no in-between here. And when you cut funding, you hurt not just employers, but you hurt the people who voted for you as it relates to the ability for life-saving medicine, period.” In one column, Archibald urged Alabama Republican senator Katie Britt to fight to protect “life-saving research” being conducted at UAB. Not surprisingly, Britt did just this, writing a letter to President Trump to “speed up the release of NIH funds to UAB.” According to Sen. Britt’s spokesperson Grace Evans: “Senator Britt has been a strong advocate for ensuring the NIH remains the gold-standard of research and innovation across the nation and the world. She has continued to express the need for taxpayer dollars … which includes funding life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.” According to Sen. Britt’s letter, “withholding or delaying these funds could undermine critical research; risk jobs supported by scientific research and delay Americans’ access to life-saving treatments.” Watch this video below to find out the great secrets hidden by the government. As a jaded, skeptical contrarian, I’m happy to challenge the entire “life-saving research” narrative. For starters, it should be noted for the record that every phD and medical researcher at UAB (like all “research” universities) was spectacularly wrong about Covid and the Covid response, including the necessity for “life-saving” vaccines. I recently published an article about a UAB faculty member who spent 400 words in a guest column telling citizens the novel coronavirus was largely spread from physical surfaces. My long-time readers also know that Anthony Fauci’s successor at the NIAID was Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, who graduated to this job after serving for years as the director of UAB’s highly-acclaimed Infectious Disease Department. While a revered and honored Birmingham resident, Dr. Marrazzo, like 99.9 percent of higher education experts, was wrong about everything Covid. Furthermore, she helped lead the safety trials for remdesivir (nicknamed “Run, Death is Near!”), a formerly FDA-rejected drug which was “researched” and “developed” by UAB and the NIH. According to many contrarians and ignored hospital whistleblowers, this “ground-breaking, life-saving” Covid “treatment” has killed thousands of American citizens. (One of UAB’s grants – for $37.5 million – was awarded to administer safety trials for this life-taking drug.) In researching this story, I found an article about another esteemed UAB faculty expert, Dr. Paul Goepfert, a “UAB vaccine expert.” In November 2020, Yellowhammer News ran a big story on this vaccine expert after Pfizer (a regular benefactor of UAB), reported its vaccine was “90 percent effective.” “That’s tremendous news,’ said Dr. Goepfert. “… The most optimistic of us were thinking about 70% effective, so 90% effectiveness is fantastic.” Goepfert advised … “if the Pfizer vaccine is indeed 90% effective, around 60% of the population would need to take the vaccine to achieve herd immunity.” Applying “follow-up journalism” to Yellow Hammer News’ glowing report, at least 60 percent of the population did get two doses of these “vaccines” and “herd immunity” did not happen. In fact, the vaccinated become much more likely to be infected once, twice or four times than the unvaccinated. When I think about the hundreds of billions of dollars distributed to research colleges like UAB, the conclusion I reach is that most of this money is being spent to develop new pills and new vaccines to treat medical conditions that aren’t getting better. Per my analysis, researchers identify a medical issue that’s allegedly causing a terrible medical condition, followed by Big Pharma rushing in to create and sell a new pill, which patients will have to take the rest of their lives. For example, researchers discovered that “high cholesterol” was the major risk factor for heart attacks and sold billions of Statins. (Also, the numeric definer of “high cholesterol” was steadily lowered). The same thing happened with blood pressure medications and anti-depressants, which half of the country now takes (including large percentages of teenagers, especially female teenagers). The nightmare depression risk is suicide, but the number of suicides have increased, perhaps because anti-depressants increase the risk of suicide. Colonoscopies – like breast cancer screenings – were supposed to be a life saver but all that happened is researchers encouraged citizens to start getting annual colonoscopies and mammograms at earlier points in their lives (when it comes to colonoscopies, “45 is the new 55.”) Like many research universities, UAB features an academic department devoted just to fighting infectious diseases. However, infectious diseases don’t show up on any Top 10 or Top 15 list of “leading causes of death.” Researchers tell us vaccines eliminated deaths from infectious diseases like chicken pox, measles and polio, but those death and illness numbers essentially vanished because of better sanitation. UAB is also famed for its cancer research. While the “war on cancer” has been waged my entire life, cancer deaths and diagnosis are higher than they’ve ever been. *** IMO, it’s entirely possible the vast Medical Research Complex has caused a net increase in deaths due to over-prescriptions and over vaccination. If the “research” is bad or dubious, the public would have been better off with no “ground-breaking, life-saving solutions” …all brought to the public by the army of scientists performing studies and experiments in NIH-funded laboratories. For those who think these comments are medical disinformation or blaspheme, my rejoinder is … try selling these “solutions” to the Amish, who don’t receive any of these shots or take any of these pills … and who are living to a ripe, healthy old age. As a final editorial point on the alleged importance of cutting-edge medical research, the world needs more contrarians who ask questions about all of the medical research that doesn’t take place at these universities. As this article documents, just one university in Alabama has received more than $5 billion in research grants and contracts in a few years. However, not one research dollar has been allocated to research the embalmers’ clots. No “ground-breaking, life-saving” research has told the public what’s causing these white, fibrous clots in tens of millions of people and what might stop them. Nor is UAB investigating or researching the source of the spike in cancer diagnoses or “turbo cancers.” If a prize was awarded for the most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times, it might be named in honor of Anthony Fauci, John D. Rockefeller or Bill Gates … and the Medical Research Complex would win this trophy every year. Lessons from the Economic Catastrophe of 1929 (Bank Failures Played a Crucial Role in Deepening the Economic Crisis) The Great Depression of 1929 stands as one of the most significant economic crises in modern history, casting a long shadow over the global financial landscape. Sparked by a catastrophic stock market crash in October, this era of intense economic turmoil led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest. In the United States, millions lost their jobs, homes, and savings, forcing families to confront an uncertain and often dire future. This article delves into the factors that precipitated the Great Depression, its profound impact on American society, the government responses that shaped economic policy, and the global ramifications of this devastating crisis. By understanding these aspects, we can glean valuable lessons that inform current economic practices and prepare us for future economic challenges. Watch the video below! The Great Depression did not arise in a vacuum; it was the result of a confluence of several factors that had been brewing throughout the 1920s. To fully understand the causes of the Great Depression, it is essential to look at the economic environment of the 1920s, commonly referred to as the “Roaring Twenties.” This period was marked by significant economic growth, technological advances, and an unprecedented rise in consumer culture. However, this prosperity was built on shaky foundations, and cracks were starting to appear. One of the primary catalysts for the Great Depression was the rampant speculation in the stock market. During the late 1920s, an increasing number of Americans began investing in stocks, often borrowing money to purchase shares in hopes of quick profit. This speculative bubble was characterized by inflated stock prices that did not reflect the actual value of the companies. The euphoria surrounding stock investments created an unsustainable market driven by the belief that prices would continue to rise indefinitely. Unfortunately, this led to an inevitable collapse when the bubble burst in October 1929, resulting in a dramatic stock market crash that sent shockwaves throughout the economy. Bank failures also played a crucial role in deepening the economic crisis. With the collapse of the stock market, many banks faced immense financial pressure as their clients rushed to withdraw their savings, fearing for their financial security. The banking system, which had become over-leveraged during the boom years, was unable to withstand the sudden surge of withdrawals. By 1933, approximately 9,000 banks had failed, wiping out billions in savings and further destabilizing the economy. The loss of confidence in the banking system exacerbated the financial crisis, leaving consumers with little access to credit and diminishing their ability to spend, which in turn led to decreased production and even more layoffs. International trade issues also contributed to the economic downturn. In an attempt to protect American industries, the U.S. government enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930, which raised tariffs on hundreds of imported goods. Although the intention was to bolster the domestic economy, the result was a significant decrease in international trade. Other nations retaliated by imposing tariffs on American goods, leading to a cascading effect of reduced trade volumes and increased economic isolationism. The combination of these protective measures further deepened the global economic crisis, proving counterproductive to the very goals they sought to achieve. Additionally, economic disparities and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few created an unstable economic environment. While the upper echelons of society reaped the benefits of the booming economy, a significant portion of the population struggled to make ends meet. This disparity in wealth led to reduced consumer spending, which is a vital component for economic growth. Without a robust consumer base, businesses struggled to maintain production levels, leading to layoffs and further economic contraction. In summary, the causes of the Great Depression were multifaceted and interconnected. The speculative practices of the stock market, bank failures, international trade barriers, and growing economic inequality all played significant roles in leading the world into one of its darkest economic periods. By examining these causes, we can draw lessons not only about financial prudence but also about the importance of a balanced economic system that supports all citizens, rather than a select few. The ramifications of the Great Depression extended far beyond economic collapse; they reshaped the social fabric of the United States. As unemployment soared, many families faced dire financial straits. By 1933, unemployment rates had skyrocketed to approximately 25%, leaving millions of Americans without jobs and many more struggling to survive on meager means. This widespread financial despair led to significant social challenges, including increased rates of homelessness, malnutrition, and mental health issues. The plight of the unemployed was visible in cities and towns across the nation. Shantytowns, often referred to as “Hoovervilles” after President Herbert Hoover, sprang up as displaced families sought shelter in makeshift huts. These communities became symbols of the suffering and hardship endured during this era. Families often found themselves living in extreme poverty, with many children going hungry or forced to drop out of school to support their families. The loss of a stable home environment had long-lasting effects on the health and education of these children, many of whom would experience generational poverty as a result. Furthermore, the Great Depression had a profound effect on the American psyche. The sense of insecurity and hopelessness permeated society, as people grappled with the loss of their dreams and aspirations. The stress of financial instability contributed to a rise in mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Families were torn apart by financial difficulties, with some individuals resorting to desperate measures, including theft or begging. The collective trauma experienced during this period would leave scars that echoed throughout psychological studies and societal dynamics in subsequent decades. Social movements also began to emerge in response to the crises created by the Great Depression. Workers organized strikes and protests, demanding fair wages and better working conditions. Labor unions became more prominent as workers sought to protect their rights in an increasingly volatile job market. For many, invoking the power of collective bargaining became a means of survival. This surge in labor activism ultimately contributed to significant changes in labor laws and workers’ rights in the years that followed. The Great Depression also prompted shifts in public attitudes toward government intervention in the economy. Prior to this period, many believed in a laissez-faire approach, where the government primarily took a hands-off stance regarding economic affairs. However, the scale of the crisis led many to advocate for a more active role for the government in providing support for those in need. This shift in public opinion laid the groundwork for future social safety nets and government programs that aimed to assist those facing economic hardship. In conclusion, the impact of the Great Depression on society was profound and multifaceted. The economic collapse not only led to widespread unemployment and poverty but also altered the way individuals viewed work, government, and their place within society. The lessons learned during this tumultuous time continue to resonate today, emphasizing the importance of social safety nets, economic equality, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! In the wake of the Great Depression, the U.S. government faced intense pressure to respond to the profound economic crisis that had gripped the nation. Under the leadership of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in March 1933, the government implemented a series of sweeping reforms and policies collectively known as the New Deal. These initiatives aimed to provide immediate relief to the unemployed, to stimulate economic recovery, and to implement lasting reforms to prevent future economic collapses. One of the cornerstone programs of the New Deal was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), established in 1933. This program aimed to provide jobs for young men while simultaneously addressing environmental conservation efforts. Participants in the CCC worked on projects ranging from reforestation to building parks and trails, enabling them to support their families while also contributing to national recovery efforts. By the time the program came to an end, millions of young men had benefited from the CCC, gaining work experience and developing skills that would serve them for a lifetime. Another critical aspect of the New Deal was the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA), which aimed to stimulate the economy by investing in large-scale public works projects. The PWA funded the construction of infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and bridges, creating jobs for thousands and laying the groundwork for future economic growth. These projects not only provided immediate employment but also contributed to long-term improvements in public services and infrastructure. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) was also established to provide financial assistance to states for direct relief programs. This initiative allowed states to distribute funds to those most in need, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations received support in a timely manner. FERA marked a significant shift in government policy toward direct intervention in alleviating poverty and provided a model for future entitlement programs. In addition to these relief programs, the New Deal included regulatory reforms aimed at stabilizing the financial system. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated commercial banking from investment banking, creating a barrier to limit risky financial practices that had contributed to the economic collapse. The establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought to regulate the stock market and protect investors from fraudulent practices, restoring public confidence in the financial system. Furthermore, the New Deal brought about reforms in labor rights with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) in 1935. This legislation guaranteed the rights of workers to organize, join unions, and engage in collective bargaining. This marked a significant shift in labor relations, as it provided a legal framework for workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions. The act resulted in a surge of union membership and empowered workers in their fight for labor rights. The New Deal also included social welfare programs, such as the Social Security Act of 1935, which established a social safety net for the elderly, unemployed, and disabled. By providing financial support to vulnerable populations, the Social Security Act marked a significant transformation in the government’s role in economic security, providing a foundation for the modern welfare state. While the New Deal faced criticism from various quarters, including conservative politicians and those who argued it expanded government power too far, the overall response to the Great Depression reflected a paradigm shift in how the government perceived its role in the economy. The efforts initiated under the New Deal laid the foundation for a more interventionist government and contributed to the eventual recovery from the Great Depression. In conclusion, the government’s response to the Great Depression through the New Deal was multifaceted and transformative. Through a series of innovative programs and policies, the government sought to address the immediate needs of a struggling population while implementing reforms to safeguard against future economic crises. The legacy of the New Deal continues to shape discussions around economic policy and the role of government intervention, highlighting the importance of adaptable responses in times of crisis. The Great Depression was not confined to the United States; its effects resonated around the globe, reshaping economies, societies, and international relations. As countries struggled with the fallout from the economic crisis, they faced unique challenges that often led to varying responses and policies. In Europe, the Great Depression had a devastating impact on economies already teetering on the brink following the devastation of World War I. Nations like Germany, which were grappling with the reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, experienced severe economic distress. Hyperinflation, massive unemployment, and social unrest became commonplace as economic instability eroded confidence in democratic governments. The dire economic circumstances contributed to the rise of extremist political movements, most notably the ascent of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Hitler’s regime leveraged the economic despair to promote its agenda, which included aggressive nationalism and expansionist policies. In the United Kingdom, the depression catalyzed significant political and economic changes. While initially, the British government adopted a hands-off approach, the rising levels of unemployment and growing public discontent eventually compelled leaders to take action. The Labour Party, which gained power in the 1929 elections, aimed to address the crisis through public works programs and unemployment relief. However, the severity of the depression led to the eventual formation of a National Government coalition in 1931, prioritizing economic recovery over socialist reforms and implementing austerity measures that included cuts to public spending. Countries in Latin America experienced backlash as well, particularly in relation to global trade patterns. Many nations were heavily reliant on exports of agricultural products, which suffered from the drop in demand during the depression. This economic hardship led to political instability, with some countries experiencing military coups as leaders exploited the social and economic unrest. For example, in Brazil, Getúlio Vargas rose to power in 1930 amid the tumult and initiated sweeping reforms to promote industrialization, which were partially in response to the weaknesses exposed by the Great Depression. In response to the economic calamity, some nations adopted increasingly protectionist policies, including high tariffs and import quotas. This drive for economic self-sufficiency often stifled international cooperation and trade, leading to an era of economic isolationism. Protectionism, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in the United States, not only exacerbated domestic economic problems but also fueled tensions between nations as retaliatory measures took hold. While the depression compelled some nations to pursue isolationist policies, it also drove others to collaborate on economic recovery efforts. The establishment of agreements like the London Economic Conference in 1933 reflected the recognition of the need for coordinated international action to combat the crisis. Unfortunately, the conference failed to produce meaningful results as countries prioritized their national interests over global cooperation. The global consequences of the Great Depression also led to significant shifts in economic thought. Many countries began to explore Keynesian economic principles, which advocated for increased government intervention to stimulate demand during economic downturns. John Maynard Keynes, an influential economist, argued that governments should increase spending during periods of recession to boost consumption and promote recovery, contradicting prevailing economic philosophies that emphasized balanced budgets and limited government involvement. In summary, the Great Depression reverberated across the globe, resulting in significant economic, political, and social fallout. While some nations descended into turmoil, others sought to rebuild and adapt in response to the crisis. The diverse responses to the Great Depression underscored the interconnectedness of the world economy and highlighted the importance of international cooperation in addressing complex challenges—a lesson that continues to resonate in current global economic discussions. The Great Depression left an indelible mark on economic policy and societal norms, shaping the way governments and institutions approach economic challenges to this day. Several lessons can be gleaned from this tumultuous period, providing valuable insights for contemporary policymakers and economists. One of the most critical lessons is the importance of timely and effective government intervention in times of economic crisis. The initial laissez-faire approach taken during the early stages of the Great Depression led to a catastrophic decline in economic conditions and widespread suffering. The eventual recognition of the need for government action—exemplified by the New Deal—demonstrated that proactive measures could mitigate the consequences of an economic downturn and support recovery efforts. Today, many governments recognize the necessity of employing fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate the economy during recessions, showing the enduring influence of lessons learned from the Great Depression. Another vital takeaway is the need for strong regulatory frameworks to maintain financial stability. The lack of oversight in the financial sector contributed significantly to the events leading up to the Great Depression, resulting in risky practices and rampant speculation. In the aftermath, reforms such as the Glass-Steagall Act and the establishment of regulatory bodies like the SEC were implemented to stabilize the financial system. Modern economies continue to grapple with the balance between regulation and free-market principles, underscoring the importance of a robust regulatory framework to safeguard against financial crises. The Great Depression also highlighted the dangers of economic inequality. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals contributed to volatility and limited the purchasing power of the broader population. Economists and policymakers today increasingly recognize that equitable economic growth benefits society as a whole and contributes to overall stability. Ensuring that wealth is distributed more evenly can create a more resilient economy, capable of withstanding fluctuations and crises. Furthermore, the importance of social safety nets became apparent during the Great Depression. As millions suffered from unemployment and poverty, the need for government-supported programs to assist vulnerable populations became clear. Modern social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance and food assistance programs, are grounded in the lessons learned from this historical event. These programs are critical to providing a measure of economic security and stability in times of hardship, ensuring that individuals and families are not left to navigate crises alone. Lastly, the Great Depression emphasized the interconnectedness of global economies. The ripple effects of the economic collapse demonstrated that no nation operates in isolation. Today’s policymakers must consider the impact of global trade, investment, and economic policies, understanding that collaboration and dialogue across nations are necessary to prevent similar crises from arising. Organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have emerged in part to facilitate international cooperation and provide support to countries facing economic challenges. In conclusion, the lasting lessons of the Great Depression continue to shape economic thought and policy today. The undeniable impact of government intervention, the necessity of regulatory frameworks, the importance of addressing economic inequality, the need for social safety nets, and the recognition of global interconnectedness are all crucial insights drawn from this period of crisis. As economies face new challenges in the 21st century, these lessons remain relevant, guiding policymakers to foster resilience and stability in the face of economic uncertainty. The Great Depression of 1929 serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of economic systems and the profound impact of financial crises on society. The confluence of factors that led to this catastrophic event, including stock market speculation, bank failures, and economic inequality, created a perfect storm that devastated millions of lives. The social, economic, and political repercussions of the Great Depression reshaped the American landscape, paving the way for government intervention and regulatory reforms that continue to influence economic policy today. From the establishment of the New Deal programs to the global responses that shape modern economic thought, the lessons learned during the Great Depression are invaluable. The importance of timely governmental intervention, the need for robust regulatory frameworks, the significance of addressing economic inequality, and the necessity of social safety nets cannot be overstated. Furthermore, the crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of the global economy, underscoring the importance of collaboration and communication among nations. As we navigate the complexities of today’s economic landscape, drawing on the experiences of the past can inform our approach to future crises. The resilience of societies in the face of adversity, coupled with the commitment to enacting meaningful reforms, can contribute to a more stable and equitable economic environment. The Great Depression reminds us that while economic challenges may arise, our responses can lay the groundwork for a more sustainable future for generations to come. This Shocking Video Will Completely Change Our World First Major Risks of a Cashless Society (New Update) According to- discoveryalert.com.au: The push for a cashless society represents more than just technological evolution—it’s a coordinated effort occurring at multiple levels of government, financial institutions, and corporations worldwide. This transition is reshaping how we interact with money and raising significant questions about financial freedom and privacy. The cashless society is a necessary step in preparation for the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast, btw, is a concept based on a couple of short passages from The Revelation (end of chapter 13 and start of chapter 14), which say that there will eventually be a one world government just before Jesus returns, and the spiritual leader of that government will cause people everywhere to get a mark put in their right hand or in their forehead, without which they will not be able to buy or sell. What we have used for centuries for buying and selling is cash (or checks). We have also progressed to credit cards. So all of these would need to be replaced with the mark, in order for the prophecy to come true. Is cashless society in World a bad step? Cashless Means Automatic If money is easy to spend, it is also easy to take. Convenience can easily become tyranny. Automatic payments that come directly from your bank account illustrate the point.) The convenience of digital money that allows you to spend your money more easily, also makes it easier for banks, governments and thieves to take it.The message to depositors is clear- when you put money in a bank you are a creditor of the bank and if it goes bust you are at the bottom of the list of creditors. Your money** will be seized as part of any approved plan, perhaps even before the broke bank files for bankruptcy. Your bank account can be raided by government authorities, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) without notice or reason given. If the IRS believes your bank account deposit and/or withdrawals activity is suspicious and/or may involve a pattern designed to avoid reporting requirements, they may seize your account. Think your money is safe in the bank? Think again. Digital cash a bit of Trap-it can be stolen.Think digital money is safer than cash and can’t be stolen? Some actually believe that in a cashless society that crime will go down and drug dealers will go out of business. Think again. In a cashless society, theft will occur on line and in far larger amounts than cash heists. An online thief never has to confront his victim, commit violence, crack a safe, get past an alarm system, dog or armed guards and carry away his loot. Rather, in a cashless society, the cyber thief merely has to hack the systems where the ‘money” is. The online heist involves no risk of death or threat to the thief’s personal safety and can be done from anywhere in the world. Without cash, the value of currency would have no independent value outside a functioning banking system to which you have access. Your money wouldn ‘work’ without a functioning banking system. If the banking system is down due to a power outage, solar flare, financial crisis, Internet failure, hack or network crash, your money is unavailable and potentially lost. If back up files are lost how do you prove you had $15,000 in your account? Even if the digital banking system was 100% fool proof, you may end up being shut out of the system for wrong doing (actual or alleged), bad credit or failure to pay banking fees. Or you may be the victim of identity theft and as a “precaution” your account may be closed. Without access to the banking system, how will you pay your bills and buy items you need? While going cashless may be convenient when you choose to buy something, but if a purchase is thrust officiously upon you by government order, your money can be removed from your account to pay for it, conveniently of course. This type of forced convenience results in a removal of freedom of choice of how you may wish to spend your money. Property rights are the foundation of a free society. If you don’t have control, ready access or the ability to spend your money when and as you please, you do not really own it.Rather, you are a co-owner with the currency issuer (the bank) who has veto rights over your use of the currency. In a cashless society there is the loss of privacy. Digital money offers the convenience of allowing you to track and budget your money online. Such a system, however, also leaves a permanent digital foot print of where you spent your money, accesible to just about anyone who has access to your account. (crimminal hackers and government agencies). A common objection to this privacy invasion is that “If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about”. Without cash, consumers are no longer market participants that evaluate tangible value based on how much cash they have in their wallets, but mindless spenders without a sense of the value of the items they are purchasing or a sense of understanding of their actual cost after incurring bank and credit card interest fees. (still sky high even after years of zero interest rate policies across the globe). In a society that uses cash, acts like making change and giving tips provide market participants with a tangible sense of economic value. Children that grow up saving money in piggy banks and counting their pennies, nickels and dimes learn the value of money through the tactil experience of handling money. A cashless society turns money and value into digital abstractions as defined and controlled by the banks and central planners. What to Own When the Dollar Collapses When it comes to preparing for an economic collapse, there are a lot of different schools of thought. Some people believe that stockpiling food and supplies is the best way to go, while others think that having a stash of cash on hand is the key to weathering the storm. But what if neither of those options is available to you? What if the only thing left to rely on is your own two hands? In this blog post, we are going to take a look at every possible solution for what to own when the dollar collapses. A part of this article is summarized in the following video: Precious metals like gold and silver have been used as a form of currency and store of value for centuries. In times of economic or political turmoil, precious metals are often seen as a safe haven asset. Investors typically turn to gold when they are worried about inflation eroding the purchasing power of their paper money holdings. Gold is also seen as a hedge against geopolitical risk. Silver, on the other hand, is more industrial in nature and is used in many different industries, from electronics to photography. As such, it can be more sensitive to economic trends. When considering investing in precious metals, it’s important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Each investor’s circumstances are unique and will dictate what type of investment makes sense. But for those looking for an alternative to traditional investments like stocks and bonds, precious metals may be worth considering. A few additional precious metals for your consideration: When it comes to foreign currency, there are a few different options that can be considered. Investing in foreign stocks could be a very wise move. After all, if the value of the dollar plummets, then the value of foreign stocks is likely to go up since they will be priced in stronger currencies. Of course, there are risks involved with investing in foreign stocks. For one thing, you may not be familiar with the company or understand how it operates in its home country. Additionally, political and economic conditions in other countries can impact your investment (think Brexit). That being said, here are a few foreign stocks that could be worth considering: When it comes to protecting your portfolio from a potential dollar collapse, there is an option to invest in foreign bonds. Foreign bonds can offer stability and diversification, as well as the potential for higher returns. There are a number of factors to consider when investing in foreign bonds, including inflation rates, interest rates, and political risk. Inflationary risks are particularly important to consider, as high inflation can erode the value of your investment. It’s also important to be aware of currency risks – if the value of the US dollar falls relative to other currencies, your investment will lose value (in USD terms). One way to mitigate some of these risks is to invest in foreign bonds with shorter durations – that is, bonds that mature sooner rather than later. This way you’re not exposed to as much interest rate or currency risk. Another strategy is to ladder your investments, which means investing in a series of bonds with different maturity dates, so that not all of your money is invested at once. Of course, no investment is without risk – but by diversifying into foreign bonds you can help protect yourself against the potentially devastating effects of a collapsing dollar. As a side note, keep in mind that a direct purchase of foreign bonds can be a highly challenging task. Try going through an exchange-traded fund or a closed-end fund to ensure a successful purchase. The following video from Kingcademy gives a crash course on foreign bonds: While gold, land, and various commodities propose a physical form of investment, you can diversify your assets by investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is often called “digital gold” because like gold, it is scarce (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence), durable (it can’t be destroyed or corrupted) and portable (you can carry millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin in your pocket). It also has similar properties to gold in that it isn’t controlled by any government or central bank. This makes it an appealing choice for people who are looking to protect their wealth from inflation or a potential collapse of the US Dollar. Other cryptocurrencies also offer similar benefits. Ethereum, for example, has been designed with the intention of being used as a global currency and platform for decentralized applications. This makes it different from Bitcoin, which was primarily designed as a digital store of value. However, both Bitcoin and Ethereum offer investors protection from inflation and the possibility of huge gains if they continue to rise in popularity and value. Collectibles can hold their intrinsic value even when the local currency loses its own value. Here are some things to consider collecting: Real estate is a solid option that shields you against the devaluation of the US dollar. Let’s review the reasons: For these reasons, investing in income-producing real estate should be considered by anyone looking to protect their wealth during an economic downturn. When the dollar collapses, land and agricultural commodities will be some of the best investments you can make. Here’s why: A major economical collapse might require more than just investing in precious metals and foreign currencies. There is a good chance you will need to live off the grid, away from your country’s control and infrastructures. Here are some things you can do to be prepared and survive: There is much more to learn about living off the grid, which is why I invite you to read my complete guide on off grid living. When the dollar collapses, barter items will become increasingly important. Here are some items that will be especially valuable. You will notice some similarities with the previous list, since both lists deal with items essential to your survival and independence. When it comes to investing in the face of an impending dollar collapse, there are a few key things you should keep in mind. First and foremost, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. Invest in a variety of assets that will hold their value even if the dollar does tank. Gold and silver are always reliable choices, but, as stated earlier, you can also look into investments like real estate or art. Another important thing to remember is that timing is everything. If you wait until after the dollar has already collapsed, it will be too late to invest. You need to get ahead of the curve and start investing now. The sooner you do, the better position you’ll be in when (or if) the bottom falls out from under the dollar. Finally, don’t panic! It’s easy to let fear take over when thinking about such a potentially catastrophic event as a currency collapse. But try to stay calm and rational; otherwise you could make some very costly mistakes with your investment portfolio. Stay safe and be prepared! First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE Hiroshima. Chernobyl. Nagasaki. Fukushima. They’re practically household names at this point. As such, most people know that the consequences of the radioactive fallout spread far beyond the borders of these towns and cities. What you may not realize, however, is just how far. In some cases, the consequences might seem trivial. Take, for example, the lack of salad greens throughout France for months following the Chernobyl disaster. Meanwhile, the black rain following the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were clearly devastating. In this regard, radioactive fallout can be elusive—taking a ruinous toll on some, while others are left seemingly untouched. Either way, the most important point to remember is that fallout is the inevitable result of practically any major nuclear event. It doesn’t matter whether you’re talking about a meltdown at one of the world’s 450 active nuclear facilities, a terrorist attack with a dirty bomb, or full-scale nuclear war: fallout will be a fact of life for anyone in the surrounding area. The silver lining? Radioactive fallout isn’t nearly as instantaneous, destructive, and unpredictable as a nuclear blast or meltdown. Indeed, it is something that you can prepare for—something you can work around and navigate your way through. Is It Legal To Go Off The Grid In Your State? In this video you will discover the most shocking things hidden by your government! So in this post, we’re going to take a deeper look at the nature of nuclear fallout and delve a bit deep into the chances of surviving a nuclear attack. This means we’re going to look at the science behind it, the basics of how fallout works, the situations that can arise, and the challenges you may face in the event of a nuclear disaster. We will also pay close attention to prevailing wind patterns and geography, allowing us to gauge how much radioactive fallout you would potentially be exposed to during a nuclear attack or disaster. And perhaps most importantly, we’re going to touch on a few basic things that you can easily do in order to prepare for—and ultimately survive—short-term exposure to nuclear fallout as you make your way to safety. For the roughly 100 million Americans living within the fallout zone of an active nuclear reactor, this could be an important read. So let’s get started… What few people appreciate, however, is the true magnitude of nuclear events—or the massive amounts of toxic fallout they can produce. After all, there are a few key things that nuclear bombs and meltdowns both do exceptionally well: Pulverizing matter over a wide area, nuclear events can create a tremendous amount of debris, ash, and particulates. These rapidly increase exposure for those in the immediate area—where the highest concentrations of fallout and radiation can be found. In a subterranean explosion, called a “base surge,” this phenomenon is even more pronounced—with an effect akin to that of an active volcano. Nuclear events irradiate this pulverized material, creating an unintentional but extremely toxic concentration of debris, dust, ash, and fallout—all while local residents are most likely seeking medical attention or escape. Finally, nuclear events propel the radioactive material into the stratosphere. In fact, in some cases, nuclear events can contaminate entire wind patterns with high concentrations of irradiated fallout. That’s how these events have lasting—albeit milder—effects hundreds or thousands of miles away. When it comes to determining the extent and volume of fallout following any particular nuclear event, there are two key factors to consider. First, there’s the location of the explosion. If it’s an airburst, then comparatively little fallout will be produced (but there will be a substantial EMP wave). However, if it’s a surface explosion, material will actually be pulled up into the nuclear cloud and irradiated before it’s carried along the plume into the upper atmosphere. Consequently, you might think an explosion over water would be more favorable—but that’s just not the case. You see, the explosion evaporates water and irradiates the remaining sea salt, producing much finer and smaller radioactive particles that can spread across a much larger area. This fallout can then seed clouds and rain back down on cities hundreds or even thousands of miles away. And it goes without saying that this fallout won’t simply wash off the outside of a building. Indeed, water surface bursts can even pulverize the sea floor. During the infamous Castle Bravo nuclear test, for instance, where a massive chain reaction was accidentally triggered due to the bomb’s peculiar construction, it was reported that calcinated white powder (pulverized coral) rained down on nearby boats. Subsurface bursts, meanwhile, become even more complicated, because the base surge they produce can flood the surrounding areas with lethal doses of radiation before the fallout even arrives. The second key factor is meteorological. Though it’s frightening to think that something as devastating as nuclear fallout is determined by the way the wind blows, that, we’re afraid, is exactly the case. This means that, due to the fine particulates produced by a nuclear blast, fallout can easily be carried over hundreds of miles in a matter of hours and days. Of course, the greatest intensity of the fallout is felt in the immediate area of the nuclear event, but radioactive materials can nevertheless spread far and wide due to its volatile nature. Part of this is accomplished through the animal kingdom. For livestock who graze in fields covered in nuclear fallout, for instance, their radioactive diet might prompt their extermination (as in Chernobyl). In other instances, however, they may spread the fallout further by carrying it in their fur, droppings, and bodies. Vegetation is a concern here, too. After all, crops can be dusted with fallout from an explosion hundreds of miles away, as was the case with the French salad greens mentioned above. These plants typically have to be safely destroyed to contain exposure. But ultimately, the nature of exposure, how it works, and what constitutes a lethal dose of radiation—these things are still widely debated and little understood. But, when it comes to fallout, there are a few things that can be said for certain: Fallout isn’t always predictable, it’s got devastating potential, and knowing what to expect can provide a crucial advantage at a time when most people will still be reeling. Facing the reality of a nuclear detonation (and the fallout that comes with it) might feel overwhelming to think about. With that said, it’s far from being a hopeless scenario. Consider Akiko Takakura, for example, who was just 300 meters from ground zero at the Hiroshima explosion but survived unscathed. Eizo Nomura, meanwhile, was even closer, at just 155 meters from the hypocenter. That means he stood less than two football fields from a nuclear explosion and still lived well into his eighties. This, of course, raises the question: how did they survive a nuclear bomb going off right on top of them while so many others perished? In reality, there are four key factors that will determine whether you’re safe from the fallout of a nuclear detonation or meltdown: As we’ll cover in just a moment, time is crucial after a nuclear blast. You’ll only have about fifteen minutes to seek sufficient cover, but radiation will die down to acceptable levels in most of the blast area after just a few days. Note that fallout is at its absolute worst in the first 72 hours, so it’s crucial to evacuate immediately or stay sheltered. After a few weeks, you’ll be able to make longer trips outside (if you haven’t yet evacuated). While there are a handful of cases like those mentioned above, close proximity to a nuclear blast and the immediate fallout tend to spell certain disaster. So while it makes sense to shelter in place during the worst of the fallout, your ultimate goal will be to put a safe distance between you and the bomb’s lingering radioactive effects. In an instant, the initial fireball and scorching thermal radioactive material of a nuclear detonation gives way to what’s called gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is notoriously powerful, able to penetrate inches of heavy material (even thick lead plating) and rapidly poison the body, so shielding can play a vital role in protecting you from radiation. Notably, both of the Hiroshima survivors mentioned above were underground in a shielded concrete basement, which was the key to their survival. Radioactive materials decay at different rates, which can affect everything from timing and distance to the amount of shielding needed to protect yourself. Here, it’s worth noting that each of these factors interacts with the others. So if you’ve got a robust enough shelter, you won’t have to worry so much about distance. Likewise if you enter an area weeks after the fallout has dissipated. In that spirit, let’s take a look at how you might really survive a modern nuclear event. First things first: if you’re exposed to a nuclear detonation or meltdown, it will be a hard thing to miss. You’ll either see it, hear about it on the news, take note of a special nuclear fallout alarm, or catch on as those around you react to what’s going on. In the first crucial minutes, your very first priority will be finding the best possible shelter nearby. This is because you’ll have about fifteen minutes or less to do so. Remember that cars provide absolutely no protection, and that any (indoor) shelter is better than being outside. Once you’ve found the right place, go to the deepest room inside it. You’re basically trying to put as many walls as possible between you and the outside world, even if that means holing up in a linen closet. Note that you’ll want to make sure you’re away from doors, windows, and anything else that might be exposed to the outside world. It’s even a good idea to tape up the cracks around doors and windows, to prevent particulates from seeping in. PRO TIP While we want to stress the importance and gravity of the information we’re presenting, we also want to establish some reasons as to why you should remain calm. Once you’re confident in your shelter, you’ll want to gather supplies. We’ll talk more later about which supplies are best to keep on hand (ideally you’ve got a bug-out bag), but you’ll want to lay hands on as much food, water, and other essentials as you can find without leaving your shelter. Once the fallout sets in, it won’t be safe to eat anything (even packaged food) from outside your shelter. It’s also a good idea to remove your outer layer of clothing, take a shower, if possible, and change clothes, as this ensures that you’re not wearing fallout in your shelter. The same holds true for any pets that were outside—give them a good wash to minimize radiation exposure. After that, waiting is the name of the game. Note that in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion, radiation levels will typically be extreme, and fallout will be at its worst. This is when you’re most likely to see effects like the black rain that came down on Hiroshima after the nuclear explosion there. Fortunately, the worst of this fallout will dissipate quickly. In some cases, radiation levels can drop from as much as 1,000 roentgens/hour to as little as 10 roentgens/hour in just the first three days. That’s why it’s so crucial to stay inside, away from windows and doors, during the entire first 72 hours. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! This is where a radio can come in handy, giving you a crucial lifeline to the outside world. After all, for the next 72 hours, you’re going to want to stay buried as deep as possible in your shelter while the intensity of radiation outside plummets to more liveable levels. After that, in many cases it should be safe for short trips outside. Of course, there’s no guarantee, as each nuclear event plays out differently. Regardless, by the 72-hour mark, you can start thinking about making your way to safety or at least assessing your surroundings. Here, it’s important to stress that even if the nuclear event doesn’t happen in your immediate area—even if it’s hundreds of miles away—the fallout could still potentially reach you in a day or less. So, even if you’re just watching the news or monitoring releases from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) about a nuclear event on television, don’t hesitate to start making preparations. To survive nuclear attacks and ensure minimal damage, it will take more than being lucky; you should prepare. When preparing for something like a major nuclear event (and the fallout that comes with it), you run the risk of preparing in a manner that’s either too specific or too broad to be truly helpful. So instead, it’s best to break things down to their components—then focus on doing the best job with each individual component. For example, it’s generally a great idea to stock up on food and water. This is especially useful in the event of nuclear fallout, because the more food and water you have, the longer you’ll be able to stick to your shelter and avoid the radiation outside. Ideally, you’ll want at least a two week supply of food and water on hand. If and when that food is depleted, you’ll need an escape plan to get you to safety. If you’re in a city, that might mean making it to the country. Or if you’re on the coast, it might entail driving to a family cabin in the mountains. Regardless of your exit strategy, it’s important to have one, whilst keeping a few backups in case things don’t go exactly to plan. Since any realistic exit strategy will have you leaving your home after a few days, weeks, or months, it’s prudent to stock up on hazmat gear as well. MIRA Safety’s HAZSUIT, CM-6M mask, and NBC-77 SOF filter all have a long shelf life and can be paired with Kappler chemtape, tough chemical-resistant gloves, and overboots for complete protection. While it might be tempting to save a few dollars on your hazmat gear, it’s important to remember that not all suits are created equal. Ultra-cheap suits, for instance, can easily be punctured, exposing you to dangerous elements. Military suits, meanwhile, feature carbon lining and breathable composition, but they can be prohibitively expensive or hard to find (something we’re working on improving). Our HAZSUIT, on the other hand, strikes a nice compromise between the two, with reliable puncture-resistant performance and an appealing price point. It’s also great to keep an emergency package around for storms, blizzards, hurricanes or tornadoes. That kit should include a crank-style emergency radio, basic first aid kit, matches, flashlights, and other basic utilities. Once again, these are all great tools to have on hand in case of nuclear war—especially the radio. Some folks will even go as far as to prepare a special fallout room/nuclear war shelter, reinforcing walls with wood, concrete, bricks, and sand to thicken barriers and cut down on possible radiation. While this might seem like overkill, a few minor considerations can actually upgrade an existing storm/hurricane shelter to something that would increase your odds of surviving a nuclear event. Plus, even just a few inches of barrier could provide much needed protection from the gamma radiation mentioned above. In the end, there’s a wealth of knowledge to consult online, and there are plenty of contractors who would be willing to work with you on a custom setup. Perhaps the most specific preparation for nuclear fallout should be in your bug-out bag. After all, you may be at work, school, or otherwise away from home when a nuclear event occurs—in which case a bug-out bag is a crucial lifeline to get you to safety. That’s why there are a few must-have items we recommend for everyone’s bug-out bag: Thyrosafe tablets are a cheap and easy purchase—and one of the items most likely to save your life. But how do they work? Well, these powerful pills flood your thyroid with safe iodine, enough to keep your system from absorbing any for the next 24 hours. This is crucial, because radioactive iodine (I-131) is a major factor in nuclear fallout, accumulating in your thyroid and rapidly poisoning the rest your body with radiation. One little pill, however, has the power to stop that process dead in its tracks. A reliable gas mask, like the MIRA Safety CM-6M or military-grade CM-7M full-face gas mask, is a bug-out bag must-have. Although dangerous radiation can pierce concrete with ease, radioactive particles can still be extremely dangerous, especially in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion. There might also be fires and chemical or biological elements in the environment. While a gas mask is only part of a larger system of personal protective equipment (PPE), it remains a staple, as it’s highly mobile, easy to carry, and can save your life in the right circumstances. To filter out that radioactive iodine, you’ll need a gas mask filter that’s reactor-rated. In this regard, the MIRA Safety NBC-77 SOF filter is a great choice, because it also provides protection against a number of other chemical, biological, and radiological threats while having a twenty-year shelf life and lightweight construction. Even if you’ve already got one at home, an emergency radio is well-worth the investment. After all, when hunkering down in a shelter, there’s a good chance that cell phones and standard phone lines will go down, but emergency radio broadcasts will let you know whether it’s safe to go outside. Note that these things cost just a few bucks, they’re compact, and they can be just as much of a lifesaver as the Thyrosafe tablets. Lastly, pack whatever else fits, including a hazmat suit and chemtape for sealing things up. Granted, these inclusions won’t necessarily be practical in most bug-out bags—indeed, it might be a better idea to just double down on your food supplies. Nonetheless, a hazmat suit and chemtape can be helpful for navigating the environment after you survive the first 72 hours. A gas mask, however, is a definite must-have, because it can be carried with ease and donned in a matter of seconds, while a hazmat suit can take substantially longer to deploy. Of course, this is all in addition to what you might already have in your standard bug-out bag—but it shouldn’t add too much weight. Note that MIRA Safety even offers a special package that includes a gas mask, filter, Thyrosafe tablets, and a drop-leg pouch to store it all. Regardless, these key preparations are easy to make—and potentially extremely useful in other situations as well (particularly in relation to the gas mask). We understand that the prospect of surviving the aftermath of a nuclear event is rather daunting. Hopefully, however, it seems a bit less overwhelming than it did just a few minutes ago. Make no mistake—it would still almost certainly be the single most challenging day of your life. And a variety of factors will inevitably remain well outside of your control. However, with a bit of careful preparation and consideration, you can vastly increase your own odds of surviving the nightmare of a nuclear explosion and attendant fallout. Remember: it’s all about those crucial first 72 hours. From the first fifteen minutes to those first three days, simple decisions could have massive consequences for your survival. So find the safest possible shelter, hunker down, and wait out the worst of the radiation. Granted, even after everything we’ve covered, even after preparation and planning, you’ve still got to be ready in case things go awry. So, what will you do if your primary shelter is suddenly out of the question? What if you don’t have a bug-out bag handy? Preparing for multiple contingencies with layered plans can further improve your chances of survival and help you adapt to challenges on the fly. Therefore, be sure to identify good shelter locations near the places you spend most of your time, and stock up on backups wherever possible.

Aside from economic collapse scenarios, many countries are in the process of eliminating physical cash and coins. Instead, everyone has an account that holds their money. You cannot purchase goods or services without access to government-based cryptocurrency. Even if the currency itself is still backed by faith in the government, you have to use this electronic system. The result is multiple problems that could leave you in a situation where you have the money in the bank to pay your bills and purchase goods and services, yet you cannot do so. These threats include: These hacks usually affect the bank or primary clearinghouse rather than a specific person’s account. You may be unable to purchase goods or services for hours or days. While this is inconvenient, it isn’t as bad as a full collapse, where the banks close for good. There’s only so much you can do about this kind of hack other than make sure you can go two weeks without buying anything at any given time. It is also essential to keep a paper-based address book with phone numbers and account information so that you can contact utility companies or others who may be expecting payments from you while the bank or clearinghouse is down. Let’s say you can connect to Wi-Fi independently of the SIM Card. Your phone app may not work with Wi-Fi. This is why I recommend having an app on your phone that doesn’t use the SIM card to dial out on Wi-Fi so that you can make the necessary calls. If the hacker was able to steal money from your accounts, it could take weeks to years before you recover the money. In the short term, you will have to shut down credit cards and so on, then wait for new ones to come in the mail. You may also have to manage restoring devices and regaining access to your accounts. Here again, make sure you can go at least 2 weeks without buying anything so that you can manage your basic necessities. Merchant Category Codes are unique identifiers that put different products into separate categories. For example, food has one set of numeric identifiers, while clothing has other identifiers. Even without looking at your receipt, the bank and transaction clearinghouse may have some ideas about what you bought. The transaction cost can then give some estimates about quantity and item type. One day, data from all banks and clearinghouses may pool into a central government computer. Social credit scores work like your financial-based credit scores. Consider how your financial credit score enables businesses to “reward” you with credit or better interest rates if you pay your bills on time and have an optimal debt-to-income ratio. Your social credit score looks at how you act in society. For example, China has a system that rewards things like donating blood. This same system “punishes” people who drive drunk or engage in other activities that aren’t “beneficial to society.” People with good social credit scores may get tax breaks, an increased chance of getting a promotion, or other benefits. When vaccines became available for COVID-19, governments worldwide were concerned because people hesitated to embrace mRNA vaccines. This led to people not complying with recommendations to get vaccinated. Social credit scores can be paired with cashless systems that will block purchasing from specific merchant category codes. It could become possible to deny people the ability to buy food, gas, and other essentials if they aren’t vaccinated. When you can’t use cash, pressure campaigns like this will be almost 100% effective because you will have to comply or do without the necessities of life. The only way to outlast a pressure campaign like this is to have a stockpile of food and other essentials that will last until the pressure tactics are stopped. At first, you might think merchant credit codes will only come into play when the government seeks to limit, slow down, or prevent purchasing certain goods and services. The problem is that modern networks aren’t safe from hackers, including those who seek to disrupt trade for ethical reasons. For example, the Internet Archive was recently targeted by a hacktivist group, Blackmeta. They claim they attacked this non-profit library site because it is based in the USA and, therefore, is aligned with Israeli activities. Ironically, the Internet Archive has been locked in multiple court battles with publishers that may be far more aligned with Israel. These publishers, in turn, are trying to shut down the Internet Archive because when people don’t buy from the publisher, it cuts into their profits. Now imagine this kind of situation happening with the information stolen from the Heritage Foundation, and then used to target more granular data in banks and merchant clearinghouse systems. You could very easily see transactions declined for what appears to be “government” or other legislative curbs, when in fact, it’s some group attacking you because of a “social credit score” known only to them. If you want to buy something right now, you can just put your credit card away and use cash. This won’t be possible once the only fiat currency available is electronic in nature. No matter how much you want to look at the potential for excess government imposition, the fact remains any group with sufficient skills and interest can cause serious problems. AI can keep track of billions of records and patterns of activity. This includes determining if what you buy is “normal” for your location as well as for you as a consumer within a particular category. Right now, that’s likely beyond the implementation of the cashless centralized government cryptocurrency systems. At some point, though, someone on something like the “no-fly list,” etc., could wind up unable to buy certain items or in certain quantities and not realize there is a curb based on a government-based list. Considering how many lists there are, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to resolve the problem and purchase goods in a timely manner. This includes lists that may be compiled based on estimated political slant. Consider that even now, traffic cameras can match license plates with bumper stickers and yard political signs to determine your likely preferences. When you factor in non-governmental groups, the situation gets even worse. Technologically speaking, it’s within the scope of foreign agents and hacktivists to bring together limits on how you spend your money and non-financial activities. As we are seeing in various hacks, there is certainly a “social credit score” being applied to businesses that can be scaled to target individuals who may want to purchase extra supplies to manage an emergency. Right now you can protect your money while it is still in your control. First, it is very important to keep your money in different banks. Even if one goes down, the others may still be functioning. This applies to credit and debit cards. If you have only Visa cards, ensure you have at least one Mastercard. You can do this with prepaid cards as well as more permanent accounts. This method won’t work if every transaction must go through a centralized clearinghouse that includes every possible bank or other institution. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether that kind of system exists and how various groups would use or misuse it. Second, if you routinely buy from certain stores, you can purchase gift cards and have the money ready and waiting in your account. If you cannot access your bank account, you can still buy from that store. This won’t necessarily prevent you from running into rationing or other limits that may be imposed by the government through the store or at the store level. Preparing for small—and large-scale disasters is essential for your well-being and that of your family. You can still use bartering, provided you have a clear sense of the value of what you will offer and whether or not the other party needs what you have. Make consistent contacts with small or local farmers and others who may be willing to take something in exchange for food. The trade could be anything from assisting with mechanical repairs to making garments. Everything will depend on the relationship you develop and the situation. You can make barter arrangements for just about anything from tangible goods to training in various skills. Look for small businesses and local groups, as they may be more open to these kinds of arrangements. Spending a few dollars extra and supporting these people now may be very useful later on. This is also a good time to form relationships with established flea markets and others with different kinds of products. These people may be very helpful when you find a way to barter for tools or other goods that you can no longer purchase using money. Here again, you have to know what their needs are and how you can meet them. As hacks on banks, hospitals, water purification plants, and the government itself become more common, it should be obvious that a cashless society can pose significant risks if you aren’t prepared. Taking a few simple measures now may help you get through these situations as painlessly as possible. The most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! Video HERE. None of us is really looking forward to the next great depression, even while we’re all expecting it to come. The reality is that rough financial times are worrisome for everyone, including the most prepared preppers amongst us. While you and I might be better off than our neighbors are, there’s still the possibility of losing our jobs, followed by our cars and then our homes. Since one of the marks of depression is high unemployment, there’s no guarantee that any of us will manage to keep our jobs or even find another job if we lose ours. While 75% of people managed to keep their jobs back in the Great Depression of the last century, it is the 25% of them who lost their jobs that we all focus on. This shaky job market, coupled with a potential for high inflation make for a rough financial time for just about everyone. Oh, there are always those who have enough money that it doesn’t really matter; I’m not one of those people and I doubt that you are either. While we don’t know just when that next depression is going to come or what will be the actual trigger, there are plenty of things going on in the current economy to give us concern. More and more economists and financial planners of all stripes are warning people about the collapse that’s coming. Some even going so far as to say that it will be much worse than the Great Depression of the last century. So, what are we going to do when it comes? Or, perhaps even more importantly, what should we avoid doing when it comes? The first thing to realize is that the shape of the economy, including the shape of the stock market, is largely psychological. Stocks rise and fall in value due to people’s perceptions, more than anything tangible that can be pointed to. Once those people realize the mistake they’ve made, things can turn around just as quickly. It’s easy to fall into fear during times of uncertainty. But that fear will cause you to make poor decisions, just like those people trading on the stock market. While there may be plenty to be fearful about, you don’t have to fall for it, even if everyone else does. Rather, think through your situation and make the best possible decisions to protect yourself and your family. Remember, even though 25% of workers lost their jobs during the Great Depression, 75% of the people managed to keep theirs. Work on being part of that 75%. Whatever you do, don’t quit your job, no matter how bad you think it is or how much you feel they don’t appreciate you. At least you have a job and you can pay the bills. If you quit, without already having another job that you’re contracted for, you may not end up being able to get another job for months or even years. If you don’t feel that the job is meeting your financial needs, then the answer isn’t quitting, it’s reevaluating your spending and looking for a way to lower your costs. Chances are that you’re living above your means. That’s not your employer’s fault, so you can’t expect them to pay for it. With so many people losing their jobs, the one thing you want to do is make sure you keep your own. In many companies, that means becoming the indispensable person. The last one they would want to lay off. That won’t work in jobs which are controlled by unions, as all that matters then is seniority, but if that’s not an issue for the job you have, then do whatever you have to, in order to make them think that they can’t live without you. More than anything, this means going above and beyond on a regular basis. I did this in my engineering career, earning myself a number of promotions. I then passed that work ethic on to my children. When my son’s company (he works for a petroleum company) was laying people off left and right, he got a 40% raise, because they couldn’t afford to lose him. The people who have the most trouble dealing with any financial downturn are those who are saddled with a lot of debt. That can be exacerbated even more by losing a job. But even for those who manage to keep their jobs, unnecessary debt becomes a burden that’s hard to bear. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but inflation generally goes hand-in-hand with times of economic downturn. While that doesn’t mean that the cost of those debts will climb in any way, it does mean that the amount of disposable income available will shrink, leading to making some hard decisions, like paying for the new car or eating. For those who lose their jobs, all those debts make it harder to survive, financially speaking. Not only are they likely to lose whatever they bought on credit, but in trying to do everything they can to keep their heads above water, financially speaking, they might end up losing something even more important, like their home, because of that car payment. All Americans Will Lose Their Home, Income And Power By November 27, 2025 Watch the video below! Cosigning on a loan is a risky move at any time. By doing so, you’re promising to make the payment, if the borrower can’t. That puts your finances in captivity to their ability to pay their obligations. If they don’t follow the kind of advice I’m writing in this article and end up losing their job, you’re going to end up being legally forced to pay for whatever you cosigned on. During a time of financial depression, that could be enough to sink your own finances. The “Great Recession” of 2008-2009 was caused by adjustable rate and balloon mortgages. Written in the time of President Clinton’s presidency, these were intended to make it possible for people who couldn’t otherwise afford a home, the ability to buy one. The idea was sold on the basis of some financial projections that didn’t come to pass. When the interest rate or mortgage payment went up, the people who had taken out those loans found themselves unable to make their payments. It was even worse for those whose mortgages included balloon payments, as they hadn’t prepared for that huge payment. The result was that thousands of people lost their homes, pushing the nation and then the world into the recession. There’s nothing wrong with refinancing, if it can be done in such a way as to save you money. But take care when doing so, that you understand exactly what the terms of the loan are. Don’t accept something which will cause your payments to go up sometime in the future. As we’ve all seen, that’s dangerous. The last Great Depression came about largely due to people investing money they didn’t have, in stocks they didn’t understand. They were essentially buying stocks with borrowed money. That still happens today, with people “leveraging” their funds to buy more than they otherwise would be able to. The problem with that investment, like any other investment, is that it can go down, just as easily as it can go up. The “sure thing” your buddy talks you into may not be anywhere near as sure as he thinks it is. While some percentage of those really do pay off; most do not, leaving people with a sizeable loss. My personal philosophy about investing is that I see it as a gamble. As such, I won’t invest any more than I feel I can afford to lose. While I’ve missed a lot of opportunities that way, including a recent one that could have paid me 30 to 1, I haven’t lost any money that way either. Perhaps one of the more foolish things that someone can do during a depression, besides taking on new debt, is to upgrade their lifestyle. Even if you get a promotion at work, with a nice fat raise, there’s no real security that you’ll hang onto that during a time of depression. Rather than spending that money to buy a new car or a boat, use it to pay down your debt, so that later, when the economy is on steadier ground, you can afford to really enjoy it. If anything, a depression is a time to bring down your lifestyle a bit; doing everything you can to lower your expenses. That will give you more flexibility with your finances, especially if things take a turn for the worst. I know this is going to sound like a contradiction to the last item; but don’t keep your money in cash either. Rather, put it into some sort of investment that is secure; while at the same time not requiring any borrowing on your part. Assuming that you are buying at the beginning of the inflationary cycle, probably the most secure investment would be in precious metals. That isn’t the only secure investment though. Bonds, especially federal and municipal bonds are secure investments. So are utility stocks and some of the blue chip stocks. Look to invest in things that will have to exist through the depression because people need them. Those are the places to invest. My favorite investment, for people who don’t have a lot to invest, is to invest in non-perishable food. On the average, food has been going up about 8% per year, even while the general inflation rate has been hovering under 1%. So, if someone buys $1,000 worth of food and holds onto it for five years, it will be worth almost $1,500 at the end of that time. They don’t even have to sell it to cash in either; all they’ve got to do is eat it and use the money they would normally spend on that food for other things. Finally, do everything you can to avoid defrauding your creditors. There are things you can do to protect your relationship with them, even if you can’t make your payments. The last thing that any creditor wants is to have one of their customers default, causing them to repossess property. They’re not in the business of selling that property; they’re in the business of selling loans. While loan forgiveness is rather rare, you might be able to get a forbearance or deferment on that loan. Both are common for student loans and mortgage companies are amiable to working with you in that way as well. Make contact with your lender, telling them what your situation is and asking them what they can do for you. Remember, you won’t be the only one going through hard financial times. They’re probably going to be even more aware of the problems going on than you are, as they are going to have a wider picture to look at. As such, they would rather work with you, than have to go through foreclosure. The Ultra-wealthy are Planning Your Future Right Now The ultra-wealthy are planning your future right now. They’ll call it ‘utopia’ and sell it to you as such, but it’s actually the opposite. Welcome to the first of a two-part series. Utopia is a place of “ideal perfection, especially in laws, government, and social conditions.” At least, that’s the dictionary definition. The thing is, despite humans having tried for thousands of years to attain Eden-esque perfection, it’s impossible. Worse, the irony of such efforts is literally baked into the word ‘utopia:’ From Merriam Webster (emphasis added): In 1516, English humanist Sir Thomas More published a book titled Utopia, which compared social and economic conditions in Europe with those of an ideal society on an imaginary island located off the coast of the Americas. More wanted to imply that the perfect conditions on his fictional island could never really exist, so he called it “Utopia,” a name he created by combining the Greek words ou (“not, no”) and topos (“place”). Still, that doesn’t stop people from trying to create fictional paradise. The latest attempts are — unsurprisingly — conceived of, funded by, and built by our billionaire overlords, who aim to own everything and define how our lives will be lived in the future. At the same time, a paradox is unfolding. While several attempts at billionaire-initiated paradises are currently in the works, some efforts are failing, some are falling apart, and some are simply struggling to get off the ground. What we know about Silicon Valley elites, bitcoin bros, and AI billionaires is that they dream big and have virtually limitless finances. So even failed attempts at utopia — or whatever their version of it is — gets the entire cohort a step closer to decoding a formula that might stick. It’s like unlimited funding to indulge a God complex. In part one of this series, we’re looking at four concepts for creating paradise on earth crafted by the freedom loving, libertarian, optimized-living-through-technology crowd. What exactly do these communities promise? Who’s behind them? And most importantly, could they just be 15-minute dystopian wolves in utopian sheep’s clothing? Let’s dive in. Próspera began as a bold libertarian experiment on the tropical island of Roatán, off the northern coast of Honduras. It’s the brainchild of Erick Brimen, a Venezuelan-born wealth fund manager who imagined a city run not by politicians, but by market forces and blockchain logic. He’s aiming to create a low-tax, deregulated tech haven where businesses can make their own laws, or choose to implement existing national laws from a menu of 36 countries. Residents pay low taxes (payable in Bitcoin), and biotech startups push the limits of radical life extension with experimental, as yet unproven treatments disallowed in other countries. With venture capital backing from Coinbase and Sam Altman–linked projects, plus support from figures like Peter Thiel, Próspera has quickly become a magnet for crypto evangelists, longevity obsessives, and deregulation devotees. It hosts conferences with themes like: “Make death optional.” It’s creating a walled city with private arbitration courts, judges who adjudicate online from Arizona (no idea why Arizona — our research was not explicit), and QR-code entry checkpoints. But like all utopias, this charter city dream has clashed with reality. One critic called it a “libertarian fantasy… that’s not going to turn out well.” The Honduran government that initially supported the project and allowed for the zoning laws making it possible has since collapsed in scandal — with the former president serving time in US prison for conspiring to import and distribute over 400 tons of cocaine. That’s a lot of blow. Locals in the nearby village of Crawfish Rock have not taken kindly to the idea of the gated city and have accused Próspera of land grabs, environmental damage, and trying to push them out. When the current democratic socialist President, Xiomara Castro, declared the former administration’s zoning laws unconstitutional, Próspera fought back in international court, demanding nearly $11 billion USD in damages — about a third of the country’s GDP — an amount that would bankrupt the country if they lose the case. Brimen is doubling down, lobbying American politicians to argue in his favor and launching a spin-off project aimed at Africa. This all plays out as an ironic twist of history: a 21st-century version of the banana republic, complete with foreign investors, private courts, and corporate control over land, law, and labor. The term ‘banana republic’ was coined by author O. Henry to describe Honduras — a place where US fruit companies ran the economy. Now, crypto-capitalists and Silicon Valley VCs are picking up where the plantations left off, except this time, they’re promising immortality instead of bananas. NEOM was supposed to be Saudi Arabia’s leap into the future: a $500 billion high-tech oasis in the desert that would make even Silicon Valley blush. Conceived in 2017 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown jewel of his Vision 2030 plan, NEOM promised flying taxis, robot dinosaurs, artificial moons, a desert ski resort with fake snow, and a 170-kilometer mirrored city called The Line. This mirrored city was meant to stretch 170 kilometers across the desert with no cars, no roads, and no emissions — just smart infrastructure, biometric surveillance, and those previously mentioned flying taxis. But like many utopias, the fantasy is already buckling under the weight of reality. The goal was for The Line to eventually be home to 9 million people, with 1.5 million residents by 2030. Middle East Eye reports that Saudi officials now predict fewer than 300,000 in that time frame. Only 2.4 kilometers of The Line may actually be completed by 2030. Oil revenues — the main funding source — have declined sharply, and insiders say the kingdom is facing an “environment of limited resources.” Budget reviews are underway, and other NEOM projects (like the year-round ski resort) have been shelved, delayed, or drastically scaled back. Behind the glossy renderings lies a construction project with a dystopian work culture. NEOM’s former CEO, Nadhmi al-Nasr, developed a reputation for abusive management. “I drive everybody like a slave,” he said, celebrating “[w]hen they drop down dead… That’s how I do my projects.” In one case, he told an employee to “walk into the desert and die” so he could urinate on their grave. As a result, there has been a mass exodus of foreign executives, many of whom forfeited six-figure contracts just to escape the toxic environment. Meanwhile, members of the Howeitat tribe, native to the land NEOM occupies, have resisted the development. Many have been forcibly removed, at least one activist was killed, and others have been imprisoned for resisting eviction. Human rights groups have condemned the project, while NEOM’s own consultants warned that the mega-structure could actually change the weather and decimate bird populations due to its massive mirrored walls. None of this matters; Saudi officials press on. Promotional videos still promise a gleaming future where “Neomians” live in harmony with nature, technology, and robot dinosaurs. But those on the ground tell a different story — of constant surveillance, sexual harassment allegations ignored by leadership, and Orwellian control over employee life. Promises of a liberalized social zone — with alcohol, gender mixing, freedom — have quietly been walked back by a government known for its public stonings and other extreme punishment for ‘immorality.’ NEOM may, in fact, never turn out to be the future of urban life. But it may just be the world’s most expensive monument to authoritarian delusion: a dystopian nightmare of a city built on sand, surveillance, and slogans. Telosa is what happens when a billionaire tries to build a utopian city without using the word ‘utopia.’ Marc Lore, former Walmart executive and founder of Jet.com and Diapers.com, envisions a new city rising from scratch somewhere in the American desert (or possibly Appalachia), designed to be sustainable, walkable, tech-forward, and just equitable enough to keep you from asking too many questions. According to Telosa’s website, this categorically, definitely, 100 percent isn’t a utopia. Is the goal to create a utopia? No, we are absolutely not attempting to create a utopia. Utopian projects are focused on creating a perfect, idealistic state — we are not. We are firmly grounded in reality and what is possible. We are focused on the best, most sustainable solutions for infrastructure, urban design, economic vibrancy and city services, but we fully recognize that no solution is perfect and all human systems have flaws. Therefore, we are committed to new ideas, finding the best way to solve difficult problems and constant improvement. And yet the renderings and promo videos suggest otherwise: gleaming towers, shaded plazas, handicap-accessible courtyards, and monorails slicing silently through eco-optimized zones. If it looks like utopia, smells like utopia, and plans to engineer human behavior like utopia — well, you do the math. The project is called “Telosa,” from the Greek word telos — meaning “highest purpose.” Hey — stop calling it utopia! The big idea is for 50,000 people to move to this yet-to-be-determined place by 2030 and have the population eventually grow to 5 million. Everyone lives within a short walk (15 minutes maybe?) of everything they need — a school, a park, a job (lolz!), and probably an AI wellness coach. Cars, of course, are banned. There will be solar-powered towers and vertical farms and an economy based on “equitism,” a remix of a 19th-century idea where the city itself owns the land and uses rising property values to fund social services. But for all its lofty ideas, Telosa has yet to put a single shovel in the ground. There’s no final site, no government approval, and no clear funding beyond Lore’s initial push. It’s still just a shimmering concept, a mirage sketched by a star architect (Bjarke Ingels) and floated in interviews, TED talks, and design expos. Critics argue that if Lore really wanted to help people, he could invest in solving infrastructure problems in existing cities. Others point out that “15-minute cities” — the model Telosa clearly mirrors — have become a global flashpoint, praised by urban planners but derided by skeptics as a way to centralize control, limit movement, and monitor citizens. So far, Telosa’s biggest achievement is that it’s really good at marketing a city that doesn’t exist. If it ever does gets built, we may finally get to ask: does a billionaire-designed city really offer freedom — or just the illusion of choice in a world where the architecture has already made the decisions for you? If you’ve ever dreamed of escaping taxes, regulations, and society itself, there’s a billionaire-funded plan for that: Seasteading — the floating libertarian fantasy that just won’t sink, no matter how many times it fails. First floated (literally and ideologically) by the Seasteading Institute in 2008, the project was originally funded by… wait for it… Peter Thiel. He envisioned self-governing cities bobbing peacefully in international waters until backing away from the idea and stating they were “not quite feasible from an engineering perspective.” The concept was a nation without a nation, where entrepreneurs could escape pesky things like labor laws, zoning, and democracy. In short: Silicon Valley meets Waterworld, minus the humility. An initial prototype near Thailand ended with Thai authorities raiding the floating platform and accusing the residents of endangering national sovereignty, an offense punishable by life imprisonment or death. The couple that lived on the house boat went into hiding and the Thai navy eventually hauled away what was essentially a raft with Wi-Fi. The broader Seasteading movement has since splintered, evolved, and — most recently — mutated into a newer project with fresher branding: Arkpad. “By building a community in the ocean, you’re not just creating a home; you’re crafting a legacy of innovation, freedom, and sustainability,” reads the marketing copy. Arkpad bills itself as a “sovereign lifestyle project” and a “network state” — crypto-native language for the same old dream: private governance, no taxes, total control. Based in the Philippines, Arkpad is aiming to build on ocean-based platforms and create a floating community, complete with decentralized ID systems, underwater real estate, and NFTs for residency. Because, of course. Their YouTube channel mixes crypto sermons with dreamy renderings of sleek structures rising from the sea — modern-day Noah’s Arks, minus the animals or flood, but heavy on Bitcoin and barnacles. Watch the videos carefully and you’ll see the architects’ sleek computer-generated renderings blur into the reality of what an Arkpad really is: a concrete block floating in the middle of absolutely nowhere. No word on whether they supply residents with free Dramamine. Just like Seasteading before it, Arkpad suffers from a chronic case of reality avoidance. Engineering constraints, rising ocean temperatures, maritime law, international sovereignty, and basic logistical challenges all still exist. What’s more, these projects have always been less about freedom for all and more about escape for the few. Not everyone is invited to these floating utopias. They’re luxury lifeboats for a digital elite preparing to sail away from the consequences of the world they helped wreck. Until further notice, Seasteading and Arkpad remain what they’ve always been: libertarian lighthouses in the fog — glowing ideals with no mooring in the real world. Whether real or imagined, all these utopian concepts promise clean slates and high-tech harmony in their own way, plugged into the seductive guarantee of a new way to live. Blockchain ruled and perfect in efficiency, there remains only one slight problem: Reality. History shows that when elites indulge in the fantasy of utopias, reality always gets in the way. Wealthy eccentricity is tolerable for a small group of like-minded disciples, but humans are not robots. Therefore, it’s unlikely that a utopia cooked up by some micro-dosing, immortality-seeking tech bro could ever be scaled up except through heavy reliance on surveillance, coercion, and control — where things eventually devolve into socially engineered, privacy-erasing digital prisons, wrapped in glossy marketing brochures and eco-communal delusion. There’s also the problem of governments — they’re not into the whole competition thing. But hey, that’s not going to stop these billionaires from trying. So in part two of this series, we’ll look at some of the other ways billionaires are planning to control the future of urban living and how it might affect you. At the top of the financial pyramid sits the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland , the “central bank of central banks.” It acts as a clearinghouse for financial operations between major nations and secretly controls monetary policy for over 60 central banks worldwide.They operate with complete legal immunity from national governments and taxation. Central banks themselves , like the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and others , print fiat currency at will, control interest rates, and manipulate economic conditions to serve the interests of the elite, not the public. Names like: These families accumulated obscene amounts of wealth through monopolies on banking, oil, railroads, and shipping during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries , and much of that wealth was quietly transitioned into trusts, holding companies, and offshore accounts. Estimates of the Rothschild family’s total wealth range from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars, though it’s nearly impossible to trace because it’s hidden in foundations, trusts, and behind nominal ownership. According to a study by the Tax Justice Network, the global elite hide $21 to $32 trillion in offshore accounts , in places like: This hoarded wealth escapes taxation, public scrutiny, and accountability. The U.S. government alone has been caught “losing track” of trillions: A handful of investment firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, now collectively own controlling stakes in: They also control massive real estate portfolios , quietly buying up farmland, housing, and critical infrastructure worldwide. The Vatican Bank holds untold billions in gold, real estate, and art. Documents have shown it profited from wars, colonial plundering, and financial schemes. Rumors persist about secret underground vaults loaded with treasures taken during centuries of conquest and conflict. Because it’s not idle money — it’s used to: And while the average person struggles with inflation, debt, and taxes , these entities hoard enough wealth to end global poverty dozens of times over. The idea of a global elite controlling humanity through debt, manipulation, and hoarded wealth isn’t a theory. It’s a fact that history’s empires have always functioned this way. The names and technology have changed, but the strategy hasn’t. And when the people finally see how it works, it falls apart. Every time. Since the 2008 crisis, four huge shifts take place that define the modern financial industry: Due to the strict regulatory policy adopted after the crisis, the post-2008 banking sector was uncompetitive relative to the pre-2008 banking sector, with the aggravating circumstance that the banks that survived the crash were buried in debt and deeply exposed in regards to their internal control mechanisms. In this context, the industrial sector sought for alternative, non-bank financing methods; namely private equity and alternative credit, with the latter occupying the power vacuum left by old-fashioned moneylenders that had been wounded by the housing market crash and the former constituting a revolutionary way of investing in company stock. Attention: The US is Facing The BIGGEST Threat Of The Century So pay chose attention because this video will change your life forever for the good! The most iconic finance job ever, the stockbroker, pretty much suffered its extinction during the 2008 crash. This opened the door for automated forms of investing in which the role of the intermediary – the broker – became trivial. Instead of investing on specific companies due to shareholder expectations of growth and performance, investors shifted towards large diversified funds listing hundreds of companies and tracking their growth over long periods of time. The vast majority of portfolios rarely list individual company stock anymore; instead you’ll find passive investments on the S&P 500 or similar indexes. The pre-2008 get-rich-quick culture came to an end long ago, with the exception of online quasi-scams and compulsive gamblers stepping out of casinos and into the stock market. Nowadays, equity investments are much more sober, striving for low returns on the short term, but large gains in the long run due to compound interest. This focus on long-term wealth planning is but a consequence of the overall lack of confidence in the solvency public pension plans – a very reasonable public sentiment that has grown especially amongst young generations and that has pushed them to rely on private retirement systems. While fee compression already democratized the access to the stock market, small investors were still excluded from alternative investments such as private equity and venture capital. With the rise of alternative credit (as detailed in point 1) private equity funds did not only lower their minimum capital requirements, but we also witnessed the appearance of “feeder funds” aimed at collecting cash from small investors in order to meet the capital requirements of actual private equity funds. In occasions, markets have even experienced feeder funds of feeder funds, or feeder funds creating ETF-like portfolios combining investments on several private equity funds, such as EQT. The financial sector is arguably a more mature sector due to developments taking place since the 2008 crisis. This is mainly due to automatization of middleman roles and thence a democratization of access to investment opportunities, a soberized portfolio management culture, the rise of non-bank financing methods, and a declining confidence in public pension plans. The Medical Research Scam (The most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times) First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE In the universe of alternative media, the immense size and influence of the Science/Medicine Industrial Complex (including “Big Pharma”) is well-known and commonly accepted. However, this massive network of organizations might be better understood as Big Research. A recent investigation dealing with UAB football (too embarrassing to cancel) led me to perform further research into the key source of funding for this university, the largest employer in the state of Alabama. The revenue UAB derives from scientific “research grants” awarded by the federal government is of a scale that boggles the mind of this citizen researcher. This examination of UAB funding sources should illustrate the massive amounts of money flowing from Washington D.C. – as well as various other medical foundations and private sources – into the coffers of certain higher education institutions that have leveraged allocations labeled “scientific research” into money-printing factories. In the past seven years, UAB – a public college of 23,000 students and 24,000 (!) employees – generated at least $5 billion in revenue from government grants, most coming from the federal government and most from grants bestowed by the National institutes of Health (NIH). In Fiscal Year 2022, UAB was the recipient of a “record” $774.5 million in federal grants and funding (source: al.com Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist John Archibald). You’ll Understand Everything After Watching This VIDEO! From 2018 through 2022, UAB received $3.178 billion in science research grants. Assuming annual funding levels were similar in 2023, 2024 and 2025, UAB has pocketed more than $5 billion in “research” money. According to an analysis published by the The Urban Institute in 2022, 37 percent of UAB’s operating revenues came from federal funding. Only two colleges in America – MIT (48 percent) and Johns Hopkins (42 percent) – received a larger percentage of their total income from the federal government. For context, every year UAB makes approximately twice the amount of revenue from federal grants as the university does from student tuition and fees. According to the school’s financial report from 2020, the school netted $244.93 million in tuition and fees in Fiscal 2020 and $484 million from “grants and contracts.” (Even tuition is federally subsidized, as nation-wide, 31.6 percent of students receive Pell Grants. I also learned that graduate students who help perform medical research are paid with federal dollars.) In 2022, UAB received $774 million in federal funding, more than double the $332.4 million it received as a legislative approproriation from the State of Alabama. The vast majority of UAB’s federal funding comes from the NIH, the parent agency of the NIAID, the sub-agency headed by Anthony Fauci through 2023. According to various sources, UAB received $413 million from the NIH in 2023 and $407 million in 2022. Indeed, the Alabama college is in the “top 1 percent” of colleges that receive grants from this agency. Also, the NIH is not the only “public health agency” that showers money on UAB. The same year the college received more than $20 million from the CDC and $11.5 million from the National Science Foundation. The college also benefits from “private grants and contracts,” which presumably come from “partners” in Big Pharma like Pfizer, NGOs and various foundations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, the University received $81.2 million from “private” grants, according to the 2020 CPA financial report. The school also derives income from patents and royalties on drugs and vaccines its faculty helped create. According to a UAB press release, “other growth areas include industry and clinical trials. Total industry awards, which include grants, funded trials and services, more than doubled (106 percent) since 2018 to exceed $150 million in 2022.” For further context, the amount of revenue UAB derives every year from federal funding and federal grants is at least $550 million more than the entire operating budget of Jacksonville State University, a four-year Alabama college with approximately 9,000 students. According to a Google AI query, 88 percent of the “medical research money” distributed to Alabama’s 34 four-year colleges went to just one university – UAB. The justification for the vast amounts of “research money” flowing into UAB coffers is that these investments “save lives” and improve the health of Alabamians and Americans. Indeed, earlier this year, an RFK, Jr. initiative at the HHS threatened to make “huge cuts to biomedical research grants” distributed to “research colleges” like UAB. According al.com columnist John Archibald, “several (UAB) professors and doctors privately were close to panic … wondering if they should pack their bags.” According to the all-important authorized narrative, possible cuts in medical research would result in horrific spikes in future deaths and unfathomable medical misery. To emphasize the requisite scare-mongering point, Archibald quoted Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. “…You’re either pro-Alabamian and American health or you’re not,” said Mayor Woodfin. “There’s no in-between here. And when you cut funding, you hurt not just employers, but you hurt the people who voted for you as it relates to the ability for life-saving medicine, period.” In one column, Archibald urged Alabama Republican senator Katie Britt to fight to protect “life-saving research” being conducted at UAB. Not surprisingly, Britt did just this, writing a letter to President Trump to “speed up the release of NIH funds to UAB.” According to Sen. Britt’s spokesperson Grace Evans: “Senator Britt has been a strong advocate for ensuring the NIH remains the gold-standard of research and innovation across the nation and the world. She has continued to express the need for taxpayer dollars … which includes funding life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.” According to Sen. Britt’s letter, “withholding or delaying these funds could undermine critical research; risk jobs supported by scientific research and delay Americans’ access to life-saving treatments.” Watch this video below to find out the great secrets hidden by the government. As a jaded, skeptical contrarian, I’m happy to challenge the entire “life-saving research” narrative. For starters, it should be noted for the record that every phD and medical researcher at UAB (like all “research” universities) was spectacularly wrong about Covid and the Covid response, including the necessity for “life-saving” vaccines. I recently published an article about a UAB faculty member who spent 400 words in a guest column telling citizens the novel coronavirus was largely spread from physical surfaces. My long-time readers also know that Anthony Fauci’s successor at the NIAID was Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, who graduated to this job after serving for years as the director of UAB’s highly-acclaimed Infectious Disease Department. While a revered and honored Birmingham resident, Dr. Marrazzo, like 99.9 percent of higher education experts, was wrong about everything Covid. Furthermore, she helped lead the safety trials for remdesivir (nicknamed “Run, Death is Near!”), a formerly FDA-rejected drug which was “researched” and “developed” by UAB and the NIH. According to many contrarians and ignored hospital whistleblowers, this “ground-breaking, life-saving” Covid “treatment” has killed thousands of American citizens. (One of UAB’s grants – for $37.5 million – was awarded to administer safety trials for this life-taking drug.) In researching this story, I found an article about another esteemed UAB faculty expert, Dr. Paul Goepfert, a “UAB vaccine expert.” In November 2020, Yellowhammer News ran a big story on this vaccine expert after Pfizer (a regular benefactor of UAB), reported its vaccine was “90 percent effective.” “That’s tremendous news,’ said Dr. Goepfert. “… The most optimistic of us were thinking about 70% effective, so 90% effectiveness is fantastic.” Goepfert advised … “if the Pfizer vaccine is indeed 90% effective, around 60% of the population would need to take the vaccine to achieve herd immunity.” Applying “follow-up journalism” to Yellow Hammer News’ glowing report, at least 60 percent of the population did get two doses of these “vaccines” and “herd immunity” did not happen. In fact, the vaccinated become much more likely to be infected once, twice or four times than the unvaccinated. When I think about the hundreds of billions of dollars distributed to research colleges like UAB, the conclusion I reach is that most of this money is being spent to develop new pills and new vaccines to treat medical conditions that aren’t getting better. Per my analysis, researchers identify a medical issue that’s allegedly causing a terrible medical condition, followed by Big Pharma rushing in to create and sell a new pill, which patients will have to take the rest of their lives. For example, researchers discovered that “high cholesterol” was the major risk factor for heart attacks and sold billions of Statins. (Also, the numeric definer of “high cholesterol” was steadily lowered). The same thing happened with blood pressure medications and anti-depressants, which half of the country now takes (including large percentages of teenagers, especially female teenagers). The nightmare depression risk is suicide, but the number of suicides have increased, perhaps because anti-depressants increase the risk of suicide. Colonoscopies – like breast cancer screenings – were supposed to be a life saver but all that happened is researchers encouraged citizens to start getting annual colonoscopies and mammograms at earlier points in their lives (when it comes to colonoscopies, “45 is the new 55.”) Like many research universities, UAB features an academic department devoted just to fighting infectious diseases. However, infectious diseases don’t show up on any Top 10 or Top 15 list of “leading causes of death.” Researchers tell us vaccines eliminated deaths from infectious diseases like chicken pox, measles and polio, but those death and illness numbers essentially vanished because of better sanitation. UAB is also famed for its cancer research. While the “war on cancer” has been waged my entire life, cancer deaths and diagnosis are higher than they’ve ever been. *** IMO, it’s entirely possible the vast Medical Research Complex has caused a net increase in deaths due to over-prescriptions and over vaccination. If the “research” is bad or dubious, the public would have been better off with no “ground-breaking, life-saving solutions” …all brought to the public by the army of scientists performing studies and experiments in NIH-funded laboratories. For those who think these comments are medical disinformation or blaspheme, my rejoinder is … try selling these “solutions” to the Amish, who don’t receive any of these shots or take any of these pills … and who are living to a ripe, healthy old age. As a final editorial point on the alleged importance of cutting-edge medical research, the world needs more contrarians who ask questions about all of the medical research that doesn’t take place at these universities. As this article documents, just one university in Alabama has received more than $5 billion in research grants and contracts in a few years. However, not one research dollar has been allocated to research the embalmers’ clots. No “ground-breaking, life-saving” research has told the public what’s causing these white, fibrous clots in tens of millions of people and what might stop them. Nor is UAB investigating or researching the source of the spike in cancer diagnoses or “turbo cancers.” If a prize was awarded for the most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times, it might be named in honor of Anthony Fauci, John D. Rockefeller or Bill Gates … and the Medical Research Complex would win this trophy every year. Lessons from the Economic Catastrophe of 1929 (Bank Failures Played a Crucial Role in Deepening the Economic Crisis) The Great Depression of 1929 stands as one of the most significant economic crises in modern history, casting a long shadow over the global financial landscape. Sparked by a catastrophic stock market crash in October, this era of intense economic turmoil led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest. In the United States, millions lost their jobs, homes, and savings, forcing families to confront an uncertain and often dire future. This article delves into the factors that precipitated the Great Depression, its profound impact on American society, the government responses that shaped economic policy, and the global ramifications of this devastating crisis. By understanding these aspects, we can glean valuable lessons that inform current economic practices and prepare us for future economic challenges. Watch the video below! The Great Depression did not arise in a vacuum; it was the result of a confluence of several factors that had been brewing throughout the 1920s. To fully understand the causes of the Great Depression, it is essential to look at the economic environment of the 1920s, commonly referred to as the “Roaring Twenties.” This period was marked by significant economic growth, technological advances, and an unprecedented rise in consumer culture. However, this prosperity was built on shaky foundations, and cracks were starting to appear. One of the primary catalysts for the Great Depression was the rampant speculation in the stock market. During the late 1920s, an increasing number of Americans began investing in stocks, often borrowing money to purchase shares in hopes of quick profit. This speculative bubble was characterized by inflated stock prices that did not reflect the actual value of the companies. The euphoria surrounding stock investments created an unsustainable market driven by the belief that prices would continue to rise indefinitely. Unfortunately, this led to an inevitable collapse when the bubble burst in October 1929, resulting in a dramatic stock market crash that sent shockwaves throughout the economy. Bank failures also played a crucial role in deepening the economic crisis. With the collapse of the stock market, many banks faced immense financial pressure as their clients rushed to withdraw their savings, fearing for their financial security. The banking system, which had become over-leveraged during the boom years, was unable to withstand the sudden surge of withdrawals. By 1933, approximately 9,000 banks had failed, wiping out billions in savings and further destabilizing the economy. The loss of confidence in the banking system exacerbated the financial crisis, leaving consumers with little access to credit and diminishing their ability to spend, which in turn led to decreased production and even more layoffs. International trade issues also contributed to the economic downturn. In an attempt to protect American industries, the U.S. government enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930, which raised tariffs on hundreds of imported goods. Although the intention was to bolster the domestic economy, the result was a significant decrease in international trade. Other nations retaliated by imposing tariffs on American goods, leading to a cascading effect of reduced trade volumes and increased economic isolationism. The combination of these protective measures further deepened the global economic crisis, proving counterproductive to the very goals they sought to achieve. Additionally, economic disparities and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few created an unstable economic environment. While the upper echelons of society reaped the benefits of the booming economy, a significant portion of the population struggled to make ends meet. This disparity in wealth led to reduced consumer spending, which is a vital component for economic growth. Without a robust consumer base, businesses struggled to maintain production levels, leading to layoffs and further economic contraction. In summary, the causes of the Great Depression were multifaceted and interconnected. The speculative practices of the stock market, bank failures, international trade barriers, and growing economic inequality all played significant roles in leading the world into one of its darkest economic periods. By examining these causes, we can draw lessons not only about financial prudence but also about the importance of a balanced economic system that supports all citizens, rather than a select few. The ramifications of the Great Depression extended far beyond economic collapse; they reshaped the social fabric of the United States. As unemployment soared, many families faced dire financial straits. By 1933, unemployment rates had skyrocketed to approximately 25%, leaving millions of Americans without jobs and many more struggling to survive on meager means. This widespread financial despair led to significant social challenges, including increased rates of homelessness, malnutrition, and mental health issues. The plight of the unemployed was visible in cities and towns across the nation. Shantytowns, often referred to as “Hoovervilles” after President Herbert Hoover, sprang up as displaced families sought shelter in makeshift huts. These communities became symbols of the suffering and hardship endured during this era. Families often found themselves living in extreme poverty, with many children going hungry or forced to drop out of school to support their families. The loss of a stable home environment had long-lasting effects on the health and education of these children, many of whom would experience generational poverty as a result. Furthermore, the Great Depression had a profound effect on the American psyche. The sense of insecurity and hopelessness permeated society, as people grappled with the loss of their dreams and aspirations. The stress of financial instability contributed to a rise in mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Families were torn apart by financial difficulties, with some individuals resorting to desperate measures, including theft or begging. The collective trauma experienced during this period would leave scars that echoed throughout psychological studies and societal dynamics in subsequent decades. Social movements also began to emerge in response to the crises created by the Great Depression. Workers organized strikes and protests, demanding fair wages and better working conditions. Labor unions became more prominent as workers sought to protect their rights in an increasingly volatile job market. For many, invoking the power of collective bargaining became a means of survival. This surge in labor activism ultimately contributed to significant changes in labor laws and workers’ rights in the years that followed. The Great Depression also prompted shifts in public attitudes toward government intervention in the economy. Prior to this period, many believed in a laissez-faire approach, where the government primarily took a hands-off stance regarding economic affairs. However, the scale of the crisis led many to advocate for a more active role for the government in providing support for those in need. This shift in public opinion laid the groundwork for future social safety nets and government programs that aimed to assist those facing economic hardship. In conclusion, the impact of the Great Depression on society was profound and multifaceted. The economic collapse not only led to widespread unemployment and poverty but also altered the way individuals viewed work, government, and their place within society. The lessons learned during this tumultuous time continue to resonate today, emphasizing the importance of social safety nets, economic equality, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! In the wake of the Great Depression, the U.S. government faced intense pressure to respond to the profound economic crisis that had gripped the nation. Under the leadership of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in March 1933, the government implemented a series of sweeping reforms and policies collectively known as the New Deal. These initiatives aimed to provide immediate relief to the unemployed, to stimulate economic recovery, and to implement lasting reforms to prevent future economic collapses. One of the cornerstone programs of the New Deal was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), established in 1933. This program aimed to provide jobs for young men while simultaneously addressing environmental conservation efforts. Participants in the CCC worked on projects ranging from reforestation to building parks and trails, enabling them to support their families while also contributing to national recovery efforts. By the time the program came to an end, millions of young men had benefited from the CCC, gaining work experience and developing skills that would serve them for a lifetime. Another critical aspect of the New Deal was the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA), which aimed to stimulate the economy by investing in large-scale public works projects. The PWA funded the construction of infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and bridges, creating jobs for thousands and laying the groundwork for future economic growth. These projects not only provided immediate employment but also contributed to long-term improvements in public services and infrastructure. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) was also established to provide financial assistance to states for direct relief programs. This initiative allowed states to distribute funds to those most in need, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations received support in a timely manner. FERA marked a significant shift in government policy toward direct intervention in alleviating poverty and provided a model for future entitlement programs. In addition to these relief programs, the New Deal included regulatory reforms aimed at stabilizing the financial system. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated commercial banking from investment banking, creating a barrier to limit risky financial practices that had contributed to the economic collapse. The establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought to regulate the stock market and protect investors from fraudulent practices, restoring public confidence in the financial system. Furthermore, the New Deal brought about reforms in labor rights with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) in 1935. This legislation guaranteed the rights of workers to organize, join unions, and engage in collective bargaining. This marked a significant shift in labor relations, as it provided a legal framework for workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions. The act resulted in a surge of union membership and empowered workers in their fight for labor rights. The New Deal also included social welfare programs, such as the Social Security Act of 1935, which established a social safety net for the elderly, unemployed, and disabled. By providing financial support to vulnerable populations, the Social Security Act marked a significant transformation in the government’s role in economic security, providing a foundation for the modern welfare state. While the New Deal faced criticism from various quarters, including conservative politicians and those who argued it expanded government power too far, the overall response to the Great Depression reflected a paradigm shift in how the government perceived its role in the economy. The efforts initiated under the New Deal laid the foundation for a more interventionist government and contributed to the eventual recovery from the Great Depression. In conclusion, the government’s response to the Great Depression through the New Deal was multifaceted and transformative. Through a series of innovative programs and policies, the government sought to address the immediate needs of a struggling population while implementing reforms to safeguard against future economic crises. The legacy of the New Deal continues to shape discussions around economic policy and the role of government intervention, highlighting the importance of adaptable responses in times of crisis. The Great Depression was not confined to the United States; its effects resonated around the globe, reshaping economies, societies, and international relations. As countries struggled with the fallout from the economic crisis, they faced unique challenges that often led to varying responses and policies. In Europe, the Great Depression had a devastating impact on economies already teetering on the brink following the devastation of World War I. Nations like Germany, which were grappling with the reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, experienced severe economic distress. Hyperinflation, massive unemployment, and social unrest became commonplace as economic instability eroded confidence in democratic governments. The dire economic circumstances contributed to the rise of extremist political movements, most notably the ascent of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Hitler’s regime leveraged the economic despair to promote its agenda, which included aggressive nationalism and expansionist policies. In the United Kingdom, the depression catalyzed significant political and economic changes. While initially, the British government adopted a hands-off approach, the rising levels of unemployment and growing public discontent eventually compelled leaders to take action. The Labour Party, which gained power in the 1929 elections, aimed to address the crisis through public works programs and unemployment relief. However, the severity of the depression led to the eventual formation of a National Government coalition in 1931, prioritizing economic recovery over socialist reforms and implementing austerity measures that included cuts to public spending. Countries in Latin America experienced backlash as well, particularly in relation to global trade patterns. Many nations were heavily reliant on exports of agricultural products, which suffered from the drop in demand during the depression. This economic hardship led to political instability, with some countries experiencing military coups as leaders exploited the social and economic unrest. For example, in Brazil, Getúlio Vargas rose to power in 1930 amid the tumult and initiated sweeping reforms to promote industrialization, which were partially in response to the weaknesses exposed by the Great Depression. In response to the economic calamity, some nations adopted increasingly protectionist policies, including high tariffs and import quotas. This drive for economic self-sufficiency often stifled international cooperation and trade, leading to an era of economic isolationism. Protectionism, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in the United States, not only exacerbated domestic economic problems but also fueled tensions between nations as retaliatory measures took hold. While the depression compelled some nations to pursue isolationist policies, it also drove others to collaborate on economic recovery efforts. The establishment of agreements like the London Economic Conference in 1933 reflected the recognition of the need for coordinated international action to combat the crisis. Unfortunately, the conference failed to produce meaningful results as countries prioritized their national interests over global cooperation. The global consequences of the Great Depression also led to significant shifts in economic thought. Many countries began to explore Keynesian economic principles, which advocated for increased government intervention to stimulate demand during economic downturns. John Maynard Keynes, an influential economist, argued that governments should increase spending during periods of recession to boost consumption and promote recovery, contradicting prevailing economic philosophies that emphasized balanced budgets and limited government involvement. In summary, the Great Depression reverberated across the globe, resulting in significant economic, political, and social fallout. While some nations descended into turmoil, others sought to rebuild and adapt in response to the crisis. The diverse responses to the Great Depression underscored the interconnectedness of the world economy and highlighted the importance of international cooperation in addressing complex challenges—a lesson that continues to resonate in current global economic discussions. The Great Depression left an indelible mark on economic policy and societal norms, shaping the way governments and institutions approach economic challenges to this day. Several lessons can be gleaned from this tumultuous period, providing valuable insights for contemporary policymakers and economists. One of the most critical lessons is the importance of timely and effective government intervention in times of economic crisis. The initial laissez-faire approach taken during the early stages of the Great Depression led to a catastrophic decline in economic conditions and widespread suffering. The eventual recognition of the need for government action—exemplified by the New Deal—demonstrated that proactive measures could mitigate the consequences of an economic downturn and support recovery efforts. Today, many governments recognize the necessity of employing fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate the economy during recessions, showing the enduring influence of lessons learned from the Great Depression. Another vital takeaway is the need for strong regulatory frameworks to maintain financial stability. The lack of oversight in the financial sector contributed significantly to the events leading up to the Great Depression, resulting in risky practices and rampant speculation. In the aftermath, reforms such as the Glass-Steagall Act and the establishment of regulatory bodies like the SEC were implemented to stabilize the financial system. Modern economies continue to grapple with the balance between regulation and free-market principles, underscoring the importance of a robust regulatory framework to safeguard against financial crises. The Great Depression also highlighted the dangers of economic inequality. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals contributed to volatility and limited the purchasing power of the broader population. Economists and policymakers today increasingly recognize that equitable economic growth benefits society as a whole and contributes to overall stability. Ensuring that wealth is distributed more evenly can create a more resilient economy, capable of withstanding fluctuations and crises. Furthermore, the importance of social safety nets became apparent during the Great Depression. As millions suffered from unemployment and poverty, the need for government-supported programs to assist vulnerable populations became clear. Modern social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance and food assistance programs, are grounded in the lessons learned from this historical event. These programs are critical to providing a measure of economic security and stability in times of hardship, ensuring that individuals and families are not left to navigate crises alone. Lastly, the Great Depression emphasized the interconnectedness of global economies. The ripple effects of the economic collapse demonstrated that no nation operates in isolation. Today’s policymakers must consider the impact of global trade, investment, and economic policies, understanding that collaboration and dialogue across nations are necessary to prevent similar crises from arising. Organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have emerged in part to facilitate international cooperation and provide support to countries facing economic challenges. In conclusion, the lasting lessons of the Great Depression continue to shape economic thought and policy today. The undeniable impact of government intervention, the necessity of regulatory frameworks, the importance of addressing economic inequality, the need for social safety nets, and the recognition of global interconnectedness are all crucial insights drawn from this period of crisis. As economies face new challenges in the 21st century, these lessons remain relevant, guiding policymakers to foster resilience and stability in the face of economic uncertainty. The Great Depression of 1929 serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of economic systems and the profound impact of financial crises on society. The confluence of factors that led to this catastrophic event, including stock market speculation, bank failures, and economic inequality, created a perfect storm that devastated millions of lives. The social, economic, and political repercussions of the Great Depression reshaped the American landscape, paving the way for government intervention and regulatory reforms that continue to influence economic policy today. From the establishment of the New Deal programs to the global responses that shape modern economic thought, the lessons learned during the Great Depression are invaluable. The importance of timely governmental intervention, the need for robust regulatory frameworks, the significance of addressing economic inequality, and the necessity of social safety nets cannot be overstated. Furthermore, the crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of the global economy, underscoring the importance of collaboration and communication among nations. As we navigate the complexities of today’s economic landscape, drawing on the experiences of the past can inform our approach to future crises. The resilience of societies in the face of adversity, coupled with the commitment to enacting meaningful reforms, can contribute to a more stable and equitable economic environment. The Great Depression reminds us that while economic challenges may arise, our responses can lay the groundwork for a more sustainable future for generations to come. This Shocking Video Will Completely Change Our World First Major Risks of a Cashless Society (New Update) According to- discoveryalert.com.au: The push for a cashless society represents more than just technological evolution—it’s a coordinated effort occurring at multiple levels of government, financial institutions, and corporations worldwide. This transition is reshaping how we interact with money and raising significant questions about financial freedom and privacy. The cashless society is a necessary step in preparation for the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast, btw, is a concept based on a couple of short passages from The Revelation (end of chapter 13 and start of chapter 14), which say that there will eventually be a one world government just before Jesus returns, and the spiritual leader of that government will cause people everywhere to get a mark put in their right hand or in their forehead, without which they will not be able to buy or sell. What we have used for centuries for buying and selling is cash (or checks). We have also progressed to credit cards. So all of these would need to be replaced with the mark, in order for the prophecy to come true. Is cashless society in World a bad step? Cashless Means Automatic If money is easy to spend, it is also easy to take. Convenience can easily become tyranny. Automatic payments that come directly from your bank account illustrate the point.) The convenience of digital money that allows you to spend your money more easily, also makes it easier for banks, governments and thieves to take it.The message to depositors is clear- when you put money in a bank you are a creditor of the bank and if it goes bust you are at the bottom of the list of creditors. Your money** will be seized as part of any approved plan, perhaps even before the broke bank files for bankruptcy. Your bank account can be raided by government authorities, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) without notice or reason given. If the IRS believes your bank account deposit and/or withdrawals activity is suspicious and/or may involve a pattern designed to avoid reporting requirements, they may seize your account. Think your money is safe in the bank? Think again. Digital cash a bit of Trap-it can be stolen.Think digital money is safer than cash and can’t be stolen? Some actually believe that in a cashless society that crime will go down and drug dealers will go out of business. Think again. In a cashless society, theft will occur on line and in far larger amounts than cash heists. An online thief never has to confront his victim, commit violence, crack a safe, get past an alarm system, dog or armed guards and carry away his loot. Rather, in a cashless society, the cyber thief merely has to hack the systems where the ‘money” is. The online heist involves no risk of death or threat to the thief’s personal safety and can be done from anywhere in the world. Without cash, the value of currency would have no independent value outside a functioning banking system to which you have access. Your money wouldn ‘work’ without a functioning banking system. If the banking system is down due to a power outage, solar flare, financial crisis, Internet failure, hack or network crash, your money is unavailable and potentially lost. If back up files are lost how do you prove you had $15,000 in your account? Even if the digital banking system was 100% fool proof, you may end up being shut out of the system for wrong doing (actual or alleged), bad credit or failure to pay banking fees. Or you may be the victim of identity theft and as a “precaution” your account may be closed. Without access to the banking system, how will you pay your bills and buy items you need? While going cashless may be convenient when you choose to buy something, but if a purchase is thrust officiously upon you by government order, your money can be removed from your account to pay for it, conveniently of course. This type of forced convenience results in a removal of freedom of choice of how you may wish to spend your money. Property rights are the foundation of a free society. If you don’t have control, ready access or the ability to spend your money when and as you please, you do not really own it.Rather, you are a co-owner with the currency issuer (the bank) who has veto rights over your use of the currency. In a cashless society there is the loss of privacy. Digital money offers the convenience of allowing you to track and budget your money online. Such a system, however, also leaves a permanent digital foot print of where you spent your money, accesible to just about anyone who has access to your account. (crimminal hackers and government agencies). A common objection to this privacy invasion is that “If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about”. Without cash, consumers are no longer market participants that evaluate tangible value based on how much cash they have in their wallets, but mindless spenders without a sense of the value of the items they are purchasing or a sense of understanding of their actual cost after incurring bank and credit card interest fees. (still sky high even after years of zero interest rate policies across the globe). In a society that uses cash, acts like making change and giving tips provide market participants with a tangible sense of economic value. Children that grow up saving money in piggy banks and counting their pennies, nickels and dimes learn the value of money through the tactil experience of handling money. A cashless society turns money and value into digital abstractions as defined and controlled by the banks and central planners. What to Own When the Dollar Collapses When it comes to preparing for an economic collapse, there are a lot of different schools of thought. Some people believe that stockpiling food and supplies is the best way to go, while others think that having a stash of cash on hand is the key to weathering the storm. But what if neither of those options is available to you? What if the only thing left to rely on is your own two hands? In this blog post, we are going to take a look at every possible solution for what to own when the dollar collapses. A part of this article is summarized in the following video: Precious metals like gold and silver have been used as a form of currency and store of value for centuries. In times of economic or political turmoil, precious metals are often seen as a safe haven asset. Investors typically turn to gold when they are worried about inflation eroding the purchasing power of their paper money holdings. Gold is also seen as a hedge against geopolitical risk. Silver, on the other hand, is more industrial in nature and is used in many different industries, from electronics to photography. As such, it can be more sensitive to economic trends. When considering investing in precious metals, it’s important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Each investor’s circumstances are unique and will dictate what type of investment makes sense. But for those looking for an alternative to traditional investments like stocks and bonds, precious metals may be worth considering. A few additional precious metals for your consideration: When it comes to foreign currency, there are a few different options that can be considered. Investing in foreign stocks could be a very wise move. After all, if the value of the dollar plummets, then the value of foreign stocks is likely to go up since they will be priced in stronger currencies. Of course, there are risks involved with investing in foreign stocks. For one thing, you may not be familiar with the company or understand how it operates in its home country. Additionally, political and economic conditions in other countries can impact your investment (think Brexit). That being said, here are a few foreign stocks that could be worth considering: When it comes to protecting your portfolio from a potential dollar collapse, there is an option to invest in foreign bonds. Foreign bonds can offer stability and diversification, as well as the potential for higher returns. There are a number of factors to consider when investing in foreign bonds, including inflation rates, interest rates, and political risk. Inflationary risks are particularly important to consider, as high inflation can erode the value of your investment. It’s also important to be aware of currency risks – if the value of the US dollar falls relative to other currencies, your investment will lose value (in USD terms). One way to mitigate some of these risks is to invest in foreign bonds with shorter durations – that is, bonds that mature sooner rather than later. This way you’re not exposed to as much interest rate or currency risk. Another strategy is to ladder your investments, which means investing in a series of bonds with different maturity dates, so that not all of your money is invested at once. Of course, no investment is without risk – but by diversifying into foreign bonds you can help protect yourself against the potentially devastating effects of a collapsing dollar. As a side note, keep in mind that a direct purchase of foreign bonds can be a highly challenging task. Try going through an exchange-traded fund or a closed-end fund to ensure a successful purchase. The following video from Kingcademy gives a crash course on foreign bonds: While gold, land, and various commodities propose a physical form of investment, you can diversify your assets by investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is often called “digital gold” because like gold, it is scarce (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence), durable (it can’t be destroyed or corrupted) and portable (you can carry millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin in your pocket). It also has similar properties to gold in that it isn’t controlled by any government or central bank. This makes it an appealing choice for people who are looking to protect their wealth from inflation or a potential collapse of the US Dollar. Other cryptocurrencies also offer similar benefits. Ethereum, for example, has been designed with the intention of being used as a global currency and platform for decentralized applications. This makes it different from Bitcoin, which was primarily designed as a digital store of value. However, both Bitcoin and Ethereum offer investors protection from inflation and the possibility of huge gains if they continue to rise in popularity and value. Collectibles can hold their intrinsic value even when the local currency loses its own value. Here are some things to consider collecting: Real estate is a solid option that shields you against the devaluation of the US dollar. Let’s review the reasons: For these reasons, investing in income-producing real estate should be considered by anyone looking to protect their wealth during an economic downturn. When the dollar collapses, land and agricultural commodities will be some of the best investments you can make. Here’s why: A major economical collapse might require more than just investing in precious metals and foreign currencies. There is a good chance you will need to live off the grid, away from your country’s control and infrastructures. Here are some things you can do to be prepared and survive: There is much more to learn about living off the grid, which is why I invite you to read my complete guide on off grid living. When the dollar collapses, barter items will become increasingly important. Here are some items that will be especially valuable. You will notice some similarities with the previous list, since both lists deal with items essential to your survival and independence. When it comes to investing in the face of an impending dollar collapse, there are a few key things you should keep in mind. First and foremost, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. Invest in a variety of assets that will hold their value even if the dollar does tank. Gold and silver are always reliable choices, but, as stated earlier, you can also look into investments like real estate or art. Another important thing to remember is that timing is everything. If you wait until after the dollar has already collapsed, it will be too late to invest. You need to get ahead of the curve and start investing now. The sooner you do, the better position you’ll be in when (or if) the bottom falls out from under the dollar. Finally, don’t panic! It’s easy to let fear take over when thinking about such a potentially catastrophic event as a currency collapse. But try to stay calm and rational; otherwise you could make some very costly mistakes with your investment portfolio. Stay safe and be prepared! First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE Hiroshima. Chernobyl. Nagasaki. Fukushima. They’re practically household names at this point. As such, most people know that the consequences of the radioactive fallout spread far beyond the borders of these towns and cities. What you may not realize, however, is just how far. In some cases, the consequences might seem trivial. Take, for example, the lack of salad greens throughout France for months following the Chernobyl disaster. Meanwhile, the black rain following the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were clearly devastating. In this regard, radioactive fallout can be elusive—taking a ruinous toll on some, while others are left seemingly untouched. Either way, the most important point to remember is that fallout is the inevitable result of practically any major nuclear event. It doesn’t matter whether you’re talking about a meltdown at one of the world’s 450 active nuclear facilities, a terrorist attack with a dirty bomb, or full-scale nuclear war: fallout will be a fact of life for anyone in the surrounding area. The silver lining? Radioactive fallout isn’t nearly as instantaneous, destructive, and unpredictable as a nuclear blast or meltdown. Indeed, it is something that you can prepare for—something you can work around and navigate your way through. Is It Legal To Go Off The Grid In Your State? In this video you will discover the most shocking things hidden by your government! So in this post, we’re going to take a deeper look at the nature of nuclear fallout and delve a bit deep into the chances of surviving a nuclear attack. This means we’re going to look at the science behind it, the basics of how fallout works, the situations that can arise, and the challenges you may face in the event of a nuclear disaster. We will also pay close attention to prevailing wind patterns and geography, allowing us to gauge how much radioactive fallout you would potentially be exposed to during a nuclear attack or disaster. And perhaps most importantly, we’re going to touch on a few basic things that you can easily do in order to prepare for—and ultimately survive—short-term exposure to nuclear fallout as you make your way to safety. For the roughly 100 million Americans living within the fallout zone of an active nuclear reactor, this could be an important read. So let’s get started… What few people appreciate, however, is the true magnitude of nuclear events—or the massive amounts of toxic fallout they can produce. After all, there are a few key things that nuclear bombs and meltdowns both do exceptionally well: Pulverizing matter over a wide area, nuclear events can create a tremendous amount of debris, ash, and particulates. These rapidly increase exposure for those in the immediate area—where the highest concentrations of fallout and radiation can be found. In a subterranean explosion, called a “base surge,” this phenomenon is even more pronounced—with an effect akin to that of an active volcano. Nuclear events irradiate this pulverized material, creating an unintentional but extremely toxic concentration of debris, dust, ash, and fallout—all while local residents are most likely seeking medical attention or escape. Finally, nuclear events propel the radioactive material into the stratosphere. In fact, in some cases, nuclear events can contaminate entire wind patterns with high concentrations of irradiated fallout. That’s how these events have lasting—albeit milder—effects hundreds or thousands of miles away. When it comes to determining the extent and volume of fallout following any particular nuclear event, there are two key factors to consider. First, there’s the location of the explosion. If it’s an airburst, then comparatively little fallout will be produced (but there will be a substantial EMP wave). However, if it’s a surface explosion, material will actually be pulled up into the nuclear cloud and irradiated before it’s carried along the plume into the upper atmosphere. Consequently, you might think an explosion over water would be more favorable—but that’s just not the case. You see, the explosion evaporates water and irradiates the remaining sea salt, producing much finer and smaller radioactive particles that can spread across a much larger area. This fallout can then seed clouds and rain back down on cities hundreds or even thousands of miles away. And it goes without saying that this fallout won’t simply wash off the outside of a building. Indeed, water surface bursts can even pulverize the sea floor. During the infamous Castle Bravo nuclear test, for instance, where a massive chain reaction was accidentally triggered due to the bomb’s peculiar construction, it was reported that calcinated white powder (pulverized coral) rained down on nearby boats. Subsurface bursts, meanwhile, become even more complicated, because the base surge they produce can flood the surrounding areas with lethal doses of radiation before the fallout even arrives. The second key factor is meteorological. Though it’s frightening to think that something as devastating as nuclear fallout is determined by the way the wind blows, that, we’re afraid, is exactly the case. This means that, due to the fine particulates produced by a nuclear blast, fallout can easily be carried over hundreds of miles in a matter of hours and days. Of course, the greatest intensity of the fallout is felt in the immediate area of the nuclear event, but radioactive materials can nevertheless spread far and wide due to its volatile nature. Part of this is accomplished through the animal kingdom. For livestock who graze in fields covered in nuclear fallout, for instance, their radioactive diet might prompt their extermination (as in Chernobyl). In other instances, however, they may spread the fallout further by carrying it in their fur, droppings, and bodies. Vegetation is a concern here, too. After all, crops can be dusted with fallout from an explosion hundreds of miles away, as was the case with the French salad greens mentioned above. These plants typically have to be safely destroyed to contain exposure. But ultimately, the nature of exposure, how it works, and what constitutes a lethal dose of radiation—these things are still widely debated and little understood. But, when it comes to fallout, there are a few things that can be said for certain: Fallout isn’t always predictable, it’s got devastating potential, and knowing what to expect can provide a crucial advantage at a time when most people will still be reeling. Facing the reality of a nuclear detonation (and the fallout that comes with it) might feel overwhelming to think about. With that said, it’s far from being a hopeless scenario. Consider Akiko Takakura, for example, who was just 300 meters from ground zero at the Hiroshima explosion but survived unscathed. Eizo Nomura, meanwhile, was even closer, at just 155 meters from the hypocenter. That means he stood less than two football fields from a nuclear explosion and still lived well into his eighties. This, of course, raises the question: how did they survive a nuclear bomb going off right on top of them while so many others perished? In reality, there are four key factors that will determine whether you’re safe from the fallout of a nuclear detonation or meltdown: As we’ll cover in just a moment, time is crucial after a nuclear blast. You’ll only have about fifteen minutes to seek sufficient cover, but radiation will die down to acceptable levels in most of the blast area after just a few days. Note that fallout is at its absolute worst in the first 72 hours, so it’s crucial to evacuate immediately or stay sheltered. After a few weeks, you’ll be able to make longer trips outside (if you haven’t yet evacuated). While there are a handful of cases like those mentioned above, close proximity to a nuclear blast and the immediate fallout tend to spell certain disaster. So while it makes sense to shelter in place during the worst of the fallout, your ultimate goal will be to put a safe distance between you and the bomb’s lingering radioactive effects. In an instant, the initial fireball and scorching thermal radioactive material of a nuclear detonation gives way to what’s called gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is notoriously powerful, able to penetrate inches of heavy material (even thick lead plating) and rapidly poison the body, so shielding can play a vital role in protecting you from radiation. Notably, both of the Hiroshima survivors mentioned above were underground in a shielded concrete basement, which was the key to their survival. Radioactive materials decay at different rates, which can affect everything from timing and distance to the amount of shielding needed to protect yourself. Here, it’s worth noting that each of these factors interacts with the others. So if you’ve got a robust enough shelter, you won’t have to worry so much about distance. Likewise if you enter an area weeks after the fallout has dissipated. In that spirit, let’s take a look at how you might really survive a modern nuclear event. First things first: if you’re exposed to a nuclear detonation or meltdown, it will be a hard thing to miss. You’ll either see it, hear about it on the news, take note of a special nuclear fallout alarm, or catch on as those around you react to what’s going on. In the first crucial minutes, your very first priority will be finding the best possible shelter nearby. This is because you’ll have about fifteen minutes or less to do so. Remember that cars provide absolutely no protection, and that any (indoor) shelter is better than being outside. Once you’ve found the right place, go to the deepest room inside it. You’re basically trying to put as many walls as possible between you and the outside world, even if that means holing up in a linen closet. Note that you’ll want to make sure you’re away from doors, windows, and anything else that might be exposed to the outside world. It’s even a good idea to tape up the cracks around doors and windows, to prevent particulates from seeping in. PRO TIP While we want to stress the importance and gravity of the information we’re presenting, we also want to establish some reasons as to why you should remain calm. Once you’re confident in your shelter, you’ll want to gather supplies. We’ll talk more later about which supplies are best to keep on hand (ideally you’ve got a bug-out bag), but you’ll want to lay hands on as much food, water, and other essentials as you can find without leaving your shelter. Once the fallout sets in, it won’t be safe to eat anything (even packaged food) from outside your shelter. It’s also a good idea to remove your outer layer of clothing, take a shower, if possible, and change clothes, as this ensures that you’re not wearing fallout in your shelter. The same holds true for any pets that were outside—give them a good wash to minimize radiation exposure. After that, waiting is the name of the game. Note that in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion, radiation levels will typically be extreme, and fallout will be at its worst. This is when you’re most likely to see effects like the black rain that came down on Hiroshima after the nuclear explosion there. Fortunately, the worst of this fallout will dissipate quickly. In some cases, radiation levels can drop from as much as 1,000 roentgens/hour to as little as 10 roentgens/hour in just the first three days. That’s why it’s so crucial to stay inside, away from windows and doors, during the entire first 72 hours. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! This is where a radio can come in handy, giving you a crucial lifeline to the outside world. After all, for the next 72 hours, you’re going to want to stay buried as deep as possible in your shelter while the intensity of radiation outside plummets to more liveable levels. After that, in many cases it should be safe for short trips outside. Of course, there’s no guarantee, as each nuclear event plays out differently. Regardless, by the 72-hour mark, you can start thinking about making your way to safety or at least assessing your surroundings. Here, it’s important to stress that even if the nuclear event doesn’t happen in your immediate area—even if it’s hundreds of miles away—the fallout could still potentially reach you in a day or less. So, even if you’re just watching the news or monitoring releases from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) about a nuclear event on television, don’t hesitate to start making preparations. To survive nuclear attacks and ensure minimal damage, it will take more than being lucky; you should prepare. When preparing for something like a major nuclear event (and the fallout that comes with it), you run the risk of preparing in a manner that’s either too specific or too broad to be truly helpful. So instead, it’s best to break things down to their components—then focus on doing the best job with each individual component. For example, it’s generally a great idea to stock up on food and water. This is especially useful in the event of nuclear fallout, because the more food and water you have, the longer you’ll be able to stick to your shelter and avoid the radiation outside. Ideally, you’ll want at least a two week supply of food and water on hand. If and when that food is depleted, you’ll need an escape plan to get you to safety. If you’re in a city, that might mean making it to the country. Or if you’re on the coast, it might entail driving to a family cabin in the mountains. Regardless of your exit strategy, it’s important to have one, whilst keeping a few backups in case things don’t go exactly to plan. Since any realistic exit strategy will have you leaving your home after a few days, weeks, or months, it’s prudent to stock up on hazmat gear as well. MIRA Safety’s HAZSUIT, CM-6M mask, and NBC-77 SOF filter all have a long shelf life and can be paired with Kappler chemtape, tough chemical-resistant gloves, and overboots for complete protection. While it might be tempting to save a few dollars on your hazmat gear, it’s important to remember that not all suits are created equal. Ultra-cheap suits, for instance, can easily be punctured, exposing you to dangerous elements. Military suits, meanwhile, feature carbon lining and breathable composition, but they can be prohibitively expensive or hard to find (something we’re working on improving). Our HAZSUIT, on the other hand, strikes a nice compromise between the two, with reliable puncture-resistant performance and an appealing price point. It’s also great to keep an emergency package around for storms, blizzards, hurricanes or tornadoes. That kit should include a crank-style emergency radio, basic first aid kit, matches, flashlights, and other basic utilities. Once again, these are all great tools to have on hand in case of nuclear war—especially the radio. Some folks will even go as far as to prepare a special fallout room/nuclear war shelter, reinforcing walls with wood, concrete, bricks, and sand to thicken barriers and cut down on possible radiation. While this might seem like overkill, a few minor considerations can actually upgrade an existing storm/hurricane shelter to something that would increase your odds of surviving a nuclear event. Plus, even just a few inches of barrier could provide much needed protection from the gamma radiation mentioned above. In the end, there’s a wealth of knowledge to consult online, and there are plenty of contractors who would be willing to work with you on a custom setup. Perhaps the most specific preparation for nuclear fallout should be in your bug-out bag. After all, you may be at work, school, or otherwise away from home when a nuclear event occurs—in which case a bug-out bag is a crucial lifeline to get you to safety. That’s why there are a few must-have items we recommend for everyone’s bug-out bag: Thyrosafe tablets are a cheap and easy purchase—and one of the items most likely to save your life. But how do they work? Well, these powerful pills flood your thyroid with safe iodine, enough to keep your system from absorbing any for the next 24 hours. This is crucial, because radioactive iodine (I-131) is a major factor in nuclear fallout, accumulating in your thyroid and rapidly poisoning the rest your body with radiation. One little pill, however, has the power to stop that process dead in its tracks. A reliable gas mask, like the MIRA Safety CM-6M or military-grade CM-7M full-face gas mask, is a bug-out bag must-have. Although dangerous radiation can pierce concrete with ease, radioactive particles can still be extremely dangerous, especially in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion. There might also be fires and chemical or biological elements in the environment. While a gas mask is only part of a larger system of personal protective equipment (PPE), it remains a staple, as it’s highly mobile, easy to carry, and can save your life in the right circumstances. To filter out that radioactive iodine, you’ll need a gas mask filter that’s reactor-rated. In this regard, the MIRA Safety NBC-77 SOF filter is a great choice, because it also provides protection against a number of other chemical, biological, and radiological threats while having a twenty-year shelf life and lightweight construction. Even if you’ve already got one at home, an emergency radio is well-worth the investment. After all, when hunkering down in a shelter, there’s a good chance that cell phones and standard phone lines will go down, but emergency radio broadcasts will let you know whether it’s safe to go outside. Note that these things cost just a few bucks, they’re compact, and they can be just as much of a lifesaver as the Thyrosafe tablets. Lastly, pack whatever else fits, including a hazmat suit and chemtape for sealing things up. Granted, these inclusions won’t necessarily be practical in most bug-out bags—indeed, it might be a better idea to just double down on your food supplies. Nonetheless, a hazmat suit and chemtape can be helpful for navigating the environment after you survive the first 72 hours. A gas mask, however, is a definite must-have, because it can be carried with ease and donned in a matter of seconds, while a hazmat suit can take substantially longer to deploy. Of course, this is all in addition to what you might already have in your standard bug-out bag—but it shouldn’t add too much weight. Note that MIRA Safety even offers a special package that includes a gas mask, filter, Thyrosafe tablets, and a drop-leg pouch to store it all. Regardless, these key preparations are easy to make—and potentially extremely useful in other situations as well (particularly in relation to the gas mask). We understand that the prospect of surviving the aftermath of a nuclear event is rather daunting. Hopefully, however, it seems a bit less overwhelming than it did just a few minutes ago. Make no mistake—it would still almost certainly be the single most challenging day of your life. And a variety of factors will inevitably remain well outside of your control. However, with a bit of careful preparation and consideration, you can vastly increase your own odds of surviving the nightmare of a nuclear explosion and attendant fallout. Remember: it’s all about those crucial first 72 hours. From the first fifteen minutes to those first three days, simple decisions could have massive consequences for your survival. So find the safest possible shelter, hunker down, and wait out the worst of the radiation. Granted, even after everything we’ve covered, even after preparation and planning, you’ve still got to be ready in case things go awry. So, what will you do if your primary shelter is suddenly out of the question? What if you don’t have a bug-out bag handy? Preparing for multiple contingencies with layered plans can further improve your chances of survival and help you adapt to challenges on the fly. Therefore, be sure to identify good shelter locations near the places you spend most of your time, and stock up on backups wherever possible.

Ethereum’s $200 billion tokenized economy, falling exchange supply and traditional finance footprint are fundamental factors that suggest ETH is undervalued. Key takeaways: Ethereum currently hosts $201 billion in tokenized assets, which is nearly two-thirds of the global total of $314 billion. Institutional growth led by BlackRock and Fidelity has driven a 2,000% surge in onchain fund AUM since 2024. ETH exchange supply hit a yearly low, hinting at investor accumulation and a stronger market floor. Ethereum's growing dominance in the tokenized asset landscape is reshaping how investors value its network fundamentals and its native token, Ether (ETH). As of Tuesday, tokenized assets across all blockchains amount to roughly $314 billion, with Ethereum accounting for $201 billion, nearly two-thirds of the market. This underscored its leading role as the most utilized settlement layer in crypto in 2025. Stablecoins continue to form the backbone of Ethereum’s network economy, representing the vast majority of transaction activity. Combined USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) issuance on Ethereum has sustained deep liquidity pools across DeFi, cross-border payments and exchanges, helping the network maintain one of the highest transaction throughputs in the industry. The expansion extends beyond stablecoins. Tokenized fund assets under management (AUM) on Ethereum has surged by nearly 2,000% since January 2024, driven by institutional entrants like BlackRock and Fidelity bringing traditional investment products onchain. Fidelity Digital Assets noted that, “beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, some of the most noteworthy developments in digital assets are happening in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).” The company highlighted that stablecoins have become a global medium of exchange, processing $18 trillion in volume over the past 12 months, even surpassing Visa’s annual throughput of $15.4 trillion. Meanwhile, RWAs have emerged as Ethereum’s fastest-growing category. Tokenized treasuries, funds and credit instruments on Ethereum now total $12 billion, representing 34% of the $35.6 billion global RWA market. Protocols such as Ondo, Centrifuge and Maple are fueling the surge by offering yields of 4%–6% on tokenized US Treasury exposure and secured lending products. Analytics platform Token Terminal noted that this expansion effectively anchors Ethereum’s $430 billion market capitalization to tangible onchain utility, noting that, “the market cap of tokenized assets on Ethereum has set the floor for ETH’s market cap.” Related: BitMine snapped up 34% more ETH last week as prices dipped Data from CryptoQuant pointed out that Binance, the largest Ether trading venue by volume, indicated that ETH exchange supply has declined sharply since mid-2025, hitting its lowest level since May 2024. After peaking in early summer, supply fell continuously through November, reaching about the 0.0327 level. This persistent outflow signals coins moving into cold storage or long-term wallets, a behavior typically associated with accumulation phases. Interestingly, this decline in exchange balances coincided with Ether’s price peaking near $4,500 to $5,000 in August and September before retracing to about $3,500 currently. Analysts noted that a reduced supply on exchanges tends to alleviate sell pressure, potentially setting the stage for price stabilization or renewed upside if investor risk appetite improves.

Investing Caterpillar (CAT) shares are up over 56% year to date. The company set a sales growth target of around 6% for the next four years. Caterpillar trades at more than 23 times forward P/E after its recent rally. Goldman Sachs (GS) is up over 36% year to date and more than 142% in the last two years. Goldman Sachs trades below 15 times forward P/E with a 2.0% dividend yield. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Scott Olson / Getty Images The Dow Jones Industrial Average offers too small a sample size for many to be an effective gauge of how well the stock market is doing on any given day. But, of course, we have the S&P 500 for that, which is more widely followed and invested in by investors. Still, having only 30 stocks in a basket does make the Dow an interesting and reasonably well-diversified portfolio that might act as a model for new investors looking to get started in the stock-picking game. Of course, the Dow Jones basket can be fun to keep tabs on as a beginner. And, of course, the index has a very rich history on Wall Street alongside a price that’s continued to swell, serving as an example of the wonders of compounding over extremely long periods of time. In any case, if you’re a fan of blue chips and are interested in when the legendary index adds a new holding or gives one the boot, you might be compelled to see what’s winning or losing in any given year. Though the year isn’t over yet, this piece will explore a few Dow stocks that have had their way with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (NYSEARCA:VTI), which are both up close to 15%, so far this year. But does their recent hot streak warrant chasing them into the new year? Let’s find out. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a heavy-duty construction machinery company that I found to be one of the most surprising market beaters for 2025. Shares of Caterpillar are up over 56% year to date, and despite recent turbulence, the rally off Liberation Day lows still seems intact. Wall Street analysts have high hopes for the $263 billion industrial blue chip going into 2026, especially after the firm revealed some pretty upbeat targets during its latest Investor Day meeting. Could Caterpillar really be in for a renaissance of growth over the next four years? Perhaps. A sales growth rate of around 6% seems easily doable, especially as buyers better appreciate its digital technologies. That said, the business of construction, mining, and all the sort can be quite cyclical. And with that, investors had better have a tolerance for pain should the environment shift drastically. If a recession is encountered at some point down the road, the rosy sales guidance may be too high a bar that’s been set. Either way, I’m cautiously optimistic about the name while it’s trading for more than 23 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). I could be wrong, but I think much of the optimism and strength might already be priced in here. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is up over 36% year to date, but more impressively, it’s up more than 142% in the last two years. The iconic investment bank really is firing on all cylinders, thanks to tons of dealmaking momentum, which is expected to carry into the new year, as well as continued resilience in the economy. If M&A looks to kick things up a few notches, the good days for Goldman Sachs might be about to get even better. In any case, the stock looks way too cheap at less than 15 times forward P/E, with a nice and growing 2.0%-yielding dividend.

Title: Bitcoin Slips Toward $103K; Miners Tumble on AI Trade Cooling, SoftBank's Nvidia Exit

Monday's rebound in crypto markets quickly unwound on Tuesday with bitcoin BTC$101,596.85 slipping back to $103,000. After briefly topping $107,000 overnight, the largest cryptocurrency fell to $102,900 during U.S. hours, down 2.5% over the past 24 hours. The drop erased the gains fueled by President Donald Trump's "tariff dividend" plan and rising optimism the U.S. government shutdown is about to end. Ethereum's ether ETH$3,420.93 fell 2.3% to below $3,500 and large-cap altcoins such as Solana's SOL SOL$153.30, XRP$2.3492 and SUI$1.9800 dropped 4%-5%, marking a broad retreat across digital assets. The selling extended into crypto-related equities, especially among bitcoin miners positioned as infrastructure plays in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. CleanSpark (CLSK) dropped 8%, Hut 8 (HUT) fell nearly 9% and Core Scientific (CORZ) tumbled 11.5% in the early session. TeraWulf (WULF) and Bitdeer (BTDR) also booked double-digit declines. The sector-wide weakness stemmed from a roster of firms reporting weaker-than-expected earnings and growth outlook in a sign that the red-hot AI infrastructure trade, driven by lofty expectations of demand for increased computing capacity, is due for a correction. Cloud computing provider CoreWeave lowered its next quarter outlook, citing delays in data center development, sending its stock 15% lower to the weakest level since early September. TeraWulf reported weak earnings and BitDeer posted deeper-than-expected losses and delay in its next-generation ASIC chips. Rounding up the negative headlines was Japanese investment bank SoftBank selling its entire stake, worth $5.8 billion, in chipmaking giant and AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA), driving the world's most valuable company's stock 3.5% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 0.7%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3%. Also this morning the ADP reported that U.S. private employers cut an average of 11,250 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Oct. 25, signaling a deteriorating labor market. The CME FedWatch tool now prices a roughly 67% chance of an interest-rate cut at the Federal Reserve's December meeting, while Polymarket sees it slightly higher at 72%. With Tuesday's tumble, BTC has now filled the so-called CME gap formed over the weekend. The gap occurs when bitcoin futures traded on the CME, the preferred marketplace among U.S. institutions, opens higher or lower than where it closed the previous session. BTC revisiting these gaps in price is often seen in market behavior, though not all gaps are necessarily filled, CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten noted. While the overall sentiment on crypto markets has improved the past few days as BTC and ETH bounced from the lows, traders are using the rebound as an opportunity to take profits across the board, Jasper De Maere, an OTC desk strategist at trading firm Wintermute, wrote in a Tuesday note. "When it comes to alts, the theme is still profit taking into strength, leading to short lived outperformance," he said. "Consensus is building that majors need to move higher first." Bitcoin is still holding it's trading range between $100,000 and $110,000, still consolidating, Paul Howard, senior director at trading firm Wincent, told CoinDesk. "If we see US macro improving with the shutdown ending, the $100,000 floor should stay intact for $BTC, he added. UPDATE (Nov. 11, 16:50 UTC): Adds analyst comment. Updates prices.

Title: Analyst Says Don’t Get Left Behind As Massive Liquidity Wave Is Coming For XRP

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A crypto analyst known as Pumpius has issued a bold warning on social media platform X, declaring that a massive liquidity wave is about to sweep through global markets, and XRP could be the key asset positioned to capture it. His post, shared alongside a chart of the US national debt now above $38 trillion, argues that a combination of government stimulus, monetary easing, and corporate spending is about to unleash a surge of capital unlike anything seen since the 2020 pandemic. In his analysis, Pumpius highlighted that the United States government is preparing to inject over $400 billion in new stimulus payments, and this is going to be the first direct round of such spending since 2021. This comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates despite inflation still sitting above 3% and labor market data showing signs of cooling. A similar setup in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an enormous wave of liquidity that lifted both traditional and crypto markets to record highs. Now, President Donald Trump has vowed to provide each American a $2,000 dividend to be distributed from what he said was tariff revenue. The chart shown below illustrates a notable connection vividly: each major stimulus injection, from the $270 billion to $410 billion rounds, coincided with sharp jumps in the national debt and subsequent market expansions. With total US debt now projected to exceed $38 trillion, Pumpius believes another round of liquidity growth is close. The analyst went on to point out that this time, the liquidity wave is not just based on government spending but also on private-sector investment on an extraordinary scale. The so-called Magnificent 7 technology companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) are collectively pouring over $100 billion every quarter into artificial intelligence infrastructure. According to Pumpius, all this incoming liquidity needs a bridge, an asset capable of settling large-value transactions instantly across borders. He described XRP as the only digital asset designed precisely for this purpose, built for institutional-grade, real-time settlement and capable of handling global capital flows efficiently. Ripple’s technology already provides the financial infrastructure necessary to connect banks, fintechs, and payment systems that will need to move funds quickly as liquidity expands. “The math is simple,” he said. “The liquidity is coming. The rails are ready. Own XRP or be left behind,” he concluded. XRP is one of the top-traded digital assets by volume, and market participants are watching closely to see how the cryptocurrency’s price action plays out. Ripple, its parent technology company, has been making different partnership moves and company acquisitions to expand its reach. This is expected to hopefully boost XRP’s adoption on a global scale and, in turn, its price growth. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.45, down by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Investor angst over Big Tech’s AI spending spills into bond market
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/11/11/investor-angst-over-big-techs-ai-spending-spills-into-bond-market/
Time Published: 2025-11-11T16:17:12Z

Investors have been selling off the debt of US tech heavyweights, showing how jitters over Silicon Valley’s boom in spending on artificial intelligence have spilled into the bond market. A basket of bonds issued by so-called hyperscalers – companies that are building vast data centres, including Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle – has sustained a hit in recent weeks. The spread, or premium in yield that investors demand to buy the debt over Treasuries, has climbed to 0.78 percentage points, the highest level since US president Donald Trump sent markets reeling in April with his tariff plans, and up from 0.5 points in September, according to Bank of America data. The widening spread highlights how investors are increasingly concerned with the way tech groups are turning to debt markets to finance their investments in AI infrastructure. “The important thing the market woke up to in the past two weeks is that it’s the public markets that are going to need to finance this AI boom,” said Brij Khurana, a fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management. JPMorgan on Monday said building AI infrastructure would cost more than $5 trillion (€4.3 trillion) and “will likely require participation from every public capital market as well as private credit, alternative capital providers and even government involvement”. The mammoth scale of investment in AI infrastructure has raised concerns about overcapacity, long-term profitability and energy demands. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta will spend more than $400 billion on data centres in 2026, on top of more than $350 billion this year. Tech groups are issuing debt at a quick rate to fund their AI expansion efforts despite having large cash hoards, which is something some investors worry could signal a shift to higher levels of leverage. “The hyperscalers collectively hold [about] $350 billion in liquid cash and investments and are expected to generate [roughly] $725 billion of operating cash flow in 2026,” JPMorgan said. “Even so, substantial new debt supply is coming to the credit markets from these high-quality issuers.” In recent weeks, Meta, Alphabet and Oracle have hit markets with blockbuster debt packages, some with maturities as long as 40 years. Meta last month forged a $27 billion private debt deal with investors, including Pimco and Blue Owl Capital, to fund development of its “Hyperion” data centre in Louisiana. It raised an additional $30 billion in bonds at the end of October, the biggest corporate bond deal since 2023. Meanwhile, Alphabet sold $25 billion of bonds in early November, $17.5 billion of which were raised in the US and $7.5 billion in Europe. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to fund infrastructure leases such as OpenAI’s “Stargate” data centre in Abilene, Texas. Analysts noted Oracle’s debt has been hit particularly hard in recent months. An index compiled by the Financial Times tracking its debt that has been trading since before the latest bond sale has fallen almost 5 per cent since mid-September, compared with a price fall of about 1 per cent for a broad Ice Data Services basket tracking US high-grade tech debt. Oracle has about $96 billion of long-term debt, according to Bloomberg data. It has rapidly grown its debt balances as part of a series of deals to lease computing power to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which the US software group said would generate $300 billion in revenue over the next five years. But credit rating agency Moody’s has flagged significant risks from Oracle relying on large commitments from a small number of AI companies to fund its growth. Smaller companies at the heart of the AI boom have also been hit. Data centre operator CoreWeave’s stock has fallen more than 20 per cent over the past two weeks, alongside the drop in bigger names. On Tuesday, the company’s shares were down a further 14 per cent after it lowered its forecast for annual revenue as a result of expected data centre delays. The cost to protect against a default on CoreWeave’s debt has jumped as the equity price has fallen, with the group’s five-year credit default swaps trading at 505 basis points, from below 350bp at the start of October, according to LSEG data. Some analysts argue that the decline in hyperscalers’ bonds in the wake of such large issuance is healthy. “As long as we are still pricing incremental risk, it’s a good sign. The thing I worry about is a rally on more supply rather than a sell-off,” said George Pearkes, a macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. “We’re still in early innings in this debt cycle for AI,” he said.

The announcement follows Netflix’s introduction of a new audience metric last week, reporting more than 190 million active monthly ad-supported viewers. Prime Video now reaches an average of more than 315 million ad-supported viewers each month globally, according to figures released by Amazon. The streaming giant introduced advertising in the UK in February 2024 and first reported audience data in April of that year, when its monthly ad-supported reach stood at 200 million. Prime Video now reaches an average of more than 315 million ad-supported viewers each month globally, according to figures released by Amazon. The streaming giant introduced advertising in the UK in February 2024 and first reported audience data in April of that year, when its monthly ad-supported reach stood at 200 million. Amazon says the 315 million figure represents an unduplicated average monthly active ad-supported audience across Originals, licensed series and films, live sports, events and free ad-supported live channels on Prime Video. The estimate is based on internal data collected over 12 months from September 2024 to August 2025, with some variations depending on launch dates. Over the past 18 months, Prime Video has rolled out advertising in 16 markets, including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the US.What Amazon’s 14,000 layoffs reveal about AI’s grip on marketing Prime Video Advertising’s vice president Jeremy Helfand describes this number as a “transformative milestone” for the streamer. “This expanded audience across 16 countries demonstrates our customer-obsessed approach to enhancing the viewing experience while delivering powerful opportunities for brands,” he says. The announcement follows Netflix’s introduction of a new audience metric last week, reporting more than 190 million monthly active viewers (MAV) globally for its ad tier. Netflix defines MAV as members who have watched at least one minute of ads in a month, multiplied by the estimated average number of people per household. Netflix said it hopes the MAV metric will become an industry-wide standard, noting that streaming platforms currently lack a universal measure for ad reach.Netflix hits 190 million monthly ad viewers according to new metric Separately, Amazon today (11 November) announced the international expansion of its AI-powered video generator tool to advertisers in the UK. The tool lets advertisers create “high-motion” videos from product images, existing videos or Amazon product detail pages. For example, a brand could create a video of a watch on someone’s wrist or a toy being actively played with by uploading an image of the product. In the US, where the feature launched in June, Amazon says more than 60% of products promoted with the video generator had never been advertised on the sponsored video page before. In the third quarter, total ad revenue across all of Amazon jumped 24% year-on-year, reaching $17.7bn, outpacing other tech giants, including Meta, Google and YouTube. AI is taking jobs from marketers in areas such as SEO and ad production, but the challenge remains the same: make yourself irreplaceable by creating value. Marketing Week’s weekly round-up of the technology stories that impact the marketing sector: from AI to martech, regulation to public perceptions. Amazon’s ad ranks in the top 7% of all ads this month, according to the latest The Works study. Cheez-It became the biggest launch in its category in four years, when it launched last year. Owner Kellanova has ambitions in the long-term to create an “iconic” brand in the UK. UK marketers are more likely to be “fully confident” in their abilities with AI, but there remains a gap between application and training. New research from LinkedIn’s B2B Institute and Ehrenberg-Bass urges B2B marketers to focus on being findable as much as being memorable.

A man placing coins with growing tree with white up arrow of financial developments and business growth</a> (<a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/license" target="_blank" style="100%">Shutterstock.com</a>) by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/Sichon" target="_blank" style="100%">Sichon</a> If the headline yield today is not something you’re concerned with, and you pay more attention to how fast a yield can grow, then it’s worth buying dividend stocks you can forget about for decades. By the time you cash out, stocks like TSMC (NYSE:TSM), Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) may snowball fast enough to beat the broader market significantly. As with any strategy, there are pros and cons to keep in mind. The most significant disadvantage is that things become highly unpredictable when you stretch out your time horizon decades into the future. To account for this disadvantage, you should only put your money into blue-chip dividend growth stocks. The advantage of investing in dividend stocks with snowballing payouts is that it can keep you ahead of the broader market over the long term. For example, a stock that yields 2% and grows its dividends by 10% annually could compound to a 35% yield on cost at year 30. The following three dividend growth stocks can make that happen. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, has been a major beneficiary of the semiconductor boom. Most semiconductor companies, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are actually fabless companies, meaning the manufacturing is done by TSMC. Many investors overlook just how much pricing power and importance this one company holds over the entire tech industry today. This is why TSM stock is perhaps the best way to play the AI game long-term. It doesn’t matter if Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), or some other company dominates the future AI chip industry. Rest assured, TSMC is likely to be the one manufacturing these chips. The company is in the process of building plants in Arizona to ensure that it can survive any Taiwan-specific shocks while lessening any future tariff impacts. TSM is already exempt from paying chip tariffs. Hence, I see it as a safe long-term stock to hold if you want snowballing dividends. TSM comes with a trailing dividend yield of 1.09%, but the five-year dividend growth rate is at 11.28% annually. The payout ratio is also very low at 4.88%. If TSM were to distribute 20% of its earnings as dividends, the dividend yield would approach 4.5%. EPS is expected to grow from $10.35 in 2025 to $15.6 in 2027. So, even a constant payout ratio of 5% can lead to solid dividend growth here. Fastenal is an industrial supply company that specializes in fasteners, tools, and related products. FAST stock has been one of the most reliable and dependable long-term names, and the growth trajectory has been highly predictable. That said, it is currently undergoing a cooldown, as the stock has retreated by 19% from its peak of $50. It is still up 15% year-to-date, and it remains in a strong long-term uptrend. Thus, I see no reason to be bearish here. In fact, the discount gives you a great entry point. You get a 2.15% yield with a five-year dividend growth rate of 11.84% annually. EPS is expected to grow at ~10% annually for the foreseeable future, and the ongoing push to onshore and reindustrialize America could lead to more positive surprises down the line. Novo Nordisk is in the toughest spot compared to the two other stocks in this list, but it also gives you the most opportunity. The weight loss market is huge, and the rising tide is likely to lift all boats in the long term, including Novo Nordisk. NVO stock is down nearly 58% over the past year due to slowing demand for Ozempic and Wegovy. Novo Nordisk also cut its full-year 2025 growth guidance four times. It now expects sales growth of 8% to 11%. The company also abandoned its $10 billion bid for Metsera. On the flip side, the stock looks very cheap at these levels. You’re paying less than 13x forward earnings now for a company with significant long-term potential. The market for weight-loss drugs remains huge, and it retains a larger market share in Europe, where it is based. This is a good buy-the-dip opportunity if you want to buy and hold for decades. You get a juicy 3.78% dividend yield to sweeten the deal. The five-year dividend growth rate is 21.57% annually, and the payout ratio is at 52.39%.

Business The logo of SoftBank Group Corp is displayed at SoftBank World 2017 conference in Tokyo, Japan, July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato SoftBank Group's $5.8 billion sale of its Nvidia stake jolted stock markets on Tuesday, stoking fears that the frenzy around artificial intelligence may have peaked, especially after recent warnings from Wall Street bank chiefs and a famed short seller. In its quarterly results, the Japanese tech investor said it had sold all the 32.1 million Nvidia shares it held in October to bankroll CEO Masayoshi Son's sweeping AI push, built around his "all in" bet on ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. SoftBank needs the proceeds for initiatives including the $500 billion Stargate project to expand U.S. data-center capacity and as much as $40 billion funding pledged to OpenAI, whose financing details were not given with the announcements. But the timing of its sale deepened some investor doubts that valuations in the AI industry might have gotten ahead of fundamentals.

Loading Nvidia shares were down more than 2 per cent in early trading, weighing on the benchmark S&P 500 index. Adding to the jitters was a revenue forecast cut from AI cloud provider CoreWeave over a contract delay that sent its stock down 9 per cent.Drumbeats of an AI bubble grew louder in recent weeks after Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs CEOs warned equities could be heading to a drawdown, while hedge fund manager Michael Burry, known for shorts on the U.S. housing market ahead of the 2008 crash, bet against Nvidia and Palantir.Several analysts said the sale suggested Son - one of tech's most audacious investors - sees the blistering rally that turned Nvidia into the first $5 trillion company last month cooling after a more than 1,200 per cent surge in the past three years.But a few of them pointed to SoftBank's patchy record managing its Nvidia holdings. The company, by some estimates, missed out on a more than $100 billion rally in Nvidia shares by selling it off in 2019 before the AI boom took off, only to later buy the chipmaker's shares again. "As for timing, cannot say Masayoshi Son has been great with his trading of Nvidia shares," said C J Muse, senior managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald. "It appears simply resource allocation – finding funds to make bets elsewhere."OPENAI FOCUS, SON'S GROWING WARCHESTAlong with the Nvidia share sale, SoftBank sold around $9.2 billion worth of shares in T-Mobile, providing Son with a larger money chest to stamp his influence on an industry hungry for the capital and chips needed to fund the pursuit of AI technology that can match or surpass human intelligence. "By cashing in now, he's securing the capital needed to double down on his conviction in AI applications and the super-scaled infrastructure behind them, OpenAI, Oracle and the Stargate project," said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors. But the rising bet on OpenAI also ties SoftBank, which has taken massive losses on its Vision Fund investments, closer to the startup at the center of a series of circular deals that have fueled worries about the bubble. The Japanese company's stock, which has surged more than twofold this year, is getting priced more and more based on its exposure to OpenAI.The stock jumped last month on news of a sweeping OpenAI restructuring that frees the startup from its non-profit roots. The startup is considering a $1 trillion public listing as soon as next year, which could be a big windfall for investors such as Microsoft and SoftBank, Reuters has reported.The rising valuation of OpenAI also boosted SoftBank's second-quarter net profit, which more than doubled. But OpenAI has not given any clear details on how it plans to fund its AI infrastructure deals that total around $1.4 trillion. It expects to finish the year with $20 billion in annual recurring revenue and recently walked back comments on need for government-backed loans."The Vision Fund's checkered past certainly lends an air of high-stakes poker to this divestment," Schulman said.

"The Vision Fund's checkered past certainly lends an air of high-stakes poker to this divestment," Schulman said.

The Japanese conglomerate is redirecting capital toward OpenAI, even as the ChatGPT maker faces mounting losses and its CEO's credibility comes under fire. The Tokyo-based firm disclosed the complete exit from Nvidia in its financial filing Tuesday, revealing that it and an asset management subsidiary "sold all of Nvidia Corporation shares that they had owned, for $5.83 billion." The move came alongside a $9.17 billion partial sale of its T-Mobile stake, part of an "asset monetization" to fund a $40 billion investment in OpenAI by year-end. The sale comes as Wall Street questions whether AI infrastructure spending will pay off and as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman faces scrutiny for publicly denying he sought federal loan guarantees just days after his company explicitly requested them in a letter to the White House. SoftBank's Vision Fund posted a blowout investment gain of $23.4 billion (¥3.54 trillion) for the quarter, $14.3 billion (¥2.16 trillion) of which came from marking up its OpenAI holdings to a pre-money valuation of $260 billion. The gains helped the company more than double net income to $19.3 billion (¥2.924 trillion), up 190.9% from the previous year. The Nvidia sale marks SoftBank’s second exit from the chipmaker, after an initial $4 billion stake bought in 2017 and sold in early 2019. The group later re-entered before offloading its position again in October. To finance its OpenAI investment, SoftBank issued $4.1 billion (¥620 billion) in yen bonds, $4.2 billion in foreign debt, and arranged bridge loans of $8.5 billion for OpenAI and $6.5 billion for ABB Robotics. "As SoftBank's investment in OpenAI was very large the company had to use its existing assets to finance new investments," the firm’s Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said in a press briefing, as cited in a CNBC report. SoftBank agreed on March 31 to invest up to $40 billion in OpenAI, with $30 billion of its own capital, with $10 billion funded in April and $22.5 billion set for December, according to the filing. The robotics acquisition aligns with SoftBank’s stated mission to “realize artificial super intelligence (ASI) for the advancement of humanity,” focusing on AI chips, robots, data centers, and energy, and investing in leading generative AI firms, according to the filing. SoftBank’s sale of its Nvidia stake is a “strong, but hugely unexpected, move away from hardware and toward AI projects and the data that fuels them,” Jiahao Sun, CEO of decentralized AI platform FLock.io, told Decrypt. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Nvidia's main supplier, posted 16.9% revenue growth for October, its slowest pace since February 2024. Short-seller Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management disclosed bearish wagers on Nvidia last week, even as Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft plan to collectively spend over $400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dipped 1.46% in pre-market trading after closing at $199.05, while SoftBank Group (SFTBY), which ended the prior session at $72.40 up 2.74%, was little changed before market open, according to Yahoo Finance data.

Title: Warren Buffett’s last shareholder letter offers 5 lessons for CEOs and warns that ‘envy and greed walk hand in hand’

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. The U.S. celebrates Veteran’s Day today, and we are sending a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has served. Speaking of gratitude, Warren Buffett dropped his ‘farewell’ letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders yesterday and offered a master class in introspection, recognizing his own good luck, and passing on sage advice. I’d highly recommend reading the letter in its entirety, but here are a few lessons for leaders I think are worth underscoring: Curb Your Envy: “What often bothers very wealthy CEOs—they are human, after all—is that other CEOs are getting even richer. Envy and greed walk hand in hand. And what consultant ever recommended a serious cut in CEO compensation or board payments?” Learn From Failure: “Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes—learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve.” Measure Success Through Impact: “Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.” Ponder Your Legacy: Buffett talks about how FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, once revered by Americans in the 1930s, “became disgraced for misusing his post.” His advice: “Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it … You will never be perfect, but you can always be better.” Bet on America: “Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management. Don’t despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Softbank offloads Nvidia Softbank on Tuesday sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia, pocketing $5.8 billion in a surprise move. Masayoshi Son’s company more than doubled its quarterly net profit thanks in large part to its bet on OpenAI. Shutdown may ease A splinter group of Democrats joined Senate Republicans in passing a measure to reopen the government on Monday night. The legislation now goes to the House, which is expected to take it up no later than Wednesday. Meanwhile, flight cancellations and delays spread amid a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay. President Trump on Monday threatened to “dock” the pay of any controllers who take time off. CoreWeave results AI data-center and infrastructure operator CoreWeave nearly doubled its revenue backlog to $55.6 billion, surpassing a critical Wall Street benchmark, though its debt increased and it revised down its full-year revenue guidance. Investors are following CoreWeave closely since it could be “a potential canary-like indicator of weakness in the AI ramp-up,” Fortune’s Amanda Gerut reports. Turmoil at the BBC The crisis at the BBC deepened on Monday after President Trump threatened to sue the broadcaster for $1 billion over the erroneous editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021. Two BBC executives have already resigned over the matter; the president has demanded an apology and compensation for “harm caused.” The real cost of Trump’s tariff dividend President Trump’s proposed $2,000 tariff dividend for all Americans (excluding “high income people”) will cost more than twice the revenue generated by tariffs, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found. The extra cost would have to be added to the already ballooning federal deficit. UBS economists’ labor market concerns UBS economists in their latest “US Economics Weekly” note compared the national labor market to a bathtub that is losing water (total jobs) as layoffs persist and the flow of jobs slows. “That is a material risk to the outlook,” the investment bank wrote.

Title: What Amazon’s 14,000 layoffs reveal about AI’s grip on marketing
URL: https://www.marketingweek.com/amazon-layoffs-ai/
Time Published: 2025-11-11T06:42:31Z
Full Content:
AI is taking jobs from marketers in areas such as SEO and ad production, but the challenge remains the same: make yourself irreplaceable by creating value. Amazon’s decision to cut 14,000 jobs this quarter – roughly half the number initially feared – confirms what most boardrooms already know: artificial intelligence isn’t just a productivity tool, it’s a restructuring driver. Forget the polite language about “culture” from CEO Andy Jassy or “people and customers” from HR chief Beth Galetti. The driver is efficiency. Investors want AI-level margins, not human-level headcount. And Amazon isn’t the outlier. Nestlé plans to remove 12,000 white-collar roles over the next two years. Salesforce has already replaced 4,000 customer people with the rise of AI agents. UPS has shed nearly 50,000 jobs since 2024, citing machine learning. Agency Dentsu has trimmed 3,400 worldwide. Not all job losses are liked to AI or marketing – but many are. Check your LinkedIn feed and you’ll see the fallout: marketers, analysts, planners – ‘open to work’. Marketing Week’s 2025 Career & Salary Survey captured that unease across the industry. (If you haven’t already, do your profession a favour and take part in the latest survey before 21 November.) The pattern is clear. AI is collapsing the space between strategy and execution – the white-collar layer where much of marketing, operations and customer service used to live. The search-optimisation industry – worth billions globally – exists largely to please algorithms, not customers. As users move from classic search to AI search with Perplexity, ChatGPT and Claude, traditional SEO will fade. It’ll be replaced by a new layer of ‘generative engine optimisation’ (GEO) equally detached from customer value, perhaps just more automated. Posting, scheduling and A/B testing across Meta and TikTok are already automatable. The ‘digital native’ roles created in the 2010s – once seen as the new frontier – are now the first to go. The irony: the generation that disrupted traditional marketing is now being disrupted by its own tools. Routine copywriting and influencer work are being commoditised fast. Virtual influencers have already fronted campaigns for beauty brands like L’Oréal offering perpetual, low-cost exposure – without mood swings, agents or scheduling conflicts. The majority of consumers cannot tell – or do not care – that the presenter isn’t human. Coca-Cola’s first AI-generated classic Coke caravan holiday commercial marked a turning point. Writing on X, Gravity Falls creator Alex Hirsch captured the industry’s unease: “FUN FACT: @CocaCola is ‘red’ because it’s made from the blood of out-of-work artists!” The Verge, meanwhile, described Coke’s latest 2025 AI Christmas ads as “a sloppy eyesore”. But it’s early days and the shift is inevitable. I once flew 30 people to South Africa for 30 seconds of beach footage. If AI can render 50 versions of the same ad overnight, be my guest. Mondelez just spent $40m on generative video platforms promising to halve production costs. In that kind of math, efficiency always wins the budget battle. Good news. AI may bring rigour to an area marketers have long avoided: measurement. The excuse that “it’s too complex to track” is eroding. AI-driven attribution and modelling could finally give the industry what it has lacked for decades – a standardised way to diagnose growth and prove ROI. For a discipline often allergic to evidence, there’s a cultural reset coming. I’ve read 20 corporate layoff memos this quarter. Beyond AI, they all mention “less critical roles” and “unnecessary layers”. Context matters. European GDP (the UK included) will grow just over 1% this year; the US a tad more. Across most markets, budgets are tightening. In that climate, CEOs are asking one question with increasing regularity: does this role contribute to growth? If the answer is unclear, the role is at risk. I’ve said it for years – if marketers don’t stand for growth, they stand for nothing. Growth is the reason marketing exists. Yet large parts of the discipline still retreat into comfortable abstractions of ‘brand love’ and ‘storytelling’. In a world where CEOs get more serious about growth, those arguments won’t survive the meeting. Ask: what are my company’s top three priorities? What are my customers’ top three priorities? The overlap is where growth happens. That’s the value creation zone. Maybe a competitor has a better product. Maybe your pricing’s off. Maybe your media strategy is underpowered. Whatever your job description says, if you operate inside the value creation zone – and make that visible – your role will be relevant. Which parts of your job could AI do better or cheaper? If large chunks can be automated, they will be. You can’t out-AI AI. Replace yourself before someone else does. Let machines handle the routine while you trade up to what they still can’t do well: judgment, creativity and the courage to ask questions no dataset can answer. AI will add mediocrity – at scale. Boston Consulting Group ran a revealing experiment: two groups solved the same marketing problems; one using AI, one without. AI helped the group perform 40% better in a product innovation task but resulted in 41% less diversity of ideas. Machines replicate knowledge; they can’t generate intuition. AI makes average things for average people (hello, Mico). Great marketers work on the edges – where ideas still feel slightly dangerous. Very soon, every marketer will face their own ‘Matrix moment’ – accept automation’s illusion of control, or take back the job of creating growth. Here’s the choice: Take the blue pill, and hand over your marketing to the machines (Meta and co are building that version of the future). Take the red pill, and step up as a growth leader who uses AI as leverage. The choice is existential. In the AI economy, marketing rainmakers stay. Everyone else may become optional. Amid wider strategic shifts, some B2B firms are experimenting with new senior roles in an effort to “redefine” marketing. Emotion and vulnerability are celebrated in advertising, but often lacking in leadership. It’s a double standard marketers must stop ignoring. Marketers who see brand building as an end in itself are mistaking the work they do for the results it delivers. New research from LinkedIn’s B2B Institute and Ehrenberg-Bass urges B2B marketers to focus on being findable as much as being memorable.

Title: Job cuts hit 22-year October high as retail layoffs from Amazon to Target mount ahead of holidays

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This story was first published by Digiday sibling Modern Retail. U.S. firms announced the most job cuts for any October in more than 20 years, fueled in part by mass layoffs at major retail companies. Employers slashed 153,074 jobs last month, up 175% from a year earlier, according to a Thursday report from global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. October’s total marked the highest for the month since 2003, driven largely by cost-cutting, though artificial intelligence ranked as the second-most cited factor. Year-to-date layoffs were already at their highest level since 2020 before the heavy downsizing that occurred last month. Retail has been one of the hardest hit industries this year, behind only warehousing and non-profits. So far in 2025, the sector has announced 88,664 job cuts, a 145% increase from the 36,136 recorded through October last year. The cuts come after a series of large-scale reductions across the retail industry. Amazon announced plans last week to eliminate 14,000 corporate roles as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s effort to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy. Target, meanwhile, shed 1,800 white-collar positions amid slowing sales. Other consumer-facing companies such as Starbucks and UPS have pared back staff in recent months. “There was an enormous amount of hiring that happened in that post-Covid period in retail, and retail is facing some other specific issues,” Andrew Challenger, workplace and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told Modern Retail in an interview. “Tariffs, immigration and persistent inflation — all of that can be affecting retail in ways that are causing [retailers] to have to make strategic changes.” All told, the wave of layoffs has cast a pall heading into the peak holiday shopping season, retail’s busiest time of year. It’s been a tough year for the industry thanks to stubborn inflation, bleak consumer sentiment and President Donald Trump’s trade war — the U.S. average tariff rate is at its highest level since 1934, according to The Budget Lab at Yale University. Retail’s corporate belt-tightening ahead of the holidays underscores the pressure consumer companies are under to drive sales and maintain profitability in a tough economic climate. “Retailers are simply trying to do more with less,” said Sky Canaves, a retail analyst at eMarketer. The timing of October’s layoffs is particularly striking given how close they are to the holiday shopping season. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October,” Challenger said in the report. “With the onset of social media, and the ability for workers to share their negative experiences with their employers, the trend of announcing layoffs before the holidays — a practice that seemed particularly cruel — fell away.” Retailers are also pulling back on holiday hiring. Companies are expected to add fewer than 500,000 seasonal positions this year — the lowest since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Several retailers, including Kohl’s and Target, have declined to disclose their 2025 seasonal hiring plans, a departure from previous years. Some companies plan to keep the seasonal hiring levels unchanged from 2024. Amazon said it plans to hire 250,000 workers for the peak holiday season, while Bath & Body Works announced plans to hire 32,000 workers, the same as last year for both companies. “While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge,” Challenger said. He added that seasonal employers are contending with a mix of challenges this year, including lingering inflation and tariffs. As such, companies are increasingly relying on automation and permanent staff over large waves of seasonal hires. “It’s not that people aren’t going to stores — foot traffic isn’t expected to fall much — but with fewer staff, the quality of the consumer experience could suffer.” EMarketer’s Canaves warned that leaner staffing could become a self-fulfilling cycle. “When shoppers have bad experiences in stores because they can’t get sales help or the lines are too long, they’re less likely to return,” she said Still, expectations for consumer spending power during the holidays offer a glimmer of hope. The National Retail Federation projects U.S. holiday sales will surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2025, rising 3.7-4.2% over last year. EMarketer’s own forecast is slightly more conservative at $1.369 trillion, up 3.6% year-over-year. Canaves said the outlook remains solid because “people keep spending even if they have to borrow or use payment plans like buy-now, pay-later to do so.” But that spending strength is increasingly uneven. “We’re kind of seeing a K-shaped consumer economy, where upper-income consumers are spending more and lower-income consumers are spending less,” she said. Amazon’s latest layoffs mark the company’s most sweeping since 2022. The tech and retail giant more than doubled its workforce during the pandemic, expanding from roughly 800,000 employees in 2019 to more than 1.6 million by 2021 to meet surging e-commerce demand. Challenger, Gray & Christmas’s recent report flagged cost-cutting and artificial intelligence as the primary drivers behind the October layoffs. However, Amazon CEO Andy Jasy told analysts on a quarterly earnings call last week that the e-commerce giant’s latest layoffs were about “culture,” not finance or AI. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, … you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy said. Reducing those layers is all part of Amazon’s mission to operate “like the world’s largest startup,” he added. While the cuts affect everything from software engineering to video games to advertising, retail management roles were hit hardest, according to internal data cited by Business Insider. That may reflect a broader sea change within Amazon, as its retail business now accounts for just 40.5% of total revenue, down from 60% in 2018, per e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse. Target’s restructuring followed a similar rationale. The company previously told Modern Retail its decision to cut roughly 1,000 team members and leave another 800 roles unfilled was meant to speed up decision-making rather than save money.“ The complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer and incoming CEO, told employees in an email the company provided to Modern Retail. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” The real issue is measurement: without a clear way to separate agentic visitors from humans, some buyers are getting jittery — and a few are already pulling ad spend. There’s a tone shift in publishers’ Q3 earnings: focus on video, direct audiences and AI licensing to offset search-driven ad revenue declines. Daily Mail’s clickthroughs drop 80–90% when Google AI Overviews appear, but traffic impact remains minimal due to strong direct traffic.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: AppLovin’s AI-fueled surge and The Trade Desk’s stumble show where investors are placing their bets

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → AppLovin and The Trade Desk emerged as the clear attention-grabbers in this ad tech earnings window — but for very different reasons, and with very different signals about how investors are reading the sector’s future. AppLovin stock, FTW AppLovin’s third-quarter numbers were the kind that usually end an argument. Revenue jumped 68% year over year to $1.4 billion, with net income and adjusted EBITDA growing even faster as the company leans into its AXON-driven advertising platform and shrinks its legacy gaming footprint. The market’s reaction was briskly positive, as the company’s stock popped (see table below). However, what makes that reaction stand out is what it seemed to ignore. Just a month earlier, a Bloomberg report revealed that the U.S. SEC was probing AppLovin’s data-collection practices, following short-seller allegations that it skirted platform terms to squeeze more targeting out of Meta and mobile ecosystems. The stock fell about 14% on that headline in October, and further coverage detailed how the company shut down an “Array” product that had become a focal point of those accusations. Yet when the Q3 numbers hit, Wall Street effectively compartmentalized the regulatory overhang, although, some analysts explicitly advised caution: growth forecasts point to a deceleration from the current breakneck pace, and the SEC probe is still unresolved. But for now, the combination of scale, margins and AI narrative appears to outweigh the governance red flags in investors’ models. Big Tech vs. The open web Meanwhile, The Trade Desk’s Q3 tells a more nuanced tale about sentiment toward the demand side of the ecosystem. The company delivered $739 million in revenue, up 18% year over year (22% excluding U.S. political spend), beating consensus and continuing its long streak of double-digit top-line growth. CTV outpaced the rest of the business, and video now accounts for roughly half of revenue, underscoring The Trade Desk’s role as the de facto DSP for the “open internet.” And yet, the stock fell 4–7% in the wake of the results, depending on which post-earnings snapshot you look at. Coverage framed it as a classic “great quarter, high bar”: the company beat on revenue and EPS, guided Q4 to at least $840 million, but is still working off a bruising summer reaction to its Q2 earnings. On the company’s subsequent earnings call, CEO Jeff Green again insisted Amazon isn’t a direct competitor because most of its ads target owned-and-operated inventory rather than the “open internet.” However, investors appear split on that framing, with some seeing an independent DSP with durable CTV and retail-media momentum; others worry that Big Tech and retailer networks can squeeze the open web on both inventory and data. The Q3 sell-off doesn’t signal that the market has “given up” on The Trade Desk — but it does show that continued backing for the sector’s flagship DSP now depends on more than just beating the quarter. The story investors are buying has to reconcile competition from Amazon, Google and retailer media with a credible path to sustained 20%-ish growth and healthy cash generation. Collaboration across the middle layers of ad tech is another trend investors are monitoring, and while not explicitly raised on the call, the fact that concerned parties are seeking a “grand bargain” to end months, if not years, of sniping over supply-path and auction mechanics is likely welcome. Against that backdrop, The Trade Desk and PubMatic — which reported its own Q3 earnings as Digiday was going to press (see chart) — announced a new API-based integration for deal-ID campaigns using The Trade Desk’s Price Discovery and Provisioning, or PDP, API. Observers have characterized the move as a pragmatic reset: both sides acknowledge that legacy deal-ID plumbing is too brittle for modern CTV and curated marketplaces, and are willing to align on common pipes to keep spend flowing. For markets, deals like this suggest that even when buy- and sell-side rhetoric turns heated, the largest players will still cut operational truces where there’s real money on the table. In a sector where investors have been burned by opaque auctions and fee stacks, cleaner integrations that promise more predictable yield and fewer failed deals are a modest but meaningful de-risking signal. ‘Death of the open web’ narrative The other axis driving valuations is how convincingly companies can connect AI to revenue — and how quickly they can prove it on the open web, not just in pitch decks. DoubleVerify’s Q3 is a case in point. Revenue grew 11% to about $189 million and margins remained robust, but sales came in a touch light versus some expectations, and Q4 guidance implied high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth. The stock promptly dropped around 19%. On the company’s earnings call, DoubleVerify leaned hard into its new DV AI Verification suite: Agent-ID to classify LLM agents and bots, and “AI SlopStopper” to detect and block synthetic or manipulated media across the open web. Management framed AI not just as a risk but as a margin lever, arguing that generative tools can 20x–2000x labeling productivity while opening new revenue lines in social, CTV and LLM-mediated advertising. Analysts pressed on how quickly those innovations could move the growth needle, and DV sketched a medium-term goal of taking social, streaming TV and AI verification from under 30% of revenue to roughly 50%. The share-price reaction suggests investors believe the strategy, but aren’t yet prepared to pay up for it without clearer acceleration. Elsewhere, Teads, provided the cautionary mirror image. Its Q3 revenue came in around $319 million, missing expectations and down roughly 15% year over year on a pro-forma basis, with EPS swinging to a loss — and the stock slumped by about 30%. On its earnings call, management laid out a turnaround plan targeting $35 million in annualized EBITDA improvement and highlighted CTV and AI-driven initiatives as the growth engine. Analysts focused heavily on how quickly Teads could stabilize core markets like the U.S., U.K., and France and whether its AI and CTV bets would stem share loss to rivals. The verdict from Wall Street — at least for now — is that execution risk is high, with the highly leveraged 2024 deal that led to the union of Outbrain and Teads, plus the “death of the open web” narrative, dragging down its stock price. In total, the above developments from last week point to a more nuanced view of ad tech’s prospects, rather than the blanket enthusiasm (or cynicism) of past cycles. On one side are scaled platforms such as AppLovin and The Trade Desk, which can still post high-teens to high-double-digit growth, invest aggressively in AI and CTV, and throw off substantial cash. On the other hand, there are infrastructure and media players that must prove AI is more than a cost line — that it can deepen moats in measurement, verification, and curated inventory rather than simply compressing margins. “Every player is optimizing for their own incentives instead of the health of the ecosystem. And somewhere in that noise, publishers — the ones creating the content and context that make advertising possible — are being left out.” – Renowned industry consultant, Jana Meron, of Lioness Strategies, says the quiet part out loud. News Corp explores multi-LLM licensing playbook News Corp is scoping out the potential for a multi-licensing LLM portfolio strategy, according to sources familiar with the matter. Ranking is out, visibility is in as publishers chip away at AI search optimization The AI search era is rewiring the goal from ranking to visibility, and publishers are slowly but steadily tuning their playbooks. Inside Bayer’s ad tech and data strategy to find new customers and prepare for agentic AI Bayer is bringing its custom algorithm in-house so it can be more hands-on with the model that undergirds its programmatic ad placements, working with Chalice and Snowflake to achieve this aim. Google is helping WPP build Websites for AI search engines Google is giving WPP-owned agencies access to tools that help marketers better appear on AI search engines, including Google’s AI Overviews and rivals such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Perplexity. ID5 acquires TrueData, combining strengths to create the most comprehensive ID solution Financial terms of the deal were not publicly disclosed, but the U.K.-based company states that by bringing TrueData’s graph on board, the company is upping its U.S. operations and strengthening its Adaptive Identity technology. The DOJ and Google sharpen their remedy proposals as the two sides prepare for closing arguments Both sides filed new post-remedy trial briefs on Monday, with the DOJ and Google each citing the phrase in support of their conflicting viewpoints on a potential divestiture of Google’s sell-side ad exchange. At a time when media careers are often measured in months rather than years, the editorial director is something of an anomaly. While Netflix’s intention was more transparency and clarity over reach methodology, marketers aren’t yet confident in how accurate it really is. Shifts of this scale always create winners and losers. The task for agency bosses is making sure they’re on the right side of that line.

The company recorded a consolidated operating revenue of Rs 2,474 crore during the quarter, a 5 per cent decrease as compared to Rs 2,616 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. Borosil Renewables on Tuesday posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 61.57 crore in the September quarter, aided by reduced expenses.

The growth was attributed to demand in passenger cars and off-highway segment.

Title: CoreWeave’s earnings report highlights $56 billion in contracted revenue, but its guidance and share price tick down amid AI infrastructure bubble fears
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/10/coreweave-earnings-infrastructure-debt-ai-bubble/
Time Published: 2025-11-11T01:22:49Z
Full Content:
Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. CoreWeave needed a lot of things to go right on Monday as it released third-quarter financial results, and one of the most critical was showing that its contracted future revenues could hit a $50 billion target Wall Street had set as a benchmark for the AI data-center and infrastructure operator. In its announcement, CoreWeave confirmed it nearly doubled its revenue backlog, which includes “remaining performance obligations” (RPOs) and other amounts it estimates will be recognized as revenue, to $55.6 billion, up from $30 billion the previous quarter. The surging backlog, which represents future revenues from customers, was driven by contracts with Meta, OpenAI, and French AI startup Poolside. Earnings and revenue, meanwhile, both beat analysts’ consensus estimates. The company also reported an increase in the debt on its balance sheet, however, and it revised its full-year revenue guidance downward. Following its earnings release and call with analysts, the stock dropped 6% in after-hours trading. Some investors have trained a gimlet eye on CoreWeave as more skeptics kick the tires of the booming AI trade and the concurrent infrastructure buildout. Concerns about CoreWeave, which some see as a potential canary-like indicator of weakness in the AI ramp-up, and about the AI build-out in general have sent the stock on a journey that has seen it tumble more than 30% from mid-August highs. The downward revision in revenue guidance reflected delays in construction of some of CoreWeave’s data centers. “While we are experiencing relentless demand for our platform, data center developers across the industry are also enduring unprecedented pressure across supply chains,” CEO Michael Intrator said during the analysts’ call. “In our case, we are affected by temporary delays related to a third-party data-center developer who is behind schedule.” Chief financial officer Nitin Agrawal offered full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $5.05 billion to $5.15 billion, down slightly from the guidance Intrator offered on the second-quarter earnings call, of between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. The customer impacted by the delay agreed to adjust the delivery schedule and extend the expiration date, Intrator said, which means CoreWeave will maintain the total value of the original contract. Agrawal said the company’s 2025 capex spending would be between $12 billion to $14 billion, down significantly from the $20 billion to $23 billion Intrator forecast last quarter. However, Agrawal said CoreWeave expects 2026 capex to soar. “Given the significant growth in our backlog and continued insatiable demand for our cloud services, we expect capex in 2026 to be well in excess of double that of 2025,” Agrawal said. CoreWeave reported revenues of $1.4 billion for the quarter, up from $584 million in the same quarter last year and beat analysts’ estimates. Profitability, at least by traditional GAAP measures, remains elusive. CoreWeave reported a net loss of $110 million, although it was an improvement over its $359.8 million loss in the third quarter last year and also better than analysts expected. Adjusted net loss, which shows financial performance without extraordinary items, was $41 million for the quarter compared to the same quarter last year when it was break-even, Agrawal said. Adjusted EBITDA, which shows earnings without certain one-time expenses, were $838 million in the third quarter, compared to $379 million in Q3 2024. Operating income, a metric that shows profit from core businesses, fell to $51.9 million, compared to the same quarter last year when it was $117.1 million. Operating margins shrunk to 4% from 20%. Meanwhile, adjusted operating income, which shows a different view on core business performance, was $217 million for the third quarter, compared to $125 million in the third quarter of 2024, said Agrawal, the CFO. CoreWeave’s third quarter adjusted operating margin was 16%, due to higher revenues, lower costs, and the timing of data center deliveries from third parties. While Monday was just this side of positive for CoreWeave, analysts who are bearish on the AI cloud computing company remain leery of its finances. They see the company as at risk of being overwhelmed by the significant financial commitments it has taken on to build out data centers, which currently look disproportionately large compared to its revenues and cash flow. Based on its latest earnings release, CoreWeave has $9.7 billion in bills due within the next 12 months on its balance sheet, and a total of $14 billion in current and longer-term debt. Last quarter, those figures were $7.6 billion and $11 billion, respectively. CoreWeave also has $34 billion in scheduled lease payments on contracts that will commence between now and 2028. Interest expense reached $311 million for the quarter, nearly triple the figure from the year-earlier period, of $104 million. CoreWeave bulls, meanwhile, remain confident that revenues from the company’s book of contracts will eventually far outstrip its debt obligations. During the past three months, CoreWeave has announced a spate of significant deals, booking a $14.2 billion deal to provide Meta with computing capacity and an agreement with Poolside for a data center with 40,000 of Nvidia’s coveted GPUs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: CoreWeave’s stock wavers on data center delay and lower revenue forecast

UPDATED 18:36 EST / NOVEMBER 10 2025 by Mike Wheatley Artificial intelligence compute infrastructure company CoreWeave Inc. delivered better-than-expected financial results today, but its stock lost ground after-hours when it revealed a tepid revenue forecast and said one of its third-party developers has fallen behind schedule on a key data center facility. The company reported a third-quarter loss before certain costs such as stock compensation of 22 cents per share, easily beating Wall Street’s estimate of a 40-cent-per-share loss. Revenue for the period rose by an impressive 134%, to $1.36 billion, also surpassing the analysts’ target of $1.29 billion. The increased revenue had the effect of narrowing CoreWeave’s net loss considerably to just $110 million, down from a $360 million loss in the year-ago period. CoreWeave Chief Executive Michael Intrator (pictured) said the company’s results are a reflection of its disciplined execution across every part of its business. “CoreWeave’s position as the essential cloud for AI has never been stronger as we drive growth through focus and innovation to power the next generation of AI,” he added. The fortunes of CoreWeave are tied directly to those of the AI industry, because the company specializes in renting out access to Nvidia Corp.’s graphics processing units and has secured numerous multibillion-dollar deals with key cloud infrastructure providers such as Microsoft Corp. and Google LLC. The company said its backlog stood at $55.6 billion at the end of the quarter, with 2.9 gigawatts in power under contract, up from 2.2 gigawatts three months earlier. The company made some big announcements during the quarter, notably including a $6.5 billion expansion of its partnership with OpenAI Group PBC. It also signed a new, six-year deal with Meta Platforms Inc. that could ultimately be worth up to $14.2 billion, along with another contract from an undisclosed “leading hyperscaler.” Despite the progress on the deal front, Intrator told analysts on a conference call that the company remains “supply-constrained.” He explained that the problem has to do with partly completed “powered-shell” data centers where the company intends to set up its own infrastructure. Intrator also admitted that one of the company’s third-party contractors has fallen behind schedule. He told analysts that the delay in construction won’t impact the company’s backlog, because the customer affected by the holdup has agreed to adjust its delivery schedule. The original value of the contract will be maintained, he added. “There was a problem at one data center that’s impacting us, but there are 32 data centers in our portfolio,” Intrator pointed out. However, one problem with that delay is that it’s likely going to hurt CoreWeave’s near-term fortunes. The company offered a full-year revenue forecast of between $5.05 billion and $5.15 billion, below Wall Street’s target of $5.29 billion. CoreWeave has enjoyed a wild ride since going public on the Nasdaq in March, when it sold its shares at a price of $40 each. The stock closed at $105.61, representing a gain of more than 165%, only to fall almost 6% in late trading today. Still, it continues to outperform the Nasdaq by a long way, with the broader index up just 32% over the same period. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research praised CoreWeave, not only for its “outstanding growth” but also for proving the many skeptics in the AI industry wrong, as it made great strides towards profitability. “Its earnings-per-share loss improved considerably, and with another quarter like this it should be in the black,” the analyst said. Having demonstrated it has a viable business, CoreWeave now needs to focus on carefully managing its growth, the analyst believes. “The focus has to shift to following the supply chain, delivering more data center capacity and running customer workloads successfully,” he said. “At the moment, it does face some challenges, with delays in one of its data center build outs, and this will need to be addressed.” Despite its impressive progress, CoreWeave has had its share of disappointments. Last month shareholders of the data center infrastructure company Core Scientific Inc. voted to decline a $9 billion acquisition offer, claiming it was undervalued and didn’t recognize its growth potential. CoreWeave chose not to increase its offer, and so the deal has been terminated. “We respect the decision of Core Scientific’s stockholders regarding our previously announced merger agreement,” CoreWeave said in a statement. “Our partnership with Core Scientific remains strong and will continue to execute on shared growth opportunities. CoreWeave’s vision and strategy remain unchanged.” Nevertheless, CoreWeave is still planning to spend lots of money in the coming months, acquisitions or not. On the conference call, Chief Financial Officer Nitin Agrawal said the company’s capital expenditures in fiscal 2026 will be “well in excess of double” its $12 billion to $14 billion forecast for the current year.

Title: After Multiple Delays, AST SpaceMobile's Prototype Satellite to Launch in December

After several months of delays, AST SpaceMobile looks ready to launch its first next-gen “BlueBird” satellite before the end of the year as it competes with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink effort. In an earnings report on Monday, AST SpaceMobile said the BlueBird 6 satellite, also known as FM1, is expected to launch in the first half of December. India’s space agency, ISRO, also told local media that the satellite is scheduled to fly in the second week of December. AST first aimed to launch its first batch of next-generation BlueBird satellites in Q1 2024. But it later said it planned on only launching one next-gen BlueBird, a prototype called the FM1, in Q2, before pushing that back three times, with some concern it might not occur until January. Monday's announcement pegs the launch to early next month. The company hasn’t explained the delay. But the second-generation BlueBird satellites are about three times larger than AST’s first-gen models, and will each span at over 2,000 square feet, making them exceptionally large and heavy. In addition, the US Federal Communications Commission only granted the company an experimental license to test the FM1 back in July, following objections from rival SpaceX. Despite the delays, AST is indicating it plans on launching another second-generation BlueBird, dubbed the FM2 soon, possibly in December. “BlueBird 7 (FM2) expected to ship to Cape Canaveral in November with orbital launch anticipated shortly thereafter,” the company said in the earnings report. Ironically, SpaceX has been contracted to launch FM2 using a Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites are crucial to AST’s business of supplying satellite connectivity to everyday phones, including powering messaging and video chats in cellular dead zones. AST has entered into partnerships with AT&T and Verizon to supply the satellite service to customers sometime next year. However, AST has repeatedly said it needs between 45 to 60 satellites in orbit to offer continuous service across the US. So, launching enough satellites on time is crucial to the company’s effort to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink, which is already available through T-Mobile and soon Boost Mobile. For now, AST is saying it’s “on track for five orbital launches expected by the end of Q1 2026, with launches every one to two months on average to reach [a] goal of 45 to 60 satellites by end of 2026.” In an earnings call, the company also said it was "fully funded" for a total of 100 plus satellites to improve the constellation's coverage and capabilities globally. In the call, AST executives also mentioned that a single SpaceX Falcon 9 has the capacity to carry around three next-generation BlueBird satellites. Meanwhile, Blue Origin's more powerful New Glenn should be able to carry an estimated 8. The company also agreed with an estimate that the AST constellation can kick off beta tests in North America once it has around 25 satellites in orbit. Editor's note: This story has been corrected to say the New Glenn vehicle should be able to carry an estimated 8, not 18 BlueBird satellites. My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.

Title: U.S. Treasury greenlights staking for crypto ETFs

Time Published: 2025-11-10T22:10:44Z
Full Content:
The U.S. Treasury has approved staking for crypto ETFs. The decision provides long-awaited clarity for asset managers, paving the way for yield-bearing ETFs by mid-2026. It officially allows U.S.-listed crypto ETFs to stake proof-of-stake assets like Ethereum and Solana and distribute staking rewards to investors. It levels the playing field between ETFs and direct crypto holders, enabling investors to earn passive yields within regulated products. The U.S. Treasury and IRS issued landmark guidance on 10 November, allowing crypto exchange-traded products [ETP] to stake digital assets and share rewards with retail investors. The safe harbor rules published in Revenue Procedure 2025-31 end months of regulatory uncertainty for major asset managers waiting to add yield-generating features to their Ethereum and Solana ETFs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the guidance would “increase investor benefits, boost innovation, and keep America the global leader in digital asset and blockchain technology.” Source: X Staking enables proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Solana, to validate network transactions. Validators earn rewards for securing the blockchain. Until today, U.S. crypto ETFs have been unable to participate in staking, despite direct crypto holders earning these yields. The new guidance changes that completely. ETFs can now stake their holdings through qualified custodians like Coinbase Custody, BitGo, or Gemini, who work with validator operators to earn rewards. The ETFs must distribute these rewards to investors at least quarterly. This gives regulated products a major advantage. Ethereum ETF holders can now earn staking yields through traditional brokerage accounts without managing validators or private keys themselves. Major issuers have been anticipating this moment since February. The SEC repeatedly delayed decisions, pushing deadlines from April to June, then to October. Asset managers waited anxiously while their non-staking ETFs underperformed direct Ethereum holdings by the foregone staking yield. Grayscale shareholders approved staking amendments in September, demonstrating investor demand for yield-bearing crypto products. BlackRock held closed-door meetings with the SEC earlier this year, adding to speculation that approval would eventually come. The safe harbor includes strict requirements. ETFs must trade on national securities exchanges, maintain 85% liquidity for redemptions, and stake only through unrelated third-party providers at arm’s length terms. The guidance protects trusts from slashing penalties where validators lose staked assets for misconduct. Existing ETFs have a nine-month window starting today to amend their trust agreements. This means Ethereum ETFs could begin staking by mid-2026. Solana ETFs is the latest, launched on 28 October. However, these funds launched without staking capabilities due to regulatory uncertainty. Today’s guidance provides the clear framework these issuers need. The Solana ETFs can now amend their trust agreements within the nine-month window to add staking, offering investors exposure to SOL’s higher yields of approximately 5-7% annually alongside the existing Ethereum funds. The guidance marks a significant shift in U.S. crypto regulation. Asset managers can finally compete with direct crypto ownership by offering institutional-grade staking through traditional investment vehicles.

Title: World’s largest asset managers’ AUM surges to record $140 trillion, driven by North America and passives

Time Published: 2025-11-10T21:59:00Z
Full Content:
November 10, 2025 16:59 ET | Source: Willis Towers Watson US LLC Willis Towers Watson US LLC NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Total assets under management (AUM) at the world’s 500 largest asset managers reached USD 139.9 trillion at the end of 2024, a 9.4% increase from the previous year, according to new research from leading global advisory, broking and solutions company, WTW’s (NASDAQ: WTW) Thinking Ahead Institute. This marks a continued recovery for the asset management industry with total assets now back above the record that was last set in 2021. This recovery was driven largely by managers in North America who registered the fastest growth, up 13% year-on-year and accounting for USD 88.2 trillion, or 63% of total AUM among the top 500 firms. Japan registered a decline from its asset managers, with AUM falling by 9.5% in 2024, highlighting regional disparities in economic and investment performance. On current growth rates, the UK, which was the second largest asset management market in 2019, now looks likely to fall to fourth position in the next five years, with France and Canada set to overtake it. Strategically, the industry is continuing to undergo a significant shift to passive investment strategies, which now account for 39.0% of total AUM, a 6.1% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, actively managed assets declined to 61%, down 3.6% year-on-year. The top 20 asset managers further consolidated their influence, now controlling 47% of total AUM, up from 45.5% in 2023. Their combined assets rose to USD 65.8 trillion, with 15 US-based firms representing 83.9% of this segment. Among these, BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity Investments retained their positions as the top three global managers, with BlackRock holding the top spot since 2009. This study also highlights the rapid rise of private-market specialists, whose AUM growth has outpaced traditional managers. For example, Brookfield’s AUM grew from USD 240 billion in 2017 to USD 1,061 billion in 2024 - an impressive 20% annualized increase over eight years and a rise of 46 places in the rankings, driven by investor demand for private credit, infrastructure, and real estate strategies. Across the regions, the Middle East has gained prominence as a strategic hub for asset managers, as regulatory reforms in the UAE, including updates to digital assets rules and the Qualifying Investment Funds regime, are attracting global firms to financial centres like the Dubai International Financial Centre and Abu Dhabi. Moreover, thematic opportunities in Shariah-compliant investing, ESG, and digital assets are aligning with national transformation agendas, making the region increasingly competitive. Elsewhere, Artificial Intelligence continues to become an enabler across the industry, with the study finding that 47% of firms are investing in AI for strategic, operational customer improvement purposes. However, adoption remains in its early stages, with 78% of firms allocating less than 10% of their tech budgets to AI. Despite this, the study did find 61% expect AI spending to grow over the next five years, whilst a similar number (64%) expressed concern about AI-related cyber risks. “This study paints a vivid picture of an industry in transition,” said Jessica Gao, Director of The Thinking Ahead Institute. We’re seeing a convergence of forces, from the rise of passive strategies and private markets to the growing influence of Artificial Intelligence. These trends are reshaping the very foundations of asset management. The scale of growth, particularly in North America, and the increasing concentration among the top 20 managers, signals both opportunity and responsibility. As stewards of nearly $140 trillion in assets, the industry must now balance performance with purpose, agility with accountability. This is a pivotal moment to redefine what long-term value means, not just for investors, but for society at large.” The world’s largest money managers Ranked by total AUM, in U.S. millions.

Easton, Maryland-based TeraWulf attributed the gain to Bitcoin's rising price, expanded mining capacity, and the start of high performance performance computing lease revenue. “The third quarter into the fourth has been remarkably busy for TeraWulf,” Paul Prager, TeraWulf chief executive officer, said in a statement, highlighting the a growing partnership with Fluidstack and Google. "These transactions demonstrate the strength of our platform and the trust that world-class technology partners place in our ability to execute." He added: “We are squarely focused on execution while advancing the next phase of growth for 2027 and beyond." Terawulf, which trades on the Nasdaq under the WULF ticker, was down 2.5% in after-hours trading Monday. WULF closed at $14.30, a 3.8% gain for the day. Over the past month, the company’s share price has climbed 7.6%. Preliminary guidance from Terawulf issued in late October said the company expected to report between $48 million and $52 million in revenue for Q3, representing an approximate 84% increase compared to the $27 million reported in the third quarter of 2024. TeraWulf went public through a merger with IKONICS in December 2021. At the time, it was more of a straightforward Bitcoin mining play. By late 2024, the company had started positioning itself to building "high-performance AI compute infrastructure." In August, Terawulf announced that it had struck a 10-year AI hosting deal with Fluidstack. The deal represents $3.7 billion in contract revenues, but could more than double to $8.7 billion through lease extensions. As part of the deal, Google signed on to backstop $1.8 billion worth of the AI firm’s lease obligations. In return, the Silicon Valley giant received 41 million shares worth of TeraWulf common stock, representing approximately an 8% pro forma equity ownership stake. "This is exactly the evolution we outlined: converting advantaged infrastructure positions into contracted megawatts with investment-grade counterparties and doing so at strategic scale," Prager said about the deal at the time. The deal gives Google a corporate stake that’s second only to Prager himself, who controls 10.7% of shares. The firm’s other institutional investors include Stammtisch Investments, Bayshore Capital, and Revolve Capital. Vanguard Group and BlackRock hold large positions too, but as passive index fund managers. The firms hold positions in nearly every U.S. publicly traded company.

Title: Paramount Posts Q3 Loss of $257 Million in First Earnings Post-Skydance Deal

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The media giant’s revenue was flat at $6.7 billion, weighed down by declines in TV advertising and distribution In its first quarter since the closing of Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition, Paramount swung to a loss of $257 million as revenue growth was flat at $6.7 billion. The results for its third quarter, which were weighed down by declines in linear TV advertising and distribution, included a $13 million loss under its new owner Skydance and $244 million under the media giant’s previous leadership. The company reported $2.58 billion in revenue for the quarter under previous leadership and $4.12 billion under new leadership. Despite missing Wall Street expectations, Paramount shares jumped 6% in after-hours trading on Monday as the David Ellison-led media giant raised its cost savings target to $3 billion and outlined its vision for the future. “While we’re still in the early stages, this is only day 96,” Paramount CEO David Ellison told analysts during the company’s earnings call. “We’re energized by the progress we’ve made and the clear path ahead.” Here are the results: Net loss: A loss of $257 million, compared to a profit of $1 million in the year-ago period. Earnings per share: Loss of 37 cent per share, with an adjusted loss of 12 cents a share, compared to earnings of 38 cents per share expected by analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance. Revenue: $6.7 billion, compared to $6.99 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance. Streaming subscribers: Added 1.4 million subscribers for a total of 79.1 million globally. Starting in the fourth quarter, Paramount will no longer include free trialers in its total subscriber count. As of the end of the third quarter, free trialers totaled 1.2 million. Revenue in its streaming business grew 17% year-over-year to $2.17 billion, driven by a 24% increase in Paramount+ revenue to $1.77 billion. Paramount’s streaming business posted a profit of $340 million, including $105 million pre-merger and $235 million post-merger, compared to $49 million a year ago. But the TV Media segment was a drag on the overall results, with revenue falling 12% to $3.8 billion, driven by a 12% decline in advertising on lower political spending and underreported revenue from an international sales partner in 2024; a 7% decline in affiliate revenue due to cord-cutting; and a 22% decline in licensing and other revenue due to the timing of content delivery. The segment posted a profit of $822 million, down from a profit of $936 million a year ago. Filmed Entertainment revenue grew 30% to $756 million, primarily due to the consolidation of Skydance licensing and other revenue. However, the segment swung to a loss of $49 million due to lower than expected performance of its film slate during the quarter, with disappointments like “Smurfs” and “The Naked Gun.” The latest quarterly results come as the company has submitted three separate bids to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery, which ranged between $19 and $23.50 per share and were rejected for being too low. It also comes on the heels of Paramount’s $150 million purchase of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. Paramount has raised its cost savings target to $3 billion, up from $2 billion previously. That plan has included roughly 1,000 layoffs thus far, with additional cuts to come at a later date. In addition to the formal layoffs, Paramount will begin a phased return to office in January. Approximately 600 employees chose voluntary severance packages in its first phase. More than $1.4 billion in savings will have been generated between the merger closing in August and the end of 2025, with an additional $1 billion plus in cost savings planned for 2026. It expects to complete those cuts by the end of 2027, generating approximately $800 million in 2026 and between $400 million and $500 million in 2027. In addition to labor, the media giant is also looking at areas such as real estate, procurement and workflow to find efficiencies. As part of a “comprehensive strategic review” of its assets, Paramount recently divested the Argentinian free-to-air network Telefe and is in the process of divesting Chilevision in Chile, which the company expects to complete in the first quarter of 2026. These divestitures will reduce the company’s workforce by approximately 1,600 additional employees. At the same time, Paramount plans to invest in excess of $1.5 billion in programming in 2026, including streaming investment in the UFC, Paramount+ originals, third-party catalog licensing and ramping up its film slate, with plans to target at least 15 movies per year over the next few years. The company has set new deals with the UFC, Professional Bull Riders and Zuffa Boxing, greenlit new series such as Jeremy Strong’s “9/12” and Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning’s “Discretion,” and forged partnerships with“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, The Duffer Brothers, Will Smith and James Mangold. Though Taylor Sheridan is set to exit the company after his contract expires in 2028, he has also been tapped to work on a film adaptation of video game franchise “Call of Duty” with Peter Berg. Paramount also plans to raise prices for Paramount+ in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026. Leadership has said they would look to transform Paramount into a technological leader in entertainment, with plans to use tools like virtual production and AI, which would increase efficiencies, help with search, discovery and recommendations and boost content creation. “We really view AI as a tool for artists to be able to iterate more quickly, to be able to tell better stories and basically create even further accessibility, really, across the entire content creation pipeline,” Ellison said. “So from that standpoint, we think technology is going to impact all aspects of our business and we want to be a leader in that space.” Paramount will also leverage Skydance’s existing relationship with David’s father Larry Ellison’s Oracle, which the company has paid $2 million for software support agreements and database licenses since the merger closed. Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ will move to a unified backend infrastructure by mid-2026 and the media giant will use a single enterprise resource planning (ERP) system by early 2027, which David Ellison said would lead to “significant operational efficiency” across the company and “give better real-time information to managers.” “The better visibility you have in terms of how the company is doing on a day-to-day basis, that improves your decision making. So we’re in the process of deploying that,” he added. Ellison has argued the Paramount would be the “best partner” for WBD, adding that other potential acquirers would need to overcome “significant (perhaps insurmountable) hurdles given their dominant market positions.” In an Oct. 13 letter to WBD’s board, Paramount argued that the value to shareholders in a break-up would be less than $15 per share or roughly $18 to $20 per share including a “robust, yet highly uncertain, M&A premium for Warner Bros,” an individual familiar with the matter confirmed to TheWrap. In order to sweeten the bid, Ellison even offered Warner CEO David Zaslav a co-CEO and co-chairman title, as well as increasing the portion of the bid paid in cash to shareholders from 60% to 80% and increasing the breakup fee from $2 billion to $2.1 billion. CNBC reported that Paramount is also considering taking a tender offer directly to WBD shareholders and formalizing a hostile bid for the company. If successful in acquiring WBD, TheWrap previously reported that Ellison would look to merge HBO Max and Paramount+ into a “super platform” under one scenario being considered. The theatrical model is also at the core of his vision and a combined company would look to target an output of 30 films per year as part of its commitment to that model. “It’s important to know that there’s no must-haves for us — we really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go,” Ellison said on Monday’s earnings call when asked about WBD and the company’s M&A strategy. “We believe we can achieve our goals with our creative content engines, we believe we can achieve our streaming goals and that we can drive enterprise efficiency and create value and long term free cash flow generation all through the building standpoint.” Ellison said Paramount would make M&A decisions that tie back into its core principles. “We’re fortunate that we have the balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic when we think that M&A will accelerate our goals, but we’re also long term disciplined owner operators,” Ellison said. “So from that standpoint, we’ll always approach things through the lens of how do we maximize value for shareholders.” Paramount president Jeff Shell also reiterated that the company would hang onto its cable networks. “This company has a history of spinning assets and it hasn’t gone very well for us and we think for others,” Shell explained. “One of the big rationales for a spin is that when companies are standalone, they can focus on driving the value of the brands that they have in a more specific way. We are going to do that, but we’re going to do that within our company so our shareholders get the value of that.” He also noted that the declines in broadcast are “very modest” compared to cable and that its content is “increasingly a huge driver” for streaming subscriber growth and engagement. Shell said the company plans to increase its investments in CBS and look at its brands such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET to see if it can “transform those businesses in a digital way to drive value long term and make them increasing pieces of our overall scale and global streaming strategy.” Looking ahead, Paramount expects $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion in revenue, or growth of 1% to 4% year over year, for the fourth quarter, driven by strength in streaming offset by declines in the TV Media and Filmed Entertainment segments. It also expects $500 million to $600 million in adjusted operating income. Additionally, the company anticipates a restructuring charge of $500 million in the fourth quarter related to its “realignment and transformation.” Paramount+ net adds are expected to come in lower than the third quarter due to the termination of two international hard bundles. On a full year basis, it expects streaming to be profitable in 2025, but losses in the fourth quarter due to “seasonally-weighted content costs.” Theatrical revenue is also expected to be down as it reworks its film slate and is impacted by the comparison to “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.” Starting in the first quarter of 2026, Paramount will change its reporting structure to reflect its reorganization. The move will house all production and IP in one place with Studios, including almost all licensing revenue, while the remaining TV Media segment will be comprised of its broadcasting and cable businesses. For 2026, it is forecasting $30 billion in revenue, a 4% increase from the midpoint of its 2025 forecast, driven by streaming revenue growth due to price increases and the termination of additional international hard bundles, and adjusted operating income of $3.5 billion, driven by progress in cost-cutting and investments in content and technology. The company expects a “more moderate” decline in linear advertising versus 2025 due to political spending in 2026, new ad agency partnerships, the sale of Telefe and the planned sale of Chilevision. It also expects to grow streaming profitability in 2026, driven by the UFC, South Park and “several hundred million” dollars of investment in film and series for Paramount+, and return to profitability in its Filmed Entertainment segment on a full-year basis in 2026. Paramount expects to return to investment grade debt metrics by the end of 2027. The company ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $13.6 billion in gross debt. It also has $433 million in debt maturing over the next 12 months.

Title: XRP Flashes Strongest Macro Bull Trend in Its History: Chartist

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP is printing its most constructive long-term structure on record, according to independent chartist “The Great Mattsby” (@matthughes13), who points to the three-month Ichimoku system and a year-long base forming above its key quarterly averages. On the latest 3-month XRP/USD chart from Bitstamp, the in-progress candle shows price around $2.31, with the Ichimoku conversion line and baseline tracking just beneath spot. The analyst highlights that XRP “has never built a base above the 3 month conversion or baseline in its history and it’s doing it now for the past year” (posted Nov. 8, 2025). That observation is notable because, in prior cycles, quarterly closes consistently failed to hold above those Ichimoku reference lines after rallies, whereas the current cycle has seen price stabilize on top of them for multiple quarters in a row. The present quarterly candle remains open, but the configuration—price above both the 3-month conversion and baseline—visually underscores the claim of an ongoing macro bull trend. And there’s a more bullish structure for XRP. XRP has been oscillating between the 0.886 Fibonacci retracement at $2.25877 and its 2018 cycle all-time high at $3.31700. Since early December last year, price repeatedly defended the $2.25877 band as support while failing to secure acceptance above the $3.31700 ceiling on the weekly chart, creating a horizontal range capped by the former peak. “To put things in perspective, XRP has been consolidating between the 0.886 Fibonacci level and its 2018 all-time high (2.25877–3.317). It’s building a strong base above the 0.886 Fib,” Mattsby wrote on Oct. 12, adding that this structure keeps XRP in what he calls a “#Palantiring candidate” posture. Although that remark is four weeks old, the argument remains intact on the posted chart: the 0.886 area continues to function as the pivotal shelf. Beyond the prior-cycle high, the same weekly framework maps out upside extension levels that would logically come into play only if $3.31700 is reclaimed and held. Those include the 1.272 extension around $8.29661, the 1.414 near $13.38940, and the 1.618 up at $26.63038. Closer to price, the stacked retracement supports below $2.25877 are clearly demarcated at $1.61246 (0.786), $1.12487 (0.702), $0.91531 (0.618), $0.61495 (0.500), $0.41315 (0.382), and $0.25257 (0.236), delineating the ladder of demand zones that governed XRP’s multi-year range prior to the latest advance. Taken together, the two timeframes tell a coherent story. On the high-timeframe Ichimoku view, XRP is maintaining altitude above its 3-month conversion and baseline for the first sustained period in its history—an objective sign of trend strength. On the weekly, price action has compressed into a well-defined band between $2.26 and $3.32, with repeated mean-reversions indicating accumulation rather than distribution while the market tests overhead supply at the 2018 high. As long as the 0.886 retracement at $2.25877 continues to hold on closing bases, the consolidation thesis laid out by The Great Mattsby—and the characterization of this as XRP’s strongest macro bull trend to date on Ichimoku terms—remains technically valid. At press time, XRP traded at $2.56. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Pachama laid off around 20 employees this summer as voluntary carbon markets softened. The company had attracted investments from a range of prominent names, including Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and several celebrity angel investors, including Ellen DeGeneres, Laura Dern, and Serena Williams. “The current uncertain and volatile financial, economic, and geopolitical climate, added to the anti-ESG agenda in the U.S., is indeed having an effect on corporate sustainability budgets,” Diego Saez Gil, CEO of Pachama, told Trellis when the layoffs happened. “The impact is especially acute in the voluntary carbon market, which was already in a moment of correction.” Pachama had raised $88 million, while Carbon Direct had raised $60.8 million, according to PitchBook. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Pachama was focused on nature-based carbon credits, which typically result when forests are either restored or preserved. Carbon Direct, on the other hand, is more of a carbon market advisory and accounting firm, helping companies track and report their carbon footprints and then vet carbon credits to offset them. The carbon markets have been roiled by uncertainty in the last few years, and not all of it has been the result of political whiplash in the U.S. and elsewhere. Voluntary carbon markets have come under fire for falling short of their promises. For example, a major investigation by The Guardian found that more than 90% of one verifier’s credits did not actually result in any carbon reductions. One of the biggest challenges facing nature-based carbon credits is the question of whether forests protected by the purchases were threatened with destruction in the first place. And while large companies have been dialing back their publicity around ESG measures, many are still interested in sticking to their net-zero promises. Carbon Direct customers include Microsoft, Shopify, American Express, JP Morgan, Alaska Airlines, and BlackRock.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect CoreWeave Stock To Move After Earnings on Monday

CoreWeave (CRWV) is slated to report third-quarter results after the closing bell on Monday, with traders expecting a big post-earnings move for the stock. Options pricing suggests traders anticipate shares of CoreWeave could move up to 14% in either direction by the end of this week. A move of that size would push the stock up to $118.70 at the high end, erasing some of the losses incurred amid last week’s slump in tech stocks, or drag it down to $89.30, its lowest price since early September. CoreWeave has only reported quarterly results twice since it began trading, and neither has helped the stock. In May, shares fell more than 2% the day after the company's earnings were released, despite better-than-expected results, with revenue increasing more than 400% year-over-year. Shares tumbled more than 20% after earnings in August, when the company reported a wider-than-expected loss. CoreWeave shares have soared since debuting in March, with investors looking past the company's unprofitability to focus on surging revenue driven by AI demand. How investors react to the company's results on Monday could reflect Wall Street's risk appetite and sentiment pertaining to the AI stock rally. Granted, CoreWeave's shares advanced considerably leading up to both prints. The stock gained nearly 70% between its late-March IPO and May’s report, and rose about 120% heading into August’s results. This time could be different. Leading into Monday's session, CoreWeave shares were down about 30% since its last earnings. CoreWeave's revenue has soared in the last year and a half amid a surge in demand for AI-enabling cloud computing platforms. The company landed several major customers last quarter, signing a $14 billion deal with Meta Platforms (META), a $6 billion deal with Nvidia (NVDA), and a $6.5 billion expansion of its existing agreement with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The cloud computing provider is expected to report a third-quarter net loss of $284.4 million, narrowing from a loss of $359.8 million in the year ago quarter. Its revenue is projected to jump 120% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Wall Street is split on the outlook for CoreWeave’s stock, with five of the 10 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha calling the stock a “buy,” and the other half assigning it a “hold” rating. Their mean target of $158.83 represents about 53% upside from the stock’s closing price last Friday.

Time Published: 2025-11-10T16:29:06Z
Full Content:
Nick Lichtenberg is business editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. A leading investment bank has delivered an arresting diagnosis of the U.S. economy: the labor market, long a pillar of resilience, may be in real trouble. In their latest economic outlook, UBS economists led by Jonathan Pingle painted a picture of mounting weakness that extends well beyond headline job numbers, warning of a growing risk to households and the broader recovery. The latest “US Economics Weekly” note from the Swiss investment bank came with bated breath ahead of the impending end of the federal government shutdown. Economists and market-watchers have been deprived of federal economic data for over 40 days, something that former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erica Groshen likened to “flying blind” in late October. If the government does reopen, Pingle’s team said it expects jobs data for September to be released next week, and potentially the October inflation report, the Consumer Price Index. Economists need that data now more than ever. For much of the year, top economists, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have said we’re in a “low hire, low fire” jobs market. For much of the year, employers were laconic in hiring, and seemed afraid to fire their workers; perhaps still wounded from the pandemic-era “Great Resignation.” UBS isn’t alone on Wall Street in worrying that, maybe the “low-fire” part of the equation isn’t quite true anymore. Now, “there are plenty of available workers that, on the whole, businesses probably don’t feel the need to hold on to workers for longer than necessary,” Veronica Clark, a Citigroup Inc. economist, told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas, also told Bloomberg that “you’ve got a substantial number of well-established companies making pretty big head cuts.” Firing is running higher than advertised, UBS argued, citing the fact that “unemployment insurance claims, layoff announcements and WARN notices have all been running ahead of the pre-pandemic pace. Even the lagged Business Employment Dynamics data, the gold standard of data on job creation and job destruction dynamics has been showing the pace of job loss at or above the pre-pandemic pace through the latest data.” Indeed, cuts have accelerated sharply. October saw 157,000 layoffs announced by corporations, per industry standard Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the highest monthly total since July 2020. Technology and warehousing were hit especially hard, with cuts also linked to automation and artificial intelligence.​ The year-to-date tally? A startling 760,000 seasonally adjusted cuts through October, far outpacing the same period in 2024 and running higher than any year since 2009 — the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis. Major companies are taking action: Amazon cut 14,000 corporate roles, UPS has slashed 48,000 jobs over the past year, and Target eliminated nearly 2,000 staff in a single sweep.​ Workers are getting thrown into a growing pool of others not finding jobs. UBS likens the job market to a bathtub: with outflows (layoffs) steady and inflows (hiring) slowing, the water level (total jobs) is bound to fall. The hiring rate, as measured by multiple business surveys, has dropped to levels historically seen only in recessions. Excluding healthcare and social assistance, which have been relatively steady, private-sector payrolls have been declining by an average of 36,000 jobs per month. Since the start of the year, household employment as measured by the main government survey has been falling by about 72,000 jobs per month through August. Such a pace is “well below” the rate required to keep up with population growth, let alone maintain a stable unemployment rate, which has now crept up to a post-2021 high. Labor force participation has slipped, and more than 800,000 people have left the labor force but say they still want a job.​ Economists note the broadest measure of underemployment, known as U-6, has jumped by 0.6 percentage points since January to 8.1%. That’s now 1.3 percentage points higher than at the end of 2019. Notably, the rise isn’t just about people out of work: more Americans are working part-time for economic reasons, another classic sign of slackening demand. “That is exactly the opposite of what should happen under a negative labor supply shock stemming from immigration,” UBS wrote, referring to the Trump administration’s argument that immigration restrictions would tighten the labor market. Job openings continue to decline: as of the end of October, Indeed.com reported that postings had sunk to their lowest level since 2021, with almost every sector seeing year-over-year drops. Meanwhile, the weekly average of initial unemployment claims is running above 2023’s level and continuing claims are nearing a post-pandemic high.​ And even the openings that appear active, Pingle argued, may not be tied to real hiring efforts. The hiring rate “consistent with recession” has been a gap “so large that seemingly many of the openings probably are not seeing much effort to be filled,” according to Pingle. “We can also look at the 14 million people not working but who want a job or are searching for one, or the 2 million collecting unemployment benefits. Given that abundance, it would seem that at least some of the openings do not appear anxious to be filled.” Not only are workers losing jobs, but the market for new opportunities is shrinking as well. Seasonal hiring plans for the holidays are running well below pre-pandemic norms. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reports a combined September/October total of just 400,000 announced holiday roles — sharply lower than the 625,000 average for the 2014–19 period and even below recent years. Key retailers like Target aren’t even disclosing numbers, and the National Retail Federation suggests seasonal jobs could be down 40% from a year ago.​ This chill is hitting consumer and business sentiment. The University of Michigan’s consumer confidence reading dropped to 50.3 in November, barely above the all-time low set in 2022. Fewer households report jobs are plentiful, and the share expecting unemployment to rise over the next year has soared to levels not seen since the recession-scarred 1980s. Among small businesses, optimism is “struggling to gain traction” amid inflation fears and continued labor market turmoil.​ Federal Reserve officials are increasingly divided, with some policymakers warning that the risk to jobs now rivals concerns about inflation. While some see an argument for interest rate cuts to buffer the labor market, others worry inflation isn’t yet tamed. One Fed governor admitted she worries because “the labor market can deteriorate very quickly,” calling for caution and flexibility as each new set of economic data is released.​ The investment bank’s conclusion? If layoffs keep pace and hiring continues to slow, the labor market is headed for “more obvious contraction.” And that, they warn, could soon filter down to undermine household confidence, consumer spending — and the entire recovery. “If a bathtub is draining faster and faster while the faucet isn’t changed, eventually the water level is going to start to drop. That is a material risk to the outlook.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: McCarthy confident golden U20 generation will thrive

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Since the last Rugby World Cup, the age profile of this Ireland squad has come in for scrutiny. Even with the recent retirements of Conor Murray, Peter O'Mahony and Cian Healy, Andy Farrell’s side are leaning on an experienced core, which he appears to be banking on to get them to the next tournament in Australia in 2027. By the time that rolls around, many of tried-and-trusted frontliners in this Irish team will be well into their 30s. Bundee Aki will be 37 by the next World Cup, while Tadhg Beirne, Jack Conan, Jamison Gibson-Park, James Lowe and Stuart McCloskey will be 35. Tadhg Furlong, Josh van der Flier and Robbie Henshaw will all be 34. Some of those players may not make the next World Cup, while others might even last beyond it, but the reality is that within the next four years, each season will likely see a couple of hundred international appearances leave this Irish squad, one retirement after another. Farrell may be leaning on those players now, but the head coach knows he has to prepare for a changing of the guard, and the amount of Emerging Ireland, Ireland A and Ireland XV games that have been popping up in recent seasons illustrates that. Time will tell if that transition is a success or not, but for now, Farrell is content to slowly drip-feed experience to the next generation. It’s just over two years since arguably Ireland's best ever Under-20s side reached the World Cup final in Cape Town, capping off a remarkable 18 months under former head coach Richie Murphy, which saw back-to-back Six Nations Grand Slams, and just a second ever run to the world final. Of that 2023 World Cup side, three were involved for the Ireland senior team in Saturday's 41-10 win against Japan, with hooker Gus McCarthy (above), prop Paddy McCarthy and out-half Sam Prendergast all featuring off the bench. "It's really, really positive, and it brings such joy seeing lads you've played with come up around you," Gus McCarthy says. "I'm sure there'll be more in the years to come, plenty of lads in our age group, a lot of the lads playing later on today [for Ireland XV against Spain] and even some lads that aren't, that are really, really good players that I'd say we'll see, hopefully soon." Others from that group have had a taste of international rugby; from the 2022 Grand Slam winners, Jack Boyle has established himself as an international in the last 12 months, while tighthead Scott Wilson had a summer call-up. A star of the 2023 side, Hugh Gavin, was capped on the summer tour in Portugal, while Diarmuid Mangan, James McNabney, Fintan Gunne and Hugh Cooney have all been involved in extended Ireland squads. Brian Gleeson had been due to be with the squad in Chicago a fortnight ago, only for injury to rule him out. Leinster hooker Gus McCarthy – captain of the 2023 U20s - found his way into the Ireland squad through a series of injuries this time 12 months ago, and grabbed the opportunity with both hands. On Saturday he came off the bench to score his third Irish try on his eight appearance, although he isn't taking too much credit for the score. Gus McCarthy with Ireland's latest try as the home side move 17 points clear. 📺 RTÉ2 🖥️ https://t.co/b2OI4OoWVJ ✍️ https://t.co/x26q4bjNM0 pic.twitter.com/4cga8K3e6R "The lads that were on the pitch for the first 60, 50 minutes, putting in all the groundwork, they tired them down. "I was delighted to get a try. I can't say I did anything, it was the back of the maul. "I was obviously a bit nervous coming on, still very inexperienced, so just wanted to get into the game, you just want to get your first impact, kind of get you into the game. "It was in the balance, so I was very nervous but I wanted to just come on and try and make as much of an impact as I could and just play my own game. "I still feel like I'm still relatively inexperienced and kind of want to prove myself, but the lads are so accommodating to new lads coming into the group. "We saw there today with Tom Farrell, new lads coming into the camp fit in so seamlessly because the squad of lads we have are such an excellent squad. "All the leaders and all the older lads are so accommodating and kind of make you feel welcome and help you as much as they can when you come into the squad." His fellow McCarthy – Paddy – also got on the scoresheet, his first for Ireland in his second appearance, having made his debut against New Zealand last week. And having packed down alongside Paddy for several years dating back to their school days at Blackrock College, Gus isn't one bit surprised about how well his team-mate has settled into the Ireland squad. "You see, he's such an explosive talent, he's a big, big man, like his brother [Joe], I don't know what they have in them. "They just have some crazy strength in them and he's a very, very exciting player. I've played with him since we were about 11 so I know exactly what he can do. "It's really, really special to be out there together. We've played as a front row together for a very, very long time, so it's great just having him there now, I can trust him. "You can't just have players who play on paper. The two of them bring incredible amounts of individuality, and you need that in rugby. "As you saw today, he just picked up, went himself and scored. You need lads like that, so it's really, really good to have," Gus added. Watch Ireland v Australia in the Quilter Nations Series on Saturday from 7pm on RTÉ2 and the RTÉ Player.

Share this article BlackRock, a major asset manager actively managing institutional cryptocurrency holdings through spot Bitcoin ETFs, deposited 1,271 Bitcoin worth nearly $135 million into Coinbase today. The transfer to Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform facilitating large-scale institutional deposits, comes amid broader market uncertainty. BlackRock has been executing repeated transfers of Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime as part of deliberate portfolio management strategies. These deposits came amid growing optimism following reports of a possible end to the 40-day US government shutdown. On Sunday, the Senate approved a bipartisan funding deal that could allow federal agencies to fully reopen as soon as the measure is passed by the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Donald Trump.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin and Ethereum funds accounted for $876 million worth of withdrawals last week, more than any other issuer. The Fidelity Wise Original Bitcoin Fund accounted for another $438 million worth of outflows. The outflow from BTC and ETH funds was due to "negative sentiment that pervaded the markets due to ongoing gyrations in the crypto markets" thanks to the Oct. 10 flash crash and growing uncertainty about a December rate cut from the Federal Open Markets Committee. As of Monday morning, futures trading suggests there's a 64.6% chance that the FOMC will lower rates by 25 basis points during its December meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. A month ago, traders thought there was a 91.7% chance that there would be another cut. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned last month that a further rate cut in December is not a foregone decision and acknowledged voices calling for the Fed to “at least wait a cycle” before reducing rates further. That's a bearish signal for crypto traders because, historically, Federal Reserve rate cuts boost the flow of capital into riskier assets like equities and digital assets. The CoinShares report also noted there is still a stark difference in activity for ETP shares on U.S. and European exchanges. U.S. exchanges had $1.2 billion worth of selling, accounting for the bulk of negative sentiment. But Germany and Switzerland inflows totaled $41.3 million and $49.7 million, respectively. "EPT trading volumes remained elevated at $43 billion for the week as flows on an intraday basis briefly recovered on Thursday as optimism grew that progress was being made towards resolving the U.S. government shutdown, but this prove short-lived, with renewed outflows emerging on Friday as those hopes faded," wrote CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill. Meanwhile, flow to Solana and other altcoin funds have been consistently trending positively. "Altcoins remained buoyant, with Solana seeing $118 million last week and $2.1 billion over the last 9 weeks," Butterfill said. "Other notable inflows were seen in HBAR ($26.8 million) and Hyperliquid ($4.2 million)." The Bitwise Solana ETF has had steady demand since it debuted Oct. 28. Canary Capital introduced its HBAR ETF, which trades on the Nasdaq under the HBR ticker, on Oct. 27 and has already attracted nearly $69 million worth of assets. And although there's currently no spot ETF that offers exposure to HYPE, the native token for the Hyperliquid Layer 1 blockchain, there is a 21Shares exchange-traded product trading on the SIX Swiss Exchange since August.

Title: We Compared Steak Prices Across 9 Grocery Stores – Here's Where You Can Find The Cheapest Cuts
URL: https://www.tastingtable.com/2017101/steak-grocery-store-prices-cheapest-cuts/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T14:20:00Z
Full Content:
Steak is sometimes thought of as a special treat, a fancy dinner, or simply out of reach. Since the price of steak has risen more than 40% since 2020, according to Visual Capitalist, that may seem like a safe assessment. But one reason prices are so high is simple supply and demand — people still want steak for dinner, special treat or not. But even though beef is increasingly in demand, U.S. cattle herds have diminished in size and drought has hurt supply — thus driving higher prices. The gold standard is to support your local farm or rancher. Buying from the source means reinvesting in growing herds, boosting supply, and ultimately, driving down costs. That said, if you're unable to source from your local farmer, there are a multitude of options at the grocery store. You can still snag quality steaks if you know where to look. The national average for steak in U.S. grocery stores is $12.26 per pound, but of course, this averages higher-end cuts like ribeye and strip with lower-end cuts like chuck and round and doesn't account for regional differences. So we did a deep dive and checked out prices across several popular grocery stores to find the cheapest cuts of steak. We looked at price per pound across each store's regional locations, factored each store's national average, and then compared them to see where you can get the cheapest cuts. Prices are as of the date of publication and may vary based on region. Aldi began as the world's first discount store and still remains one of the best places to find affordable items. So perhaps it's no surprise that Aldi comes in as the store with the cheapest cuts of steak when strictly comparing prices, though its prices are a little higher than the national average for U.S. supermarkets. The biggest drawback is that Aldi doesn't offer many steak cuts, so your options are fairly limited. But you'll find basic cuts like ribeye, strip, sirloin, round, and skirt, and if you think the lower prices are indicative of lower quality meat, you would be mistaken. We think these are some of the best steak cuts you can buy at Aldi. Take, for instance, the almighty ribeye, one of the most coveted pieces of meat. A little higher than the overall supermarket national average for ribeye (about $10), you can score this most scrumptious cut for about $13 per pound, which is the cheapest ribeye on our list. Likewise, Aldi offers the cheapest New York strip (but on par with Trader Joe's) for $14.44. However, if you're looking for cheaper cuts than those, Aldi also offers top round and eye of round for about $8, and we think that's a valuable find. Similar to Aldi, Trader Joe's revolutionized discount food shopping by offering customers lower prices on specialty brands and private-label products. Its unique offerings could be one of the reasons you tend to buy more than what's on your shopping list when you visit a Trader Joe's. It may not be as cheap as Aldi, but you can certainly find affordable items, including cuts of steak. But like Aldi, your steak options are somewhat limited. You'll pay more for ribeye at Trader Joe's — the national average for the chain is $15.49 per pound. This is a few dollars more than Aldi and about $5 over the national supermarket average. New York strip is about the same price as Aldi, between $14 and $15, but sirloin comes in about a dollar cheaper than Aldi, making it your best option for this cut. If you're looking for a fancier cut of steak, maybe for a truly special dinner, then you're in luck. Trader Joe's features some of the most affordable filet mignon at $21.99, which is pretty close to the national average for all supermarkets. Walmart is well-known for its giant Supercenters, which feature endless aisles of food and drink, plus sprawling produce and deli sections. The iconic store is also known for its low prices and wide range of products, including name brands and private labels. If we were choosing an overall best option for variety and reasonable prices, Walmart would come out on top. It's easy to find a cut that you can both afford and enjoy. But comparing price to price, you'll pay more for ribeye, strip, and sirloin than you would at Aldi or Trader Joe's. However, in relation to the other stores on our list, you'll get the best deal on skirt steak at just over $10 per pound, porterhouse for $13.47, and flank for about $12 — all of which are a couple of dollars over the national supermarket average. Walmart is one of the few stores on our list to offer the most steak choices — from upscale cuts like ribeye, strip, and porterhouse to tougher cuts like chuck and various cuts of round. You can even source Wagyu ribeye and strip at Walmart for just under $28 per pound. Costco has come under fire from customers for rising beef prices, though, as stated previously, prices have risen just about everywhere. But when you pay for a store membership in order to, hopefully, cut bottom-line costs, it's disappointing when prices are actually higher than at stores that don't require a membership. The membership fee itself only equates to between $5 to $10 per month (before tax), but what's the point if it doesn't save you money in the long run? You just might be better off shopping for steak elsewhere. But Costco sells in bulk, and that's an obvious benefit over smaller, non-wholesale grocery stores. Even though prices are increasing at Costco, you'll find some of the cheapest ribeye (after Aldi), as well as some of the most affordable top round, tri-tip, and flank steak. So if you have a Costco membership, no worries; there are still plenty of options to choose from while sticking to a tight budget. And if you feel like splurging on a special cut of beef, consider the filet mignon, which is the cheapest on our list at $19.99 — on par with the national supermarket average. Bonus: Get Costco ground beef in bulk during the holiday season if you're after high-quality beef. Sam's Club is another wholesale, membership-based grocer with fees ranging from a couple of bucks to $10 per month, depending on the level you choose. It's also one of the best supermarkets to find certain cuts of steak at incredibly affordable prices. Though you'll pay more at Sam's Club for cuts like ribeye and strip than you would at Walmart and Costco (about $3 to $6 per pound more for ribeye and $1 more for strip), you'll pay less for chuck and round. Sam's Club also offers skirt, flank, and tri-tip at excellent prices: about $11, $11.50, and $10.50 per pound, respectively. Though you may not be as familiar with these cuts as ribeye, strip, or chuck, this could be a good time to practice your cooking skills. Buying in bulk at low cost is a less risky way to learn how to make a restaurant-worthy tri-tip steak or master the best way to serve up skirt steak. And don't forget to impress your friends and family with a grilled balsamic flank steak at your next gathering. Cheap steak doesn't have to mean bland steak. Publix is a well-loved Southern supermarket chain that has earned its reputation as a shopper's delight with its commitment to fresh food, in-house butchery, and BOGO deals that turn higher prices into instant bargains. Of course, it's also loved for specialty items like its Supreme Cakes and fried chicken. When it comes to steak cuts, Publix lands somewhere in the middle with its prices and options. After Aldi and Trader Joe's, Publix offers some of the cheapest New York strip at about $17 per pound, which is on par with Costco and Walmart. But unlike Aldi and Trader Joe's, Publix has a wider range of cuts to choose from. You'll find cuts like porterhouse and T-bones for around $17, sirloin, flat iron, and tri-tip for between $14 and $15, and chuck and round for roughly between $12 and $13. However, Publix is known for its sales, especially around the holidays, when standing rib roasts are marked down to $6.99 per pound. But instead of roasting the entire piece of meat, you can slice it into individual cuts of steak, and voilà, you've got yourself some seriously cheap ribeye. Albertsons was founded in 1939 as a one-stop market that focused on offering quality items at competitive prices. Today, it has continued that legacy by stocking a wide array of steak cuts, from premium ribeye and strip to the more affordable chuck and round. Albertsons caters to budget-conscious shoppers by offering frequent promotions. While it may not undercut deep-discount rivals like Walmart or Costco with its everyday pricing, the chain holds its own with mid-price steak cuts. The fact that it offers such a wide range makes it a great choice for those looking for variety. Comparatively speaking, Albertsons has some of the cheapest porterhouse and T-bone steaks for between $12 and $14, more affordable than Kroger, Publix, or Whole Foods. It also offers up some of the cheapest flat iron and tri-tip at about $11 per pound, giving you more ways to expand your meaty expertise. These under-the-radar cuts open up opportunities to create dishes like herby grilled flat iron steak and smoky tri-tip tacos, keeping both your stomach and wallet happy. Kroger got its start as the pioneer of in-house grocery store bakeries in 1883, and eventually expanded to thousands of locations. It has a long history of competing with the biggest supermarkets in the U.S. and still offers low prices on everyday selections. However, it's not one of the cheapest stores on our list when it comes to steak. Kroger may not shine when it comes to inexpensive, higher-quality cuts. Ribeye, strip, filet mignon, and sirloin are priced pretty high, with ribeye and strip costing an average of more than $20 per pound — but it does stock a handful of other cuts that are much more reasonably priced. So though you may not be rushing to grab the ribeye, Kroger features top and bottom round and eye of round, with price ranging from $9 to $12. Kroger stocks flat iron, skirt, flank, and tri-tip for under $15, which is comparable to Sam's Club, Costco, and Albertsons. Whole Foods isn't really a supermarket that comes to mind when you're talking about cheap cuts of steak, but it lands on our list for offering customers some of the cheapest cuts of round. For under $10 per pound, you can get eye of round steaks or the entire round. Top round is about $12 while tri-tip and sirloin hover around $15 or $16. Like most grocery stores, ribeye and strip are on the higher end at over $20 per pound. Whole Foods is mostly known for its sky-high standards for sourcing. That makes it tough to compare its flat iron steak to the run-of-the-mill version found at discount stores like Walmart or Costco. That said, the chain occasionally drops deals on premium cuts, matching the lower prices seen at the other stores on our list. Amazon Prime members receive discounts on selected items, but these may vary. To research steak prices for some of the most popular grocery stores in the U.S., we assessed the prices of 17 different cuts of steak across nine stores. We gathered prices for each cut at each store using multiple locations. To determine each store's national average, we compiled data from every region (if the store was located there). It was interesting to note that each store was pretty consistent with its pricing of steak across its locations. That's to say that the ribeye at Aldi generally costs the same at its locations in Florida and Oregon. We pulled the prices for the national average price per pound for retail steak across all supermarkets using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 2024 National Beef Retail Report as a baseline. We also noted the various styles and grades available at each store on our list, which created a price range for many cuts.

Title: Despite some initial skepticism, could Target’s turnaround be right on target?
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/10/who-is-new-target-ceo-michael-fiddelke-succession-turnaround/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T14:08:37Z
Full Content:
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. The old proverb “new brooms sweep clean” is often misleadingly mentioned to suggest that new hires are more thorough. That drops the cautionary second part of the proverb that should not be ignored: “but an old broom knows the corners.” The wisdom of the full saying rings especially true when considering how the nascent turnaround effort at iconic retail chain Target appears to be coming into focus, despite widespread initial skepticism. While the path forward remains challenging, could Target’s turnaround be right on target despite all the naysayers? That skepticism apparently ran so deep, that merely two months ago, when Target announced that longtime, widely admired CEO Brian Cornell would be retiring and that 20-year company veteran Michael Fiddelke would take the reins, the stock immediately plummeted 8%, with sellside Wall Street analysts commenting that “investors were hopeful for an external hire,” and “this internal appointment does not remedy the problems of entrenched groupthink and inward-looking mindset.” (Target stock is down by more than one-third year-to-date.) Despite Fiddelke’s resume – having originally started at Target over two decades ago as an intern, and working in practically every job at the company across retail, merchandising, operations, finance, and supply chain since – many seemed to have written him off from the start, primarily by virtue of his insider status. But could that have been premature? It’s understandable that investors often have a knee-jerk preference for outsiders to parachute into companies in turbulent times. We acknowledge there is never any one-size-fits-all solution – there are always certain situations where an outsider may be genuinely necessary to shake things up and clear the deck. For example, Cornell himself came to Target from PepsiCo when Target was mired in crisis amidst a costly data breach and plummeting revenues, and he got Target back to growth within a couple of years. But our new, original analysis of recent Fortune 500 CEO successions suggests that surprisingly, internal CEOs have been consistently outperforming external CEOs, with dramatic outperformance in terms of total shareholder return (TSR). We analyzed all CEO transitions taking place in the Fortune 500, and we found that of the 61 CEO transitions which took place over the last year, the 39 CEOs who were elevated from within, have generated an average TSR of 14.81% on an annualized basis, while the 22 CEOs who were selected from the outside have generated an average TSR of -9.01% on an annualized basis. Could that be a one-year fluke? We ran the numbers over a longer-term period, and found that the same trend consistently held true. We found that of the 93 CEO transitions which took place over the last one to three years, the 71 internal CEOs have generated a 10.16% average annualized return, while the 22 external CEOs have generated a 6.35% average annualized return. Likewise, of the 84 CEO transitions in the Fortune 500 which took place over the last three to five years, the 70 internal CEOs have generated a 12.68% average annualized return while the 13 external CEOs have generated a 6.42% average annualized return. Simply put, the data is clear that no matter how you slice and dice it, there has been dramatic stock outperformance by internal CEOs vs. external CEOs when it comes to recent Fortune 500 CEO transitions. The conclusions drawn from our original analysis of recent CEO performance closely parallel the findings of other renowned management and corporate governance scholars. In his 2007 book, “The CEO Within,” Harvard Business School’s Joseph Bower found that externally recruited CEOs often lack the in-depth knowledge of the company’s culture and history needed to succeed. Similarly, Stanford’s David Larcker and Brian Tayan found that the data consistently shows across decades that internal CEOs outperform external CEOs. Many scholars have found the same conclusion holds true over more discrete time periods even beyond the ones we measured, such as during the COVID pandemic. While there is never a one-size-fits-all prescription that works in all cases, the data seems to suggest that the greatest change agent CEOs tend to come from within – internal CEOs tend to have a deep understanding of their company, what makes it tick, and even more importantly, where the bodies are buried, and what needs to change – and with the know-how, cultural savvy, and buy-in needed to make tough decisions on day one. As he retires, Brian Cornell has much to be proud of as one of the most admired and accomplished CEOs in retail. During his decade-plus tenure, he has transformed Target from a beleaguered company beset by crises when he arrived, into a retail powerhouse with over $100 billion of revenue today; successfully transitioned Target into an omnichannel retailer with significant e-commerce capabilities; reinvigorated the company’s lucrative, higher-margin private brand business to the tune of more than $30 billion a year in sales; and expanded the company’s geographic footprint to nearly 2,000 fully owned stores. And while the current stock price doesn’t reflect all these achievements, he has bought back billions in stock while raising the dividend every year during his tenure; all while continuing Target’s commitment to dedicating 5% of its total profits to communities, which it has done without break since 1946. Cornell’s prescient, industry-leading strategy to invest in stores in 2017 to build them into e-commerce fulfillment hubs paid off massively, enabling exponential e-commerce growth at Target, especially early on during the pandemic, with consumers embracing Target’s same-day home delivery and drive by pick-up service. This business, which was virtually built from scratch, now generates $20 billion a year and is still rapidly growing. Derived from Target’s burgeoning e-commerce platform is Target’s digital advertising business, which now generates $2 billion a year for the company and is still rapidly growing as well. At the same time, the complexity of running stores as distribution centers has created gaps in the store experience, and Target needs to provide consumers with a more premium, consistent shopping experience. Fiddelke will need to navigate a challenging road forward for Target, which has seen sales stagnate since peaking three years ago. Target has a higher mix of consumer discretionary products vis a vis competitors such as Walmart and Costco, whose product mix lean more towards consumer staples. This benefits Target when its merchandise is trend setting and differentiated, but can also be a headwind when consumers are stretched or managing budgets tightly. Fiddelke’s emphasis on restoring Target’s style authority may be the biggest factor in driving future growth here. Regardless, there is just no mistaking the magnitude of Target’s current challenges. To succeed, Fiddelke will need to put forward a comprehensive turnaround strategy as 2026 beckons, with the planned CEO transition looming in February 2026. Consumer spending is showing signs of slowing down amidst market share losses to key competitors, and Target will need to do a better job of both providing value to the financially stressed consumer; while also better differentiating its discretionary products to recapture higher spending consumers. Target needs to recapture its reputation for combining style, quality and value in a way other retailers don’t. There are some potential growth enhancers. While Target’s loyalty program, Target Circle, has over 100 million members; investors will be looking to see how Fiddelke can better leverage those memberships. Unlike Walmart or Amazon, Target Circle is free to join, and there is a big opportunity for Target to increase the offerings and value to attract more consumers while further monetizing the platform. Target has been testing different promotions, personalized offers, gamifying rewards, free gifts and working to increase awareness of the benefits, with a focus of driving upper-level paid premium memberships that come with 5% discounts on purchases and unlimited same-day home delivery. These initiatives have the potential to not only accelerate digital growth but also drive overall traffic and sales growth. Similarly, there is a significant opportunity for Target’s third-party marketplace business, Target+, which enables outside vendors to sell products on its website with attractive profit margins to Target, to grow significantly in the years ahead. Fiddelke appears to be meeting these challenges head-on. Virtually all observers agreed that the recent news of Target laying off 8% of its corporate workforce was difficult but necessary in rightsizing Target’s workforce. Analysts at Jefferies noted, “This is an early signal that Fiddelke is willing to make tough calls. The layoffs are essential to restore agility and cost discipline. If paired with initiatives to reignite traffic and improve digital execution, these actions could lay the groundwork for a turnaround”. These initial green shoots of progress have been warmly welcomed, with Target stock up nearly 10% over the last month. Furthermore, Target is continuing exclusive premiers with blockbuster talent like Taylor Swift, who just released her new “Life of Showgirl” album with exclusive related merchandize items available only at Target, continuing a highly profitable enviable relationship since 2008. But that marks only the start, and much more is needed. To sustain momentum, Target will need to communicate an even more sweeping, comprehensive turnaround strategy covering all aspects of Fiddelke’s new strategy in detail, perhaps around a potential investor day next spring. Clearly, there is strong appetite for bold, decisive moves, even if it means ripping off the band-aid right up front and working through some transitory pain. Then, from there, all eyes will be on execution. While our original analysis suggests that internal CEOs tend to have stronger track records of execution, the onus will be on Fiddelke to show that this leadership team of experienced Target veterans can hit the bulls-eye once Target’s target is in sight.

Full Content:
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. The old proverb “new brooms sweep clean” is often misleadingly mentioned to suggest that new hires are more thorough. That drops the cautionary second part of the proverb that should not be ignored: “but an old broom knows the corners.” The wisdom of the full saying rings especially true when considering how the nascent turnaround effort at iconic retail chain Target appears to be coming into focus, despite widespread initial skepticism. While the path forward remains challenging, could Target’s turnaround be right on target despite all the naysayers? That skepticism apparently ran so deep, that merely two months ago, when Target announced that longtime, widely admired CEO Brian Cornell would be retiring and that 20-year company veteran Michael Fiddelke would take the reins, the stock immediately plummeted 8%, with sellside Wall Street analysts commenting that “investors were hopeful for an external hire,” and “this internal appointment does not remedy the problems of entrenched groupthink and inward-looking mindset.” (Target stock is down by more than one-third year-to-date.) Despite Fiddelke’s resume – having originally started at Target over two decades ago as an intern, and working in practically every job at the company across retail, merchandising, operations, finance, and supply chain since – many seemed to have written him off from the start, primarily by virtue of his insider status. But could that have been premature? It’s understandable that investors often have a knee-jerk preference for outsiders to parachute into companies in turbulent times. We acknowledge there is never any one-size-fits-all solution – there are always certain situations where an outsider may be genuinely necessary to shake things up and clear the deck. For example, Cornell himself came to Target from PepsiCo when Target was mired in crisis amidst a costly data breach and plummeting revenues, and he got Target back to growth within a couple of years. But our new, original analysis of recent Fortune 500 CEO successions suggests that surprisingly, internal CEOs have been consistently outperforming external CEOs, with dramatic outperformance in terms of total shareholder return (TSR). We analyzed all CEO transitions taking place in the Fortune 500, and we found that of the 61 CEO transitions which took place over the last year, the 39 CEOs who were elevated from within, have generated an average TSR of 14.81% on an annualized basis, while the 22 CEOs who were selected from the outside have generated an average TSR of -9.01% on an annualized basis. Could that be a one-year fluke? We ran the numbers over a longer-term period, and found that the same trend consistently held true. We found that of the 93 CEO transitions which took place over the last one to three years, the 71 internal CEOs have generated a 10.16% average annualized return, while the 22 external CEOs have generated a 6.35% average annualized return. Likewise, of the 84 CEO transitions in the Fortune 500 which took place over the last three to five years, the 70 internal CEOs have generated a 12.68% average annualized return while the 13 external CEOs have generated a 6.42% average annualized return.

Stock futures are surging this morning after U.S. lawmakers passed a key procedural hurdle as part of an agreement that could bring an end to the shutdown that has lasted nearly six weeks; President Donald Trump has proposed issuing $2,000 “dividend” checks to Americans that would be funded by revenue from tariffs; AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV) is set to release its quarterly results after the closing bell today; and shares of Metsera (MTSR) are plunging after the weight-loss drug maker announced that it would be acquired by Pfizer (PFE) after a bidding war with Novo Nordisk (NVO). Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a higher open for major indexes after the Senate passed a key procedural vote as part of an agreement to end the more-than-month-long U.S. government shutdown. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were recently up 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively, while those linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.5%. The major market indexes lost ground last week amid cooling momentum behind the AI trade and heightened worries over the shutdown. Bitcoin was at nearly $106,000 in recent trading, up from a low over the weekend of around $101,500 and trading at its highest level in a week. Gold futures rose more than 2% to a two-week high of just above $4,100 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences a range of consumer loans, was at 4.13%, up from Friday's close of 4.09%. The Senate on Sunday passed a procedural hurdle that could clear a path for the government to reopen after the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The Senate voted 60-40 on a measure that allows other votes on an agreement that could restore funding to government agencies that have been shuttered for more than 40 days. Eight Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the agreement that would open the government through the end of January. While the agreement doesn’t address the healthcare funding cuts that were at the center of the shutdown, news reports said that there will be a vote on the subsidies in December. One consequence of the shutdown has been a freeze on economics reports from government statistical agencies, which could affect reports this week on inflation and retail sales. Government officials also began restricting some air travel last week amid staffing issues for air traffic controllers. President Donald Trump proposed issuing a $2,000 stimulus payment to Americans, saying in a social media post that tariff revenues could be used to fund the checks. “We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” In his post, Trump defended his tariff policies, which are currently being challenged in a Supreme Court case that challenges his authority to issue the import taxes. Earlier this year, allies of President Trump had proposed a "DOGE dividend” from savings from spending cuts. Artificial intelligence data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report after markets close today, giving investors another look at the AI trade amid recent volatility. CoreWeave recently has announced a handful of deals with top tech firms, including a $6.3 billion initial order with AI chipmaker Nvidia and a $14.2 billion agreement with social media giant Meta. CoreWeave is expected to report that its revenue more than doubled over the year-ago period to $1.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. The firm is expected to post an adjusted loss per share of $0.35. Shares of CoreWeave, which have gained 160% since the company's initial public offering in March, were up nearly 5% in premarket trading. Shares of Metsera (MTSR) are plunging after the weight-loss drug maker announced that Pfizer (PFE) has agreed to acquire the company. Metsera said that it struck the deal with Pfizer after U.S. regulators raised worries that an offer from Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk (NVO) would create antitrust issues. The deal follows a reported bidding war between the two drug makers for New York-based Metsera. Pfizer will pay $86.25 per share in the transaction, which is reportedly valued at more than $10 billion. Metsera shares were down 15% ahead of the opening bell, while Pfizer shares ticked higher.

Title: When the AI Bubble Bursts, the Damage Will Be Severe

Time Published: 2025-11-10T13:00:00Z

The AI bubble is both massive and nearing its end. At least that’s how we read the tea leaves. When it bursts…the damage is going to be profound, financially, economically and even politically. The AI bubble has gotten so massive and so complicated and so perversely organized that even the WSJ is having trouble figuring out how to describe the circular deals and money flows. When this bubble bursts, it will be the most damaging in US history, by far. The amounts involved are truly staggering, measured in the supposed market valuations of the top 5 companies – Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, and Google. Together, they are ‘worth’ more than $19 trillion. Nvidia alone is valued in the stock market at more than $5 trillion. But let’s back up for a moment. What is a bubble? This is my favorite definition: “A bubble exists when asset prices rise beyond what incomes can sustain.” Using this definition, consider AI leader OpenAI, which has a purported $13 billion in yearly revenue, but which is losing billions more on top of that, having made capital spending commitments with other AI companies totaling $1.4 trillion. The value of all the other involved companies has spiked on the news of the commitments, but where is that money going to come from? Nobody has yet said and OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, refuses to answer: Sam Altman appears tired of having to justify how OpenAI will pay for its trillion-dollar-plus spending commitments as a startup bringing in a fraction of that in annual revenue. In a testy moment during a recent podcast interview with investor Brad Gerstner on the “Bg2 Pod,” Altman was asked “the single biggest question” that is “hanging over the market.” “How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?” Gerstner asked the OpenAI CEO. “You’ve heard the criticism, Sam.” OpenAI has invested heavily in infrastructure and compute, striking multi-billion-dollar deals to secure more Nvidia chips and energy to fuel its AI ambitions. The latest came Monday morning, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion partnership with AWS. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” Altman said in response to Gerstner’s question. “Enough.” (Source) It’s extremely weird for a CEO to refuse to answer the most basic of questions about their business model. Unless, of course, that CEO already knew there was no good answers to be given and was being evasive in an attempt to buy some time while they try to sort out a revenue model. In other words, the asset price of his company has risen far beyond what incomes can sustain. The day after recording this podcast with Paul Kiker, Sam Altman tipped his hand further by – I am not making this up – requesting that US taxpayers guarantee the gargantuan loans he needs in order to continue his money-losing project: Sam Altman over at OpenAI wants the US government to provide and guarantee loans for its expansion.Up to a trillion.No, I’m not joking. pic.twitter.com/i4XRjpPPQn On top of that, we’ve also got the CEO of Nvidia now warning that China may ‘win’ the AI race (whatever that means). JUST IN – Nvidia founder Jensen Huang says, "China is going to win the AI race." — Financial Times The pattern is worryingly the same as we saw right before the internet bubble burst in 2000. I see a pattern…Altman and Jenson smell the end of bubble (financing drying up) and are going to ask Daddy for taxpayer money citing national security issues. https://t.co/d8l30BRFSj pic.twitter.com/ASHRJZkcMu And this is the same behavior observed before the infamous South Sea Bubble of the 1700’s blew up. My favorite pitch for South Sea shares? “The company is being formed for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.” (Source) That, at least, was direct and honest. I’m getting the same vibes today from Sam Altman. Meanwhile, the actual economy, the one based on real products being made, transported and sold to real people, is shredding at an alarming rate. Freightwaves CEO: "Well, we should be worried. The goods economy, certain portions of the goods economy are collapsing right now. So, year over year trucking volumes, this is really predominance of freight that moves across the United States, is down 17%". "But when you look at… pic.twitter.com/DuCIgJNjWS This is why, when the AI bubble bursts, the damage will be so severe. There’s no solid support beneath it. The real economy is suffering with job layoffs for October the highest since 2003: Layoffs in October were the highest since 2003: pic.twitter.com/QnQ33KFyGZ And that’s with $2+ trillion of government deficit spending, the Fed cutting rates, and financial conditions being extremely easy as M2 grows.

Title: Best Altcoins Like SUBBD Token Amp Up as BlackRock Stays Bitcoin-Bullish

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Bitcoin’s cooled off after ripping to six figures, and macro noise from Washington’s prolonged shutdown hasn’t helped risk appetite. Yet the world’s largest asset manager (BlackRock) isn’t blinking. Instead, it frames Bitcoin as a long-duration, structural bet anchored by network adoption, deeper liquidity, and the slow erosion of legacy money systems. And flows back it up. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) became the fastest U.S. ETF to surpass roughly $80B in assets and has since solidified its position at the top of the spot $BTC ETF stack. Translation: despite choppier price action, institutions are still dollar-cost-averaging Bitcoin via regulated rails. And with the U.S. shutdown now trudging toward a resolution, the policy overhang looks more like a speed bump than a trend shift. And over a week ago, BlackRock’s IBIT surpassed Coinbase’s Deribit platform and became the largest Bitcoin options venue in the world. For traders watching risk rotations, that matters. When majors grind sideways but the strategic case remains intact, capital looks at early-stage projects with promising utility. We’re talking about a bid on the best altcoins, and that’s where SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is trying to earn attention: a content-and-AI play that leans into content tokenization and the creator commerce industry, with fan engagement mechanics. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) isn’t just another presale pitch; it’s a creator toolkit built to do real work. The platform integrates AI assistants, voice cloning, and automated livestreaming into a single workflow, allowing you to script, produce, and publish with fewer tabs and fewer late nights. Fans receive clean, token-gated access to premium drops and livestreams, while you set flexible pricing, bundles, and perks that align with how your audience engages. Engagement feeds XP multipliers slot into raffles and simple games, turning passive viewers into committed members. You spend less time juggling calendars and more time shipping content: the AI helpers handle repetitive admin, so a larger share of each subscriber dollar lands where it should. The payoff is practical: faster production cycles, smoother paywalls, and stickier communities that come back for access, not hype. In a market tired of promises, a platform that saves time and deepens fan relationships is the utility that travels in any cycle. Plus, there’s a lot to look forward to, like strategic partnerships for marketing, enhanced AI image generation, the HoneyHive, and the release of the Creators mobile app. In a market that’s increasingly allergic to vapor, this is the kind of utility-first framing that can still resonate even when $BTC cools off. Visit the $SUBBD presale page to join. Presales live or die on incentives and clarity. In $SUBBD’s case, transparency is evident – over $1.3M has been raised so far, with the current stage pricing at $0.0569. Staking is another hook: tokens staked during the sale earn a fixed 20% APY for the first year per the whitepaper, shifting to platform-benefit staking thereafter. That’s high, but as always, view it as an early-stage incentive to bootstrap participation rather than a permanent yield regime. To join the presale, follow our $SUBBD buying guide. The presale accepts $USDT, $BNB, $ETH, $USDC, and fiat via a debit card. If BlackRock’s steady-hand view maintains a constructive backdrop while $BTC fluctuates, presales with immediate product hooks, such as $SUBBD, have a cleaner path to narrative alignment. ➡️ Grab your $SUBBD now.

Companies are simultaneously announcing record AI investments and widespread layoffs, often for the same organizations. While AI is cited as a driver for these cuts, many initiatives show no return on investment. Layoffs, especially large ones, can undermine innovation and employee morale, potentially hindering the very AI adoption they aim to facilitate.

Title: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Price & RTX 50 SUPER Launch Rumors: AICs Yet To Receive Plans, G7 Memory Prices Raised
URL: https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-price-rtx-50-super-launch-rumors-aics-yet-to-recieve-plans-g7-memory-prices-raised/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T11:55:29Z
Full Content:
70% Probable Source 4/5 Corroboration 3/5 Technical 4/5 Timeline 3/5 There are various conflicting reports about the GeForce RTX 50 Super series, so it's best to take these reports with a grain of salt. Reports of DRAM getting expensive have reportedly affected the planned launch of the GeForce RTX 50 Super series. In our previous post, we mentioned that the GeForce RTX 50 Super series is reportedly delayed to Q3 2026, although it was previously planned to launch in Q1. One of the reasons is that GDDR7 memory is becoming more expensive. However, two more reports emerged today: one confirms the delayed launch while the other denies it altogether. However, NVIDIA revealed to AIC yesterday that it has not canceled the RTX 50 SUPER plan, but has temporarily postponed the release date of RTX 50 SUPER to Q3 2026. "Uniko's Hardware" is not correct. (Machine Translated) - HKEPC HKEPC states that the rumor about NVIDIA canceling the RTX 50 Super series is completely inaccurate, and NVIDIA has postponed the launch to Q3 2026, as previously mentioned. However, Benchlife says that both reports about cancellation and delayed launch are untrue. The reason cited here is the absence of any technical information with the AICs about the Super series. Benchlife says that since NVIDIA hasn't yet revealed any design information to its board partners, reports on the launch of RTX 50 Super series are nonsense. Our earlier report mentioned that NVIDIA has not yet given the design information of the GeForce RTX 50 Super series. As of November, no AIC has received the design information. Without any information, whether it is canceled or postponed, it is just nonsense. (Machine Translated) - Benchlife The GDDR7 prices have indeed increased, but there appears to be no link between the RTX 50 Super series postponement and the higher GDDR7 prices. Moreover, it's NVIDIA that ships the GDDR7 modules to its board partners along with the GPU dies, and it's NVIDIA that has reportedly raised the prices of the memory. Prominent leaker @Zed__Wang says that he doesn't know what caused this, and whether popular memory makers like Hynix, Samsung, and Micron have increased the DRAM prices. I don’t know the situation between NVDA and Hynix/Samsung/Micron, but NVDA raised the GDDR7 price when it sold to AICs in the past few weeks. NVDA sells GPU dies and memory together to the AICs, AICs do not directly purchase memory from Hynix/Samsung/Micron. It's pretty late as a refresh product, but I think NVDA will try to prolong the life cycle of the entire RTX50, so maybe it's okay for them. Nonetheless, the reports about the GeForce RTX 50 Super series launch remain under wraps. Since AICs haven't received the technical information about the series, and we are just two months away from CES, it's safe to say that NVIDIA might be releasing the new family later in 2026.

Daily news & progressive opinion—funded by the people, not the corporations—delivered straight to your inbox. An aerial view of a 33 megawatt data center with closed-loop cooling system is seen on October 20, 2025 in Vernon, California. AI’s massive energy use is giving fossil fuels a lifeline when they should be rapidly phased out in response to the climate emergency. What started as rivulets of hype, hope, and alarm over artificial intelligence have combined into a tsunami-level wave washing over the American consciousness. ChatGPT is the most downloaded application in history, AI stock prices are hitting record market highs, and the American public is giddy about its potential technological upsides and devastated by its role in mental health crises. Less discussed but deeply important are the AI boom’s clear and present dangers to our environment, health, and wallets. That lack of attention to these issues is exactly how President Donald Trump, Big Tech, and the oil and gas industry want it. As Trump attacks climate progress on all fronts, his administration is in lockstep pushing for a fast-tracked AI data center boom fed by gas and coal. It’s critical that AI become part of global climate negotiations—not as an escape hatch for how it could save the planet, but as an urgent threat to people, wildlife, and the atmosphere. It may not be immediately obvious, but AI is a gift to the fossil fuel industry. That’s because AI’s massive energy use is giving fossil fuels a lifeline when they should be rapidly phased out in response to the climate emergency. It’s a huge problem for world leaders as they gather in Brazil for this year’s annual global climate talks, known as COP30. In one of the biggest shifts since last year’s talks, data center expansion to feed energy-intensive AI is straining grids and leading companies and some countries to walk back domestic climate pledges. The Trump administration has cited the power-hungry AI beast as one big excuse for abandoning climate efforts, even as the US disproportionately leads the world in data center pollution. And the great AI energy suck is just getting started, with dozens of massive new data centers slated for construction across the country—and hundreds more around the world. Mark Zuckerberg says one Meta data center will be the size of Manhattan. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said recently, “I do guess that a lot of the world gets covered in data centers over time.” These data centers demand immense amounts of power, land, and water for cooling. As one point of comparison, a ChatGPT AI search consumes 10 times as much energy as a normal Google search. Just how bad could data center expansion be for the climate? That’s what we set out to find in our report, Data Crunch: How the AI Boom Threatens to Entrench Fossil Fuels and Compromise Climate Goals. We found that plans for US data center growth, set to be powered primarily by fossil gas, as well as notoriously dirty coal, could triple by 2035. That comes with a huge cost to efforts to preserve a livable planet and limit the deadly flooding, extreme heat, and destructive fires of the climate emergency. Unchecked, the fossil-fueled data center expansion could account for 10% of US economy-wide emissions and 44% of the power sector emissions allowable to meet the US climate target under the Paris Agreement. With a gas-fed AI boom, all other electricity-consuming sectors, like homes and buildings, would need to cut their emissions by 60% more to keep pace with that target, set by former President Joe Biden and still in effect under Paris Agreement terms. Amid all the hype and seeming inevitability of AI dominance, human beings have a chance now to proactively consider what relationship we want with this technology—and the environmental price we’re willing to pay. If new AI data centers were instead powered by renewables like solar and wind, they’d be only 4% of power sector emissions and would barely affect our ability to meet the US climate goal. Despite Trump exiting the Paris Agreement, Biden’s target stands as the United States’ contribution to global efforts to combat climate change. While Trump dismisses climate change as a “con job,” there is broad scientific agreement that every degree of global heating worsens its deadly, destructive effects on people and wildlife. A study last month found that accelerating climate harms mean that half a million people now die every year from extreme heat—an average of one person a minute. The unbridled expansion of data centers to feed AI will only further intensify such fatal consequences and others, including crop loss to drought, spread of disease, and loss of imperiled plants and animals. These consequences are exactly what world leaders gathered in Belem, Brazil, for COP30 are trying to prevent, by limiting global heating by every fraction of a degree that they can. That goal can’t be achieved without serious guardrails on AI data center development. It’s critical that AI become part of global climate negotiations—not as an escape hatch for how it could save the planet, but as an urgent threat to people, wildlife, and the atmosphere. Before AI unleashes a fresh hell of global heating, countries should commit to zeroing out the emissions from data centers by using renewable energy and storage. From Virginia to Tucson to Kosciuko County, Indiana, communities around the country have sprouted near-overnight campaigns to protect their water and electricity from being consumed by data centers and to prevent rate hikes to subsidize two of the wealthiest industries on Earth. Besides playing defense, now is the time to be proactive and question whether data centers serve the public interest despite their many harms. If local communities still think so, they can pass strict regulations to ensure that data centers are powered fully by on-site renewable energy and batteries. If more power is needed, Big Tech companies can pay for residences to get rooftop solar and storage, heat pumps, and energy efficient appliances to free up capacity on the grid for data center neighbors. Amid all the hype and seeming inevitability of AI dominance, human beings have a chance now to proactively consider what relationship we want with this technology—and the environmental price we’re willing to pay. The COP30 climate talks will be a starting place for the world to look carefully at AI’s climate consequences. The tsunami of AI hype and the Trump destruction machine make for daunting foes. But they don’t have to wash away our resolve to leave this world better than we found it.

Unchecked, the fossil-fueled data center expansion could account for 10% of US economy-wide emissions and 44% of the power sector emissions allowable to meet the US climate target under the Paris Agreement. With a gas-fed AI boom, all other electricity-consuming sectors, like homes and buildings, would need to cut their emissions by 60% more to keep pace with that target, set by former President Joe Biden and still in effect under Paris Agreement terms. Amid all the hype and seeming inevitability of AI dominance, human beings have a chance now to proactively consider what relationship we want with this technology—and the environmental price we’re willing to pay. If new AI data centers were instead powered by renewables like solar and wind, they’d be only 4% of power sector emissions and would barely affect our ability to meet the US climate goal. Despite Trump exiting the Paris Agreement, Biden’s target stands as the United States’ contribution to global efforts to combat climate change. While Trump dismisses climate change as a “con job,” there is broad scientific agreement that every degree of global heating worsens its deadly, destructive effects on people and wildlife. A study last month found that accelerating climate harms mean that half a million people now die every year from extreme heat—an average of one person a minute. The unbridled expansion of data centers to feed AI will only further intensify such fatal consequences and others, including crop loss to drought, spread of disease, and loss of imperiled plants and animals. These consequences are exactly what world leaders gathered in Belem, Brazil, for COP30 are trying to prevent, by limiting global heating by every fraction of a degree that they can. That goal can’t be achieved without serious guardrails on AI data center development. It’s critical that AI become part of global climate negotiations—not as an escape hatch for how it could save the planet, but as an urgent threat to people, wildlife, and the atmosphere. Before AI unleashes a fresh hell of global heating, countries should commit to zeroing out the emissions from data centers by using renewable energy and storage. From Virginia to Tucson to Kosciuko County, Indiana, communities around the country have sprouted near-overnight campaigns to protect their water and electricity from being consumed by data centers and to prevent rate hikes to subsidize two of the wealthiest industries on Earth. Besides playing defense, now is the time to be proactive and question whether data centers serve the public interest despite their many harms. If local communities still think so, they can pass strict regulations to ensure that data centers are powered fully by on-site renewable energy and batteries. If more power is needed, Big Tech companies can pay for residences to get rooftop solar and storage, heat pumps, and energy efficient appliances to free up capacity on the grid for data center neighbors. Amid all the hype and seeming inevitability of AI dominance, human beings have a chance now to proactively consider what relationship we want with this technology—and the environmental price we’re willing to pay. The COP30 climate talks will be a starting place for the world to look carefully at AI’s climate consequences. The tsunami of AI hype and the Trump destruction machine make for daunting foes. But they don’t have to wash away our resolve to leave this world better than we found it.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. When historians look back at the PC industry in 2025, they’ll probably remember a time of intense turmoil. Between wildly unpredictable tariffs, geopolitical strife, the AI boom, hardware shortages caused by the AI boom (and tariffs), and hundreds of thousands of industry layoffs, it’s been an eventful – and stressful – year for the PC. Nonetheless, great things happened. We’ve seen the launch of entire new graphics card generations from Nvidia and AMD. The laptops of today are the laptops of tomorrow we’ve always dreamed of. Handheld gaming is exploding in popularity, leaving Microsoft scrambling to make Windows a viable alternative to Valve’s SteamOS on those devices. Security is evolving daily to protect a new breed of AI-powered attacks. Today is a day to celebrate the best of times. This is the Best PC Hardware and Software of 2025, as chosen by PCWorld’s editors. The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Aura Edition) is the most impressive Windows laptop we tested this year, and I’ll tell you exactly why. It combines a stunning 14-inch 2880×1800 OLED display with HDR and a 120Hz refresh rate, beastly specs (including an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and Intel Arc 140V graphics), and a battery that can last up to 23 hours. It’s speedy enough to handle work tasks and binge-watching your favorite show on Netflix and, at under three pounds, it won’t break your back. The 2-in-1 design is nice too, especially if you move around a lot. You can flip it into tablet mode or set it up like a little tent. This versatility is cool when you’re working with limited space like in an airplane seat, for example. The keyboard and trackpad also feel great, and the Yoga Pen sticks right to the top so it’s always handy when you’re ready to create your next masterpiece… or just doodle for fun! -Ashley Biancuzzo Nvidia bet the fate of the GeForce RTX 50-series on DLSS 4’s incredible multi-frame gen feature. As magical as the feature can be, it left most of the RTX 50 lineup feeling flat at best, or as uninspiring sidegrades at best. Not the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. Unlike most of the 50-series lineup, the 5070 Ti includes a sizeable performance uplift, while costing less – versus the 4070 Ti, you get 25 percent faster performance for $50 less. Better yet, the 5070 Ti’s prowess makes it the perfect vehicle for DLSS 4’s multi-frame gen – the card delivers killer 1440p and solid 4K performance as-is, but flipping on MFG takes visual smoothness and frame pacing to utterly sublime levels. You’re going to want to pair this beast with a 240Hz monitor if you can manage it. In a weak and price-engorged generation for graphics cards, only the RTX 5070 Ti and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 series stand out as particularly appealing. The amazing power of DLSS 4 earns Nvidia this well-deserved nod. If you’re dismissing MFG as “fake frames,” you’re missing out. –Brad Chacos The battery life on the HP OmniBook 5 14 is utter insanity. We’re talking over 25 hours in our testing–you can thank the super-efficient Snapdragon X Plus processor for that one. The 14-inch 1920×1200 OLED touchscreen also looks great because of its wide color gamut and high contrast ratio. While it’ll breeze through most day-to-day tasks, it isn’t a gaming rig or a 3D workstation, so you may want to mind how you use it. That said, the main draw here is the ridiculous battery life and an OLED display that truly pops… all for under $900! This is one stunner of a laptop. -Ashley Biancuzzo This year, the monitor that stood out as the best overall – i.e., the monitor most likely to satisfy the versatile needs of the majority of users – was the Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED. Our high regard began with its big, sharp, colorful 4K QD-OLED panel. It grew with the 120Hz refresh rate and support for Adaptive Sync, making it a suitable option for work as well as entertainment, even gaming. With two video inputs (HDMI 2.1 and USB-C with DisplayPort 1.4 support), 90 watts of Power Delivery for connecting to either Windows or Mac laptops, and two USB-C downstream ports supporting 15 watts of USB Power Delivery and 5Gbps of data, it’s up for productivity. The monitor goes on to sweeten the pot with five speakers – wait, what? — for 25 total watts and support for spatial audio. Finally, it seals the deal with a price that undercuts the competition — $850 MSRP, but currently hovering around $700 on Amazon. – Katherine Stevenson Staying sane while dealing with online security is much easier with a password manager. A good password manager, that is—one that quickly creates and fills in strong passwords, stores passkeys, immediately alerts you to compromised or weak passwords, and lets you securely share credentials with others. Dashlane gets the highest possible marks from us not just for its dependability, but its regular updates, too. In particular, the service now supports full passwordless login, which lets you sign in to your Dashlane account without a password. It’s also one of the first to implement secure import/export of passkeys and passwords (aka CXP). This puts it on the leading edge of credential security—other password managers are still working on their rollout. Combined with standard features like passkey support and dark web monitoring, plus surprising extras like VPN access and real-time phishing protection, Dashlane provides a lot of broad protection for your logins. Other password managers may be cheaper, but not as complete. -Alaina Yee You might expect our pick for best SSD to use the latest-gen PCIe 5.0 interface, which can be 100 percent faster than the previous generation. But while the prospect of such blazing-fast transfer speeds is certainly tantalizing, for most everyday computing activities, including gaming, PCIe 4.0 performs comparably to PCIe 5.0 — and for a lot less money! This is why our pick for best SSD is the WD Black SN7100 SSD, a PCIe 4.0 drive whose overall benchmark performance bested those of its peers, even if only by small margins. The upshot is that this drive is fast, and it features a reassuring five-year warranty. Better still, at $74 for 1TB, it’s half the cost of the best PCIe 5.0 drive. Need we say more? – Katherine Stevenson Adam Patrick Murray / Foundry It’s been a slow year for CPUs. Perhaps in reaction to 2024’s performance issues and regressions, both Intel and AMD have been quiet on the desktop front. Instead, focus has been on laptop CPUs. The lone bright spot for desktop enthusiasts? AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X3D. We saw it coming. Last year, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivered stupendous performance in both gaming and content creation. A flagship version would be even beastlier—and the 9950X3D proved that assumption right. Against the Intel Core 9 285K, the 9950X3D showed gaming performance lifts ranging from 25 to 48 percent (!) and a content creation performance boost of about 10 percent on average. And that’s at stock settings. Turn on PBO and you get another bump in performance. The only disappointing thing about the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is that it takes the title with no real competition. But that doesn’t make it a bad chip. On its own merits—and no matter what kind of PC user you are—it’s a win. -Alaina Yee I expected 2025 to be a breakout year for Thunderbolt 5 docking stations, and I wasn’t disappointed. Many docks I received, however, were priced at the high end of the spectrum. Plugable’s TBT-UDT3 was a notable exception, a moderately-priced laptop docking station I could recommend to those who needed a current-generation Thunderbolt 4 dock or who were looking to invest in next-gen Thunderbolt 5 hardware. Why did I weigh price so heavily? Two reasons: first, the omnipresent tariff concerns, and second, because Intel has reserved (again!) Thunderbolt 5 as a discrete add-on component, making it the domain of high-end, premium laptops, and not the mainstream. Eventually, that will change. But Plugable gives you tomorrow’s hardware at today’s prices. Plugable’s docking station offers the choice of three displays (or two plus an external SSD), Thunderbolt Share, and a general overall stability that unfortunately isn’t that commonplace. I think it’s the best overall docking station I tested, even though others had standout features that I ranked highly. –Mark Hachman Data breaches keep piling up. So too attacks via phishing links and malware. AI may be helping people with dinner recipes and email writing, but it has also sped up the discovery of vulnerabilities—and exploits of them. Even with good online browsing habits, the most careful person can still fall prey to common tricks. You need a safety net. That’s why we love Norton 360 Deluxe. You could stitch together your own equivalent suite yourself, but this antivirus app pulls together and simplifies a very broad range of features for users. In addition to blocking malware and shady websites, Norton 360 Deluxe also offers dark web monitoring, a VPN, parental controls, a password manager, and 50GB of cloud storage for automated backups of critical documents. The subscription even includes general PC utilities like file cleanup, too. This highly comprehensive level of defense is rare—especially given how little Norton charges. You’ll be hard-pressed to find rivals that cost as little or provide as many features. -Alaina Yee Willis Lai / IDG If you want a solid, affordable handheld gaming PC…just get Valve’s Steam Deck. It’s nearly four years old now, but with a starting price of $400 and a “sweet spot” OLED upgrade at $550, it’s still the best option out there for most gamers (especially if you pair the Steam Deck with a GeForce Now subscription, an utterly transformative duo). SteamOS, smoother and better integrated than Windows 11, is a big part of that. If you want a little more gaming power or a bigger screen, the Legion Go S comes with a SteamOS option that doesn’t require any tweaking…but maybe wait for a sale. –Michael Crider For those who want a lot more oomph and options, and don’t mind paying for it, the Lenovo Legion Go 2 is our pick. This beast of a handheld includes the larger screen and Switch-style breakaway controllers of the original design, plus an OLED upgrade and screaming Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor. It runs Windows 11, but Bazzite is a Steam-powered option (and probably official SteamOS, later). Just be prepared to pay for it: this thing starts at $1350 USD. –Michael Crider Not only did the Alienware 16X Aurora impress us with its raw performance, but its high refresh rate display also makes everything look positively delicious. This laptop is equipped to keep up with the latest titles thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU and RTX 5070 GPU. You can jump straight into the latest triple-A games without problem, with all the eye candy cranked, and they’ll play amazing. The 16-inch 2560×1600 IPS screen is crisp and big, and the 240Hz refresh rate makes every frame feel as smooth as silk. -Ashley Biancuzzo You might be surprised how much of your personal data is being collected and sold online. Data brokers and people search sites are hoovering up your data at an alarming rate and it’s nearly impossible to keep a lid on it yourself. So the best solution is to let a personal data removal service handle the arduous task of removing this data for you. And none are doing it better than Incogni. The service is dead simple to use, and the set-it-and-forget-it automation begins to work in a flash. After only the first day of using it, Incogni had already sent out hundreds of removal requests on my behalf, saving me months’ worth of effort. Plus, the service regularly follows up with every site to ensure my data doesn’t ever reappear. The addition of Custom removals means there is practically no site that Incogni won’t attempt to wipe your data from either. It can be a bit expensive, but if you’re concerned about your personal data being shared online, the piece of mind Incogni offers is unparalleled. –Sam Singleton For a gaming monitor to even warrant consideration, it needs to be fast and it needs to have a damn good picture. Those are just table stakes, which the MSI MPG 272URX delivers handily. Not content with the standard 1440p resolution, the 272URX goes full 4K for maximum clarity, and its 240Hz refresh rate renders even fast-paced games with buttery smoothness. Adaptive sync support is a given. But lest you think the 272URX’s talents begin and end with gaming, consider this: generous connectivity, including four video inputs, Power Delivery, and a KVM switch; a full complement of image-quality adjustments via a user-friendly on-screen menu; and HDR support. In sum, it’s an all-around winner. – Katherine Stevenson When it comes to Chromebooks, the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 is damned near flawless. It’s got an Intel i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, so it’s zippy when running everyday tasks, and the 14-inch 1080p touchscreen display looks sharp whether you’re cranking on daily workflows or zoning out to YouTube. It’ll also last around 13 hours on a single charge. You’ll get through a full workday, no problem – and with how great the keyboard feels, you won’t have any complaints while doing so. -Ashley Biancuzzo I am so glad I picked eMeet’s Piko+ 4K for our best webcam of 2025: the only flaw that I could find with this cute little 4K webcam is that it lacked a traditional webcam mount. Imagine my surprise when I double-checked my review and our shopping listings, only to discover that eMeet now ships a “traditional” version of this webcam, too! I absolutely loved the clarity that this dual-lens 4K webcam offered, especially in low light. This webcam’s visual capabilities were simply excellent (the mic is merely average, but that’s okay) and the $90 price splits the difference between our $40 budget webcams and the $150-$250 you’d pay for an ultrapremium offering. I wasn’t expecting much from this webcam, but I was blown away by what it offers. –Mark Hachman It’s never easy to select the best VPN overall. There are so many factors to consider such as privacy, ease of use, server network size, unblocking capabilities, and speed. The reasons people have for using a VPN varies widely and that all needs to be taken into account. Will the VPN be used to get around country blocks for streaming, staying anonymous online, torrenting, or something else—the list goes on and on. Many VPNs excel at a few of these functions, but rarely manage to shine across the board. That is, except NordVPN. It’s one of the only services that consistently ranks at the top, or close to it, of each category. That’s why it’s my pick for this year’s best VPN. Not only does it continue to be the fastest VPN I’ve ever tested, but it has a huge server network, a vast array of security extras, and its no-logs policy is backed by plenty of independent audits. It also never fails to unblock streaming services and fully supports P2P. No other current service exemplifies all of the elements of a great VPN like NordVPN, full stop. –Sam Singleton Each time I review Surfshark I’m amazed at the new and interesting features it adds to the service while maintaining such an inexpensive subscription price. At this point, I find myself asking, what doesn’t Surfshark have? Not only do you get the VPN with an outstanding server network and lightning-fast speeds, but you also have access to a whole slew of top-notch privacy and security extras such as multi-hop, antivirus protection, rotating IP, ad- and tracker-blocking, and more. The best part is that all of these great features and tools can be had for less than the price of a cup of coffee every month with Surfshark’s long-term plans. Even shady off-brand VPNs that market themselves as “cheap” barely offer subscriptions for this price—and none of them have the feature set or verified privacy record of Surfshark. It’s by far the best value VPN for those on a budget—and one of the best VPNs overall. –Sam Singleton For truly portable storage that can be carried with ease and used without the need for any additional cables or adapters, look no further than the Teamgroup X2 Max USB stick. This USB 3.2 Gen2 drive uses NVMe internals to deliver sustained transfers of approximately 1.1GBps. Sure, you can find portable drives that are even faster than that – USB 3.2×2 or USB4, for example. But they won’t feature this lil’ one’s unique flexibility in the form of dual connectors. With both USB-A and USB-C connectors, one on each end, you are assured of being able to plug into any device as-is. Now that’s convenience! – Katherine Stevenson This year, things got interesting in the backup software space. Our long-time favorite backup program was knocked from its perch by EaseUS Todo Backup 2025, which made impressive strides to achieve what our reviewer dubbed “the most efficient workflow I’ve seen.” He also described the interface as “a joy.” Wow. These are the kind of superlatives that make the tedious chore of backing up data much more welcoming. Of course, EaseUS Todo Backup 2025 provides all the necessary functionality you need for complete confidence: whole drive and partition imaging, file and folder backup, sync, disaster recovery including a WinPE recover disk, and more. We also love that EaseUS bucks the trend by offering a perpetual licence ($59.99, or $79.99 for lifetime upgrades) in addition to a yearly subscription ($39.99). Although, to take advantage of EaseUS’s optional cloud storage at a respectable $20 per year for 1TB, you will need to opt for the subscription tier. – Katherine Stevenson It makes a lot of sense to use an online backup service. In the context of the trusty 3-2-1 rule for backups, an online backup suffices as one of the two distinct types of media that’s suggested, as well as checks the box that a backup be kept in a remote location. What’s really great about iDrive, our pick for best online backup service, is that it offers even more than that, such as a client for local backups and basic imaging and disaster recovery, which is pretty rare among online services. The Personal tier, which starts at $69.65 per year, has support for multiple devices and includes 5TB of online storage. With its comprehensive feature set and user-friendliness, iDrive is tough to beat. – Katherine Stevenson Most USB-C hubs are dongles: you get a long rectangular slab of plastic or aluminum about the length of a utility knife, with a number of ports attached. OWC’s Travel Dock looks a bit more like a docking station without the size of a docking station. It’s only 3.2 inches on a side, and ports sprout from all three sides of this 5-in-1 hub: USB-A, Ethernet, USB-C power input, HDMI, and an SD card reader. Even the cord tucks away. For about $35 ($30 as I write this) you get the most important four ports you’ll need, all in a compact little square that still fits inside a pouch, purse, or pack. Or…perhaps a stocking? –Mark Hachman Brad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

US stock market futures today surged as optimism built over Washington’s progress on ending the record 2025 government shutdown. Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures climbed sharply after the Senate cleared a 60–40 procedural vote on a short-term funding deal through January 2026. The move boosted risk appetite and sent global markets higher, with KOSPI up 3%, Nikkei 1.3%, and Hang Seng 1.5%. Tech rebounded, led by Nvidia, while energy and financial stocks gained. The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 4.13% as investors rotated back into equities.

Δ Maybe an innovation saved a lot of our time. Or it made us live longer. Made us more productive workers who could command a higher premium on our time. Or enabled us to pack more things into the limited time we have. Some innovations have done most of the above. Innovations in time have massively improved and extended our lives over the last several centuries. And there’s no letting up. The next wave of disruption will come from those who deliberately innovate around time. Those who see time not as the tick of fixed seconds, but as a human asset whose value has almost unlimited potential. To find inspiration for the next breakthrough, decacorn, and more, catalysts should study time. No asset is more valuable, or more limited, than time. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Each day, we get just so much. Twenty-four hours, 1,440 minutes, 86,400 seconds. If we don’t use it, we lose it. So, we try to make the most of it. To do that, we trade it, swap it and compress it, each day and over our lifetimes. We can use some of our time endowment to work and make money to buy things. By using our time to learn when we are young, we can earn more money and enjoy our time more when we are older. Just like people value their houses and businesses value their capital stocks, people value their time. In the U.S., economic studies find that the average person values their time on earth at around $13 million. That is based on looking at how much people must be paid to take risks that could end their lives. The government uses that figure to evaluate benefits and costs involving lives. That makes the value of the stock of time for the U.S. population of 340 million people around $4.5 quadrillion (340.1 million people times $13.1 million per life). By comparison, the U.S. housing stock is worth a measly $55 trillion according to Zillow; the total fixed capital stock was worth $87 trillion in 2024 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis; and the total value of companies on public exchanges in the U.S. was $68 trillion at the end of September. A more precise estimate of the value of time would account for the fact that the value of life and life expectancy vary with age. But when you get to quadrillions, who’s really counting? Governments, businesses and innovators should treat time as what it truly is. A national and global asset. And like every other great asset, its value can grow through disruptive innovation. The better we use it, the richer the world becomes. Almost 90% of American farms didn’t have electricity as late as 1935. Robert Caro’s famous biography of Lyndon Johnson, “The Path to Power,” shows what that meant to the people living in Hill Country, Texas. A typical farm family used 40 gallons of water a day. To get it, they had to walk to a well located about 250 feet away with a bucket and carry it back to the house. A federal study found the average family spent about 500 hours a year and walked about 1,750 miles just to get water. The family devoted even more hours to hauling wood and washing clothes by hand. Tasks that consumed time and strength, especially for women who, literally, carried the heaviest load. More than half suffered physical injuries from the strain of constant standing and physical labor involved in doing both. Without electricity, there wasn’t much else to do. “No radio; no movies; limited reading—little diversion from the hard day just past and the hard day ahead,” according to Caro. “Living was just drudgery,” one person reminisced. Electrification changed all that, not just in Hill Country, but throughout the U.S. and eventually most of the world. People had more time. And more to do with that time. They could also expect to live longer as electrification reduced infant and adult mortality. Disruptive innovations can make time far more valuable. Entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses and governments have nine levers to find the next big thing in time. 1. Saving Time: Spending less time on one thing so you can spend it on another. Millennia ago, people learned to domesticate horses, which reduced the time spent traveling. Running water from electric pumps likely saved all 500 of those family hours fetching water. The invention of the washing machine reduced the amount of homemaker time to do a load of laundry from 4 hours to 41 minutes. E-commerce companies, from online retailers to meal delivery services, save people the time from traveling to and from physical locations or from cooking their own meals. 2. Making Time. Delaying the Grim Reaper’s visit as long as possible. Innovations like indoor plumbing created cleaner water and prevented the spread of disease. Vaccines largely ended many deadly diseases. The development of antibiotics saved lives. Surgical advances, imaging innovations, and drug development do too. Saving lives means extending the amount of time people have. Globally, average life expectancy increased from 32 years in 1900 to 73 years in 2023, more than doubling the amount of time people have. In the U.S., life expectancy increased from about 50 to almost 80. A perfect human specimen, with the best circumstances and the greatest luck, could make it until 125 based on the upper range for demographic studies. Using that data, in the U.S., we’ve reached only 64% of our potential. 3. Enriching Time. Packing more into the time you have. Electrification expanded the portion of the day people had light. That gave them more time to read and do things that are impossible to do in the dark. The printing press, and communication technologies from the telegraph to radio to broadband, have expanded the ability to benefit from our auditory and visual senses. Smartphones, powered by fast cellular, make those experiences on the go and on demand. Today we can listen to an audiobook, a podcast, or the radio while we’re driving, taking the subway or vacuuming the floors. 4. Monetizing Time. Using time to work to make money for people and their families. Innovations can change the amount of time people work. The time people spend working depends on whether they participate in the labor force, how many hours they work, and when they decide to retire. People can then use that money to buy goods and services, which they combine with their time (think about eating) to create value. The labor force participation of women has increased in the last century in part because household chores, which disproportionately fell on them, took up less time. People can work later in life because they are healthier and have more years available to them. Platforms make it possible for people to pick up gig jobs, participate in side hustles and work-from-home using their available time. Innovations often result in people being paid more because they are more productive. With higher incomes and savings, people can decide to work less and retire earlier, with greater incomes and more wealth. 5. Enjoying Time. Spending more time on leisure activities. The disruptive innovations for time saving and improving innovations have made leisure cheaper, because less time is needed for household chores, and more valuable, because sensory-related innovations provide better ways to spend their time. In 2024, the average American, age 15 and over, spent an average of 5.5 hours a day “in some sort of leisure and sport activity, such as watching TV, socializing, or exercising.” That’s about 37% of waking hours (the average number of hours sleeping was 9.0 hours). An economic study found that adults spent 6.75 more fewer hours a week working for pay or at home, and instead on leisure activities, between 1965 and 2003. This time was worth roughly 8% to 9% of GDP based on how much people could have made from paid work 6. Trading Time. Giving people things for free, or at a discount, in return for them giving some of their attention. Since newspapers were first invented, advertisers have been paying for people to pay attention to them. The idea is simple: advertisers buy space in media, hoping that audiences will notice their ads. People might not enjoy the ads, but they do enjoy the content. In exchange for free or cheaper access to that content, they let advertisers try to capture some of their attention. New media innovations have always created huge value by making leisure more enjoyable. Families in places like Hill Country, for instance, could spend hours listening to the radio or watching TV, paying nothing beyond the cost of the equipment and electricity. My 2020 paper on attention markets estimated that Americans spent about 500 billion hours consuming ad-supported content in 2019. That made the content they were consuming worth roughly $7 trillion, given the opportunity cost of their time. 7. Investing Time. Using time to learn and thereby increasing the value of time later in life. People, in most developed countries, invest a large part of their time through their teens, and often beyond, learning. This increases the value of their time, for working and themselves, later in their lives. A 2020 U.S. study by Fed economists found that kids, from kindergarten through high school, spent 36% of their waking hours over the week on class time and enrichment activities, including homework. (The data are from 1997, 2002, and 2007.) Investing in time differs in two main ways from the other levers of innovation. It’s not like choosing to watch TV, clean the house, or pick up hours with side hustles. In the U.S., and many countries, kids are compelled to invest time in learning by the government and by their parents. The logic is that it’s good for the kids and good for the country. Education hasn’t had a true disruption in centuries. Public schooling and standardized curricula were the last big innovations, and online learning has yet to deliver on its promise, with the exception of foreign languages. In 2024, grade 12 reading scores in the U.S. were the worst in three decades and math scores the lowest since 2005. 8. Accelerating Time. Shortening the time between the generation and delivery of information. People can make more and better decisions when they get information more quickly. Disruptive innovations have sharply decreased the time needed to convey information and, therefore, the choices people can make at any moment in time. Cheaper paper helped transmit information easily over long distances. The speed increased with the development of horse-based delivery services. In the U.S., sending mail on the stagecoach took weeks. The short-lived specialty Pony Express could move mail in days. It was replaced with the telegraph, which was nearly instantaneous aside from going to telegraph offices to send and retrieve messages. Economists have examined the value of faster time in commerce. Before the successful launch of the transatlantic telegraph on July 28, 1866, it took 7 to 16 days to send information between the U.S. and Great Britain. It was almost immediate after that. The faster transmittal times reduced the price spread for cotton between New York and Liverpool by 35%. By reducing price distortions, it resulted in economic efficiencies that were worth about 8.4% of the value of the exports. Of course, the internet and related communication technologies have massively accelerated time. Now it can take just a few seconds to buy from sellers around the world, to take just one example. 9. Multiplying Time. Increasing the total of the collective hours of everyone’s time, including their working time. Setting the warm and fuzzies aside, societies depend on the collective hours people spend working, creating, and paying taxes. People make the goods and services we consume or trade with other countries. People come up with the ideas that power innovation. And workers ultimately pay most of the taxes to finance everything from national defense to basic research to social welfare. Europe now faces an “existential crisis” in part because people work fewer hours and have fewer children, who will supply working time in the future. Most developed countries have increasingly severe time shortages and will eventually face crises too. Countries can multiply time by encouraging later retirement, higher workforce participation, longer hours, and immigration. The eight other innovations in time are important drivers. Countries can also try to encourage families to have more babies, but there’s not much evidence that works. Advanced applications of artificial intelligence might be the disruptive innovation we need to solve the great time shortage: it could create human substitutes and increase the productivity of human working time. We’re not ready to count humans out, though. Entrepreneurs, innovators and investors searching for their next breakthrough should treat time as a resource class: measurable, improvable and ripe for disruption. That goes for governments, too. The addressable market isn’t literally $4.5 quadrillion. But that is a proxy for the enormous potential of the nine levers to innovate time. And how even small gains in how we create, extend, or enhance it can generate enormous economic returns. Economists have developed clever data-driven methods for estimating the value that people place on their time that can help size investment opportunities and ROIs. We have put rigor into the old saying that “time is money.” Economists look at how much people have to be paid to give up time, say, for work. Or how much people will pay to save time, like for a faster commute. These aren’t ivory-tower exercises. They drive federal cost-benefit analysis of proposed investments. The simplest approach is based on wages. A person could go to the beach or do some chores around the house instead of working another hour. If they are willing to take $20 to work an extra hour for a gig job, then that must be more than the value of an hour doing something else. The wage-hour tradeoff is hard to pin down in practice because many people have fixed salaries or must work a set number of hours. But the after-average after-tax wage, about $17.83 now, turns out to be a good proxy for the value of time for the average person. Instacart claimed it saved people more than 700 million hours between 2012 and 2023 because they didn’t have to go to the grocery store. At $17.83 an hour, it saved people more than $1.2B. The value of time depends on the situation. An hour of work may be more or less pleasant. The time spent on a subway ride isn’t as costly if a person can listen to music on their smartphone. People hate standing in line at checkout, which is why many opt not to and order things online. To get context-specific estimates, economists conduct surveys that try to get people to reveal how much they value time spent in various activities. The U.S. Department of Transportation used these surveys to value savings in local personal travel at about $12.50 an hour. Recent studies estimate the value of spending time using social media. They find that you would have to pay people a lot to go without. Economists have also developed data-driven methods for putting a dollar value on extending life. People make many decisions that result in small changes in the probability of their dying. Many involve making tradeoffs between money and risk: paying extra for a safe car with lower fatality rates in crashes or taking a job that pays more but poses a great risk of a fatal accident. People don’t act as if their lives are worth an infinite amount of money. Most of the studies, and the most robust, look at job decisions. A review, based on 2017 data, found that an employer would have to pay a typical worker another $100 a year to take a job where 1 in 100,000 workers die from a work-related injury. To summarize these results, economists calculate the “value of a statistical life” as the total amount of money that a group of people would pay to avoid one death: 100,000 people would pay $10 million to save one life. The federal government uses this approach to estimate the benefit of investments in activities that could save or cost lives. They currently adopt the $13.1 million per life figure I used earlier. Economists have found that this figure varies across ages. Younger people have more years to value than older people. Economists also use this approach to value innovations in healthcare. A seminal economic study found that the increase in life expectancy between 1970 and 2000 “added about $3.2 trillion to national wealth per year, an uncounted value equal to half of average annual GDP over the period.” Not surprisingly, AI innovators are chasing improvements in healthcare. The real frontier of time isn’t just looking at a clock. It’s looking inside the brain, too. If you buy the Audible version, you can listen to my book, “Matchmakers,” with Richard Schmalensee. It will take you 6 hours and 53 minutes. We were surprised at how many people chose to do that. But the thing about audiobooks is that you can do lots of other things while you are listening. One survey found that 70% of listeners multitasked. A different survey found that 74% of audiobook listeners listen while driving. People also listen while engaging in lots of other activities, like running or doing household chores. They are packing more things into their heads at the same time. Lots of other time innovations do the same. When we talk about people’s time, we’re really talking about the mental processes that happen within a unit of time. What people do with their brains to consume media, work, learn, view ads and more. Economists and psychologists call these processes “attention.” That term covers what regular people call attention, but much more. (An excellent recent survey has the details.) Like money, attention is limited. Using it for one thing means giving it up for another. But unlike money, it’s powered by cognition and choice, and we can decide to engage in more mental activity. We decide what to do with our brains and senses and then do it. We can think of human time along two dimensions. One is clock time, the steady march of seconds. The other is attention per unit of time, which is the variable flow of mental energy that determines how much we accomplish within those seconds. (This is a simplification since attention has many dimensions itself.) Brain time is the flow of attention through the flow of time. This is where the nine levers of time innovation create immense value. Some of those levers give us more clock time, while others enrich attention. Often, they do both. And the beauty of brain time is that multiple levers can be processed during the same unit of time. Clever innovators can make a lot of money from brain time. Google search saved people clock time from going to the library and on other resources to get information. People could even listen to loud music or talk to their colleagues without getting yelled at by the librarian, which enriched their attention. People ended up spending a lot of time doing search queries and looking at search results pages. And they didn’t have to pay a penny. Google built its business on selling slivers of brain time to advertisers. Advertisers can put an ad on the page and have a chance that some people will pay attention. With Facebook and a smartphone, people could interact with friends anywhere anytime, including while watching TV or on the treadmill. Alphabet and Meta are worth about $5 trillion. They make almost all their revenue from the small percentage of visitors who divert brain time to ads. Focusing on time as an improvable asset, and the nine levers for increasing its value, gives entrepreneurs, innovators and businesses a rigorous, disciplined way to identify and size opportunities. It also hands governments a guide to make investments that will maximize the value of human time. The economics of brain time provides a new lens to help shape the innovations and value their potential. Some economists say the era of unprecedented growth has come to an end. After all, it’s hard to top indoor plumbing. I don’t think it’s over. The potential to improve and extend human time is enormous. The financial incentives are powerful. And AI and other new technologies provide the foundation for new leaps forward. It’s about time. David S.

Title: George Will Says Migrants -- Not Generation Z -- Will Revive America
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/10/george-will-says-migrants-not-young-americans-rejuvenate-america/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T08:58:31Z
Full Content:
Op-ed writer George Will, a pillar of the old-guard GOP establishment, is disgusted with Congress’s refusal to enforce more migration and used the Washington Post to air his grievances. Migrants “could improve the nation’s dynamism, and its understanding of itself. … [but] neither political party will seize the moment for immigration reform,” wrote Will, who was born in 1941, five years before the first Baby Boomers arrived in 1946, and 24 years before Congress restarted mass immigration in 1965 after a fifty-year shutdown. Will’s endorsement of more migration comes amid the growing public recognition of the economic damage caused by President Joe Biden’s inflow of illegal migrants and visa workers, including H-1Bs from India. The damage has exacerbated the widening optimism gap between older Americans and the younger Generation Z, of adults younger than forty. “Went to an event tonight, talked to three different people with zoomer kids,” said a Nov. 9 tweet from Rasmussen Reports pollster Mark Pitchell. “They’re demoralized.” “My friend group from high school, all graduated, great degrees from great schools,” recent graduate Nalin Haley told UnHerd, adding: It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one. So I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school. “I see Boomers are trying to make their counter-argument” towards younger Americans, said Rich Baris, director at Big Data Poll, and the chairman of the National Association of Independent Pollsters. He continued: It’s pretty damned insulting to listen to people in older generations act as if these younger generations have all the options and opportunities they did. They do not. Boomers made sure of it. It’s even more insulting to see fools quote “Locke” in some ridiculous attempt to threaten them for not submitting to their way of thinking. “In 10 years, there won’t even be an argument, and the younger generations will make sure history remembers you as the generation who inherited it all, and left nothing to be inherited,” Baris wrote. Older Americans gained housing values and stock-market wealth from the huge technological advances since the 1940s, and from the vast economic stimulus provided by Congress’s policy of stimulating the economy with vast waves of legal and illegal migrants. But young Americans have seen their wages flatline, their debts grow, and their housing costs spike amid the Boomers’ imported population of roughly 50 million legalized, quasi-legal, or illegal migrants. RELATED: Sean Duffy — Gavin Newsom’s California Is Ignoring the Law on Illegal Alien Truck Drivers Yet columnist Will, aged 84, is all-in for more migration, saying migrants can rejuvenate the economy by forcing Americans out of low-wage jobs: Immigrants who fill jobs as domestic helpers, cleaners, waiters, car-wash attendants, meatpackers and other low-skill jobs drive productivity and social dynamism by allowing, even compelling, other workers to advance to more-skilled work. Migrants can also act as servants to free up better-educated Americans for commerce and possible childbirth, says Will, who was 29 when migrants were just 5 percent of the population in 1970 Regarding America’s sagging birth rate, research finds that low-skill immigrants (nannies, housekeepers, meal-preparers) “substantially” reduce hesitation about having children. The flood of migrants — presumably including clan migrants from Somalia, casteist migrants from India, and Jew-hating Muslims from Syria — can replace complacent Americans because it will “improve the nation’s dynamism, and its understanding of itself,” said Will, who has an estimated net worth of $4 million and who voted for Vice President Kalama harris in 2024. The main danger, Will argues, is that economic growth might be somewhat curbed by reduced migration: Three economists writing for the American Enterprise Institute have estimated that net U.S. migration might be negative this year — for the first time in history — by more than 200,000. Most economists think the question is not whether but how much this will subtract from economic growth. Will was referring to a report from a business-backed advocacy center, which concluded that “We find that the large drop in net migration in 2025 compared with 2024 will result in significantly slower labor force growth, slower employment growth, and a decrease in GDP growth of around 0.3–0.4 percentage points.” Mass migration is good for the stock market, but less migration is better for per-capita wealth, according to an investor-funded study described by Breitbart News in October. “At medium and low immigration levels, labor-based [skilled professional] immigration, characterized by fewer but more skilled population, produces higher GDP [Gross Domestic Product] per capita [emphasis added] growth,” compared to mass inflow of migrants and their extended families, says the September study published by Springer, titled “Demographic and Economic Implications of Alternative U.S. Immigration Policies.” “That should be a no-brainer because we know we could annex Mexico and our GDP would be enormously higher, but our per capita income would drop,” Rosemary Jenks, cofounder of the Immigration Accountability Project, told Breitbart News. “That’s just ‘Duh!’” The study is useful because “you have the advocates [for mass migration] themselves saying immigration is not a good deal for the average American,” Stephen Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News. “It may be good for Wall Street, it’s not good for Main Street, ” he added. The study matches reality in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, where the estimated quality of life is declining and productivity is stalling because elites are importing consumers, renters, and workers to grow the nation’s real-estate prices and stock values. In contrast, President Trump and his deputies are pushing for greater productivity and automation instead of the mass migration favored by Will, progressives, and investors. We’re going to need robots … to make our economy run because we do not have enough people,” Trump told Breitbart News in August, adding: We don’t have enough people to do it. So we have to get efficient … we’ll probably add to [the existing workforce] through robotically—it’s going to be robotically. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of Silicon Valley investors in May. He added: And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink added.

Changing Times Brewery, which was founded by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs, is expecting sales to double next year with total keg sales of about 10,000, the group has said. The €2 million brewery, based in Glasnevin along the banks of the Royal Canal, is celebrating one year in operation this week. The brewery said it expects to see further growth in demand for its products, and that the increased sales will be driven by rising customer demand for its beers, expansion of the number of venues stocking their products and a further widening of their product range. A new product, called Bleedin Red Ale, becomes the fourth draft product offered by the brewery. Changing Times believes it will sell 3,000 kegs of Bleedin Red Ale by the end of 2027. A fifth beer is expected to be introduced in the first half of 2026. Changing Times products are now available in 33 venues across the country, up from the initial 15 pubs which stocked its products. The new venues include The Storyteller Pub on Grand Canal Street, Bill Ahernes on Aston Quay, The Oval on Abbey Street, Lock 13 in Sallins, Thomas Connollys in Sligo as well as Paul Flannerys, Jerry Flannerys, Patsy Flannerys and Phil Flannerys all in Limerick. The brewery’s backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of The Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. [ Changing Times Brewery beers to be stocked in nine new premises as it moves outside DublinOpens in new window ] Other backers include the publican families behind venues such as Arthur Mayne’s in Donnybrook, The Bank on College Green, The Blackrock, The Bridge 1859, Devitt’s, Doheny and Nesbitt, The Ferryman, The Long Hall, McSorley’s and The Swan. Pat Rigney, owner of The Shed Distillery, which is home of Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin, is another backer of Changing Times Brewery and also the group’s chairman. David Chawke, chief executive of Changing Times and owner of The Bank Bar and Restaurant on College Green, said: “We expect to see the number of keg sales double next year. “Practically since the day we launched we have had requests from customers for a red ale and thankfully we now are able to offer them a product we believe is as good as any other red ale on the market. “We see this product launch as another key marker for us. Adding a fourth product tap also further highlights the growing strength of our range on pub counters, creating more brand visibility for our brewery and for our existing strong line-up of beers. “It has been a really positive first year of operation for Changing Times and we are very happy with how everything has progressed. Launching a new brewery in this market was always going to be a risk, but we are very pleased with how our brewery has been received.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bringing in a new generation of hardware wallets: An interview with Adam Budínský

Most people don’t realize how deeply hardware wallets have influenced traditional industries. These devices proved a critical point: protecting digital identity, whether it’s a private key, a certificate of origin, or machine credentials, demands uncompromising hardware-based security. No shortcuts. No partial fixes. That idea of no compromise is key. For years, industries like industrial IoT, critical infrastructure, and manufacturing treated security as a checkbox. Think of PLCs controlling factory lines, smart meters on utility grids, or remote maintenance modules in power plants, threats seemed distant. Systems stayed offline. Security was someone else’s problem. But the landscape has shifted. Today, attacks are accelerating not just in volume, but in sophistication. And while attackers level up, the cost of launching an attack drops. This isn’t theory. It’s exactly what Trezor experienced when dealing with closed secure elements, and why Tropic Square was founded: to expose and address the hidden risks in hardware. The core issue is trust, or the lack of it. Can you trust the devices you operate? The machines that manufacture your products? In many cases, the answer is no. Most embedded systems weren’t built with serious security in mind. And that’s a problem, because low-assurance hardware is easy to hijack and repurpose by attackers. Now we’re seeing a shift: the same principles that drove the evolution of hardware wallets are being applied to industrial systems. Devices that look like wallets are appearing in factories and field deployments, anchoring machine identity, securing communication, and enforcing hardware-level trust. In an interview with Adam Budínský, Head of Hardware Product at Trezor, we discussed the technical challenges the team aimed to solve, and how the device reflects broader shifts in usability, transparency, and long-term crypto security. The crypto market is clearly maturing. We’re witnessing a major shift toward institutional adoption — from the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to large asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity adding significant crypto exposure to their portfolios. Global Bitcoin ETF assets under management have already surpassed $170 billion in 2025, which shows how mainstream digital assets are becoming. At the same time, retail participation hasn’t returned to the levels we saw in previous bull markets. Institutional flows are now shaping the market more than retail sentiment, and that’s one reason why we haven’t experienced the same kind of retail-driven frenzy this cycle. Many newcomers prefer the simpler path of owning crypto through ETFs or custodial platforms instead of holding it themselves. But that convenience comes at a cost. The fundamental truth still applies — “Not your keys, not your coins.” True ownership means self-custody, and hardware wallets remain the only secure and transparent way to actually control your digital assets. At Trezor, our mission is to make that level of security accessible and intuitive for everyone, so users can enjoy the same confidence and independence as institutions — without relying on third parties. Trezor Safe 7 was shaped by a clear signal from our users: they wanted a hardware wallet that delivers not just security, but also modern convenience and premium quality. As our lives have become increasingly wireless and intuitive, people have begun to expect the same from their self-custody tools. This device brings those expectations to life — with secure Bluetooth connectivity, wireless charging, a seamless aluminum unibody, and a larger high-res display. At the same time, it introduces the world’s first transparent secure element, TROPIC01, built specifically to bring verifiability into the heart of hardware security. Each decision was guided by user feedback — and by our belief that the safest wallet should also be the easiest to use. Everything in our digital lives has become seamless and wireless — and we believe self-custody should be no exception. For too long, hardware wallets have lagged behind the level of convenience, durability, and premium design we expect from modern devices. With Trezor Safe 7, we set out to close that gap. From its aluminum unibody to encrypted Bluetooth connectivity and wireless charging, every detail was designed to make secure self-custody feel intuitive and sophisticated. But that seamless experience rests on a rock-solid foundation. We pioneered a new security model: the world’s first transparent secure element working in tandem with a trusted industry-grade chip — offering users both verifiability and resilience. That commitment to innovation is reflected across the hardware, from the safer, long-lasting LiFePO₄ battery to the fully auditable Trezor Host Protocol. This is what the new standard for hardware wallets should look and feel like — not someday, but today. We focused on solving two key issues: convenience and the trade-off between usability and verifiable security. Many users felt that hardware wallets lacked modern ease of use. We addressed that by introducing Bluetooth connectivity, Qi2 wireless charging, a larger color touchscreen with haptic feedback, and a durable aluminum unibody. We also designed a long-lasting LiFePO4 battery — built to endure years of use and deep discharge — so users can trust their wallet to stay ready whenever they need it. These improvements make self-custody feel intuitive, reliable, and accessible for everyday use. At the same time, we tackled long-standing concerns around secure element transparency. Trezor Safe 7 is the first wallet to pair a fully auditable secure element (TROPIC01) with an industry-trusted chip. This dual architecture offers both physical resilience and cryptographic transparency — giving users security they can verify, not just trust.” Trezor Safe 7 reinforces what Trezor has always stood for: open-source, user-first security. But with this release, we’ve taken that commitment to a new level. By giving users a device that’s both transparent and elegant — built with verifiable components like the TROPIC01 chip and backed by years of trusted engineering — we’re showing that we listen, we evolve, and we lead. This device isn’t just an upgrade in specs; it’s a statement of our long-term promise to the community. Every design choice, from the secure Bluetooth protocol to the unibody aluminum shell, was made to deepen user confidence. We want people to feel proud to use Trezor — and to trust that we’ll always put their needs and safety first. The goal was to create a device that feels reassuring from the first moment — precise, robust, and thoughtfully engineered. Trezor Safe 7 is milled from a single block of aluminum, giving it a clean and durable form. The Gorilla Glass 3 screen adds both clarity and protection, supporting long-term daily use. It’s compact and lightweight, but built to handle the responsibility of securing your crypto. We wanted the physical design to reflect the same principles as our software: security, transparency, and simplicity. The future of wallets will be defined by a convergence of strong security principles with the usability standards of modern consumer technology. As digital assets become more embedded in daily life, users will expect wallets to offer the same level of simplicity, portability, and design sophistication as other smart devices — without sacrificing transparency or control. This means moving beyond purely utilitarian designs toward tools that are both secure and accessible to a broader audience. At Trezor, we believe that true security starts with open-source — especially at the hardware level. You can’t prepare for the future if your most critical component, the secure element, is closed and unverifiable. That’s why Tropic Square committed to developing open-source secure elements like TROPIC01. It allows independent experts to inspect and verify how the hardware protects private keys, ensuring real trust rather than blind faith. Equally important, every true hardware wallet must have a screen. It’s the only way for users to independently verify what they are signing. Any product that claims to be a hardware wallet without a display is simply giving users a false sense of security. The ability to see and confirm transaction details directly on the device — not on a potentially compromised computer or phone — is the foundation of secure self-custody. Ultimately, the wallets of the future won’t just protect coins — they’ll embody a philosophy of verifiable trust and transparency. Open hardware, open firmware, and open cryptography are the only sustainable path toward long-term, quantum-resistant security. Disclaimer: This article may be in collaboration with a valued partner.

Title: AI bubble about to pop as returns on investment fall short?

Billions have poured into AI, helping stock valuations soar. But the cracks are starting to show. Slowing adoption, surging costs and elusive profits are fueling warnings that the boom may be headed for a hard reset. The artificial intelligence (AI) party is still in full swing, with tens of billions globally pouring into infrastructure, startups and attracting the best talent. Among the headline announcements this year: ChatGPT parent company Open AI, Softbank and Oracle pledged to invest $500 billion (€433 billion) in AI supercomputers, Open AI and chip giant Nvidia announced a $100 billion fund to maintain the United States' dominance in advanced chips, while Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent hiked investments to help speed up China's ambition to lead AI by 2030. Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, driving around 75% of the S&P 500’s gains and propelling companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to record-breaking valuations. But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits. Many economists think usage concerns, barely three years into AI going mainstream, dropkick the prevailing narrative that AI would revolutionize how businesses operate by streamlining repetitive tasks and improving forecasting. "The vast bet on AI infrastructure assumes surging usage, yet multiple US surveys show adoption has actually declined since the summer," Carl-Benedikt Frey, professor of AI & work at the UK's University of Oxford, told DW. "Unless new, durable use cases emerge quickly, something will give — and the bubble could burst." The US Census Bureau, which surveys 1.2 million US companies every fortnight, found that AI-tool usage at firms with more than 250 employees dropped from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video AI’s biggest challenge remains its tendency to hallucinate — generating plausible but false information. Other weaknesses are inconsistent reliability and the poor performance of autonomous agents, which complete tasks successfully only about a third of the time. "Unlike an intern who learns on the job, today’s pretrained [AI] systems don’t improve through experience. We need continual learning and models that adapt to changing circumstances," said Frey. As the gap widens between sky-high expectations and commercial reality, investor enthusiasm for AI is starting to fade. In the third quarter of the year, venture-capital deals with private AI firms dropped by 22% quarter on quarter to 1,295, although funding levels remained above $45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, market intelligence firm CB Insights wrote last month. "What perturbs me is the scale of the money being invested compared to the amount of revenue flowing from AI," economist Stuart Mills, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told DW. Market leader OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, versus total operating expenses of $8-9 billion. The company says it is on course to make $13 billion this year but is still expected to burn through $129 billion before 2029, news site The Information calculated in September. Mills thinks generative AI companies like Elon Musk's Grok and ChatGPT are "charging far less than they need to make a profit" and should raise subscription prices. Few have quantified the AI bubble more starkly than Julien Garran, partner at UK-based research firm MacroStrategy Partnership. He argues that the sheer volume of capital flowing into AI — despite little evidence of sustainable returns — dwarfs previous speculative frenzies. "We estimate a misallocation of capital equivalent to 65% of US GDP — four times bigger than the housing buildup before the 2008/9 financial crisis and 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust," Garran told DW. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Recent earnings from Big Tech have sparked cautious optimism, but also fresh doubts about AI’s staying power. Data analytics and intelligence platform Palantir's Q3 revenue surged 63% year-over-year, but its stock price fell by up to 7% on the news. AMD and Meta also saw their strong AI-related earnings overshadowed by market concerns about sustainability. That disconnect between soaring valuations and shaky fundamentals is exactly what worries Mills, who sees a widening gap between what AI promises and what it actually delivers to businesses. "The data suggests that AI is not penetrating high enough up the value chain. Loads of people are using it, but it's not being used for tasks that directly contribute to value production," he told DW. Nvidia's upcoming earnings on November 19 may prove a key test of whether the AI boom still has legs. In the second quarter, Nvidia's data center sales alone made up 88% of total revenue, which hit a record $46.7 billion. For Q3, the company has guided $54 billion, projecting 54% year-on-year growth, which would equate to a full-year total of more than $200 billion. "With the exception of Nvidia, which is selling shovels in a gold rush, most generative AI companies are both wildly overvalued and wildly overhyped," Gary Marcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University, told DW. "My guess is that it will all fall apart, possibly soon. The fundamentals, technical and economic, make no sense." Garran, meanwhile, believes the era of rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) is drawing to a close, not because of technical limits, but because the economics no longer stack up. "They [AI platforms] have already hit the wall," Garran said, adding that the cost of training new models is "skyrocketing, and the improvements aren’t much better." Striking a more positive tone, Sarah Hoffman, director of AI Thought Leadership at the New York-based market intelligence firm AlphaSense, predicted a "market correction" in AI, rather than a "cataclysmic 'bubble bursting.'" After an extended period of extraordinary hype, enterprise investment in AI will become far more discerning, Hoffmann told DW in an emailed statement, with the focus "shifting from big promises to clear proof of impact." "More companies will begin formally tracking AI ROI [return on investment] to ensure projects deliver measurable returns," she added. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

The network is fast becoming the home of real-world finance. PayPal’s PYUSD hit $18.6B in transfer volume and tokenized fund AUM jumped 2,000%. ETH remains range-bound below $3,500, with weak momentum and neutral derivatives data. Ethereum’s [ETH] on-chain economy is entering a new phase. PayPal’s stablecoin volume keeps climbing, and major financial institutions are now moving real funds on-chain. Tokenization isn’t just an idea anymore. It’s quickly becoming one of Ethereum’s strongest growth engines. PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, hit its strongest quarter yet: $18.6 billion in transfer volume on Ethereum. This is a massive 260% jump year-over-year. The chart showed a steady climb across every quarter since early 2024, showing growing usage among both retail and institutional users. Source: X What’s driving this surge is simple: PayPal’s integration with onchain payments is turning PYUSD into one of Ethereum’s most active stablecoins. Tokenized funds on Ethereum have exploded, up nearly 2,000% since January 2024. The chart showed a clear inflection point earlier this year, driven by traditional giants like BlackRock and Fidelity launching on-chain versions of their funds. Source: X What started as a niche experiment in tokenized treasuries has turned into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. Simply put, the world’s biggest asset managers are validating Ethereum as the base layer for real-world finance. Ethereum was struggling to regain strength above the $3,500 mark at press time. The chart showed price action consolidating below the 9-day EMA, so short-term momentum was muted. RSI was at 37.7, indicating weak buying pressure, while the CMF at -0.10 indicates capital outflows from the market. Source: TradingView Trading volumes were subdued, which proves a lack of conviction among bulls. Source: Coinalyze Derivatives data support this caution. ETH’s Open Interest (OI) has slipped to around $17.6 billion, while Funding Rates remain near neutral at 0.0098%. ETH is seeing low leveraged activity. With volumes thinning and sentiment cooling, ETH remains range-bound unless a decisive breakout above $3,500 restores bullish conviction.

Title: AI factories face a long payback period but trillions in upside

UPDATED 22:49 EST / NOVEMBER 09 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante, David Floyer, Jackie McGuire, Scott Hebner and Christophe Bertrand Our latest forecast indicates that it will take a decade or more for artificial intelligence factory operators and model builders to reach breakeven on their massive capital outlays. Our projections call for nearly $4 trillion in cumulative capital spending outlays by 2030, with just under $2 trillion in cumulative AI revenue generated in that timeframe. We have the crossover point occurring early next decade (2032 on a run-rate basis) then gains far surpassing initial investments by the middle part of the 2030s. Though such projections are invariably subject to constant revision, we believe the size and speed of the initial investments, combined with the challenges of profitably monetizing AI at scale, will require patient capital and long-term thinking to realize durable business results. A short time after we published our first AI factories revenue outlook, OpenAI Group PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella introduced new data on the BG2 Pod. As well, on Nov. 4, The Information published projections from Anthropic in an article that also included financial projections on OpenAI based on multiple unnamed sources. This fresh information gives us an opportunity to revisit our figures and do so in the context of economist Erik Brynjolfsson’s productivity J-curve, which explains why new general purpose technologies, like electricity, the steam engine, computing and AI, often experience limited productivity growth at first, because organizations must learn, adapt and reorganize in order to realize benefits. Over time, these innovations tend to outperform expectations. Importantly, our forecasts focus on the business case for AI factory operators currently funding the massive AI buildout – specifically, the big CapEx spenders, including hyperscalers, neoclouds and AI research labs building today’s large language models. We do not attempt in this exercise to go down the “rabbit hole” of forecasting the investment and productivity output from enterprises consuming AI services. These are, however, related as the pace of both consumer and enterprise AI adoptiion will ultimately fuel monetization that AI factory operators will realize. In this Breaking analysis, we analyze these new data points and debate the shape of the AI factories economic curve. We’ll briefly introduce the productivity J-curve, share snippets from the Sam and Satya statements that in many ways speak to the AI productivity paradox. We’ll then revisit our AI factories forecast and assumptions; discuss some of the headwinds the industry must overcome to reach our projections and close with a vision of the future of AI and service as software. The productivity J-curve is a phenomenon where traditional measures of productivity growth initially dip before rising after the adoption of a new general-purpose technology or GPT. This occurs because a novel technology, such as AI, requires significant, but hard-to-measure, intangible investments in areas like employee training and business process redesign. These initial investments can cause temporary negative productivity impacts, but once organizations learn to productively apply the technology, full benefits are realized and productivity growth appears, often in quite dramatic fashion. The concept of the productivity J-curve was developed and modeled by the economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock and Chad Syverson. Recently, on theCUBE at UiPath Fusion, we asked Erik Brynjolfsson to explain the productivity J-curve in the context of today’s AI boom: [Watch Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson describe the productivity J-curve and how it relates to AI] Back when I was a young student in Boston, where I guess, I think we first met over there, I was working with Bob Solow, the Nobel Prize winner, and he pointed out that the computer age was everywhere, except the productivity statistics. So he asked me to look into this, and one of the things we saw was that all these companies were investing in these really amazing technologies, but nothing very valuable was coming out. And then later, as we know, in 1995, things started really taking off. And so I did some research, and the same pattern happened with lots of earlier technologies. With electricity, it was like 30 years, in fact, before you had a big boom. The steam engine. And so when I analyzed it, what we see is that these cool technologies, to really get the benefit of them, you have to rethink your business processes. You have to invest in human capital training, and so forth, and all that takes time and energy. And while you’re doing that, there’s not a lot of new output. So you’ve got more input, not a lot of output. By definition, that’s lower productivity. But then once you figure that out, things really take off. So to me, it kind of looks like a J, and we plot it. We did a paper in the American Economic Journal about that, to kind of work out the math of it. And now we’re seeing, I think, the same thing with AI. In our view, the productivity J-curve, at least in part, explains today’s AI return-on-investment paradox. Early adoption of general-purpose technologies is messy, utilization is uneven, workflows and data aren’t ready, and traditional measures of productivity often show dips before durable gains appear in the macro. The latest MIT and recent Enterprise Technology Research data points suggest only modest near-term ROI impact – single digits to low teens of enterprises seeing sustained ROI at scale. We’ve often said that agentic AI will take most of a decade to mature and permeate enterprises broadly. If we count inputs as AI CapEx and outputs as AI factory revenue, current productivity is negative, which helps explain market jitters and bubble talk. We believe near-term skepticism is unsurprising and the payoff depends on raising utilization, improving data quality and putting governed and secure agents into operation so that spend translates to tokens, and token production converts to revenue. Industry consensus had OpenAI revenues at about $13 billion. In a conversation with Altman, Brad Gerstner asked the obvious question: “How can a company with $13 billion in revenue make $1.4 trillion in spend commitments?” This raised Altman’s ire to the point where he spilled some revenue estimates that hadn’t been previously shared. [Watch Altman bristle at the criticisms] Specifically Altman said: Our further research indicates that both of these estimates are run-rate revenue projections. As such, we put OpenAI 2025 revenue at $15 billion. Moreover, in the clip above, Nadella lends credibility to Altman’s statements by claiming he’s never seen a business plan from OpenAI that the company hasn’t met or exceeded. Jackie McGuire of theCUBE Research had the following takeaways on Altman’s and Nadella’s comments: I think their tone tells you a lot about the message. To me, Sam actually sounded a little bit defensive in the “We’re doing well more than 13 billion.” It sounded to me like on one side that we’re doing way better than that. And on the other side, “I’m telling you guys, this is a sure bet. Take the Dodgers in the World Series. I’ve never seen them not lose a game.” There was an article last week in Wired that was called AI is the Bubble to Burst Them All. And it was talking about what the different things are that characterize a bubble, how people talk about it as one of them. And yeah, I don’t know. I just found the tone to be very more defensive than I would expect for somebody that feels really, really secure in the amount of revenue they’re doing. This narrative, as the Wired article reminds us, echoes the hype around RCA in the 1920s. Andrew Ross Sorkin in promoting his new book, “1929,” makes similar comparisons, with OpenAI as today’s analog. But it has faster execution, a bigger installed base and a much more mature communications infrastructure in its favor. Pulling OpenAI’s revenue projections forward suggests a meaningfully higher trajectory for the company. Nadella’s commentary frames OpenAI as an “execution machine” and is encouraging. Coupled with about 800 million monthly active users and what the company claims is 1 million enterprise API customers, demonstrates a blistering cadence and a glimpse of what the next great software company may look like. In the graphic below, we update our earlier AI factory forecast which reframes the datacenter buildout at an accelerated pace. The relevance is this represents the CapEx that ultimately foots the AI bill. Datacenter investments require land, power, water, distribution, thermal systems, and the accelerated stack itself – compute, storage and networking. The AI piece of the forecast (dark brown bars) is astounding and forcing a stack flip to extreme parallelism. The following key additional points are notable: The pace of the buildout steepens relative to our April forecast reflecting disclosures from recent earnings prints and deal signings that indicate OpenAI has secured a disproportionate share of advanced package/graphics processing unit capacity, while Google LLC has stepped up commitments, along with other hyperscalers and Meta Platforms Inc. Taken together, these inputs justify pulling forward AI-factory outlays. As we’ll show below, revenue ramp lags in the model when assessing cumulative spend vs. cumulative revenue. The most recent forecast implies that although hyperscalers, neoclouds and specialist providers will operate much of the capacity, enterprises will ultimately need to underwrite a majority of the economics over time via consumption. This will happen extensively through cloud, neoclouds and colo channels as well as selective on-premises deployments, especially as edge AI matures. While Wall Street rightly notes the hyperscaler and neocloud GPU estates are “lit up,” enterprises running clusters of 1,000-plus GPUs often sit below 30% utilization because of thin parallel-computing muscle memory, immature workflows and data friction. That underutilization is stressed by rapid hardware depreciation; unlike dark fiber in 2000, GPUs lose value fast. In our view, if enterprises cannot translate capacity to tokens and productivity, ROI will accrue elsewhere in the value chain until operating discipline catches up. Endpoints are a potential tailwind as an AI PC refresh cycle will push more inference to the edge, and a return to pragmatic hybrid is likely as organizations balance economics, latency, privacy and the practical limits of data movement. The operational reality is we live in a 12- to 18-month replacement cycle with e-waste and labor challenges implying a perpetual “paint-the-Golden-Gate-Bridge” refresh cadence applied to rows and racks of infrastructure. Hybrid AI will also be deployed by enterprises. As such, choice and flexibility across on-prem/colo/public will matter and upgrade timelines will vary, which argues for architectures that let teams “tap the public” while local capacity evolves (the labor and talent constraints are visible in the workforce data we present later). Data gravity and storage economics are also at play. We expects a meaningful share of cost to sit in storage and data management, not just GPUs. We will likely see renewed interest in deep, economical tiers (including tape) and a storage-vendor arms race to live closer to the accelerators, because data readiness, lineage and metadata for agentic workflows are gating factors to scale. The net is the spend is real and earlier, but breakeven will stretch beyond a decade with improvements in utilization, fabric efficiency and governed data pipelines taking time. In our opinion, the operating agenda is raise money, do deals, build fast, secure power and GPUs, increase utilization, compress network latency, harden governed data planes and sequence hybrid capacity so depreciation curves don’t outrun value realization. The data below represents revenue output from AI factory operators. It does not represent the value created by mainstream enterprises driving productivity and contributing to the macro gross domestic product uplift. Forecasting that impact is a separate exercise that requires assumptions about firm level productivity impacts. Rather this forecast is meant to help us model the revenue return on the massive CapEx buildup happening with AI, which will power a massive productivity boom in our view. The following five key messages are conveyed in the data: Our updated revenue forecast reflects a steeper commercialization curve for AI factories, with OpenAI’s trajectory set higher based on the new information. The near-term ~$20 billion run rate this year and a path to ~$100 billion by 2027, is based on growth initially fueled by consumer/prosumer demand and then accelerated by a rapid cadence of APIs and software that connect to enterprise data. We group Google and Anthropic as a combined partnership because TPU capacity and tight technical alignment make joint scaling plausible even as each maintains distinct channels; and Anthropic has a close partnership with AWS. We assume China’s block rises on restricted access to U.S. technology, which concentrates domestic investment and demand. A core debate from theCUBE Research team is whether a vertically integrated, more “closed” approach can sustain leadership versus an “open grid” that standardizes inter-factory integration. On one side, we argue that without open standards and protocols, multicompany business-to-business workflows risk fragmenting into a patchwork of proprietary adapters, repeating early cloud pain and slowing the “intelligence economy.” Trust requirements (transparency, accountability) and the cost of data movement and governance reinforce the case for openness; unified enterprise data will be the gating factor and creates room for data mobility vendors to grab a piece of the market. On the other side, we note that de facto standards have repeatedly led markets – IBM/360, Windows on commodity PCs, AWS primitives, iPhone, CUDA and the like – where proprietary control plus ecosystem gravity created the interoperability that matter in practice. In that view, surviving factories will define interfaces bilaterally and at scale, then formal standards follow. Key assumption: Enterprises will mostly consume AI via APIs; interoperability will improve through a mix of de facto interfaces and selective open standards; unified, governed data is the real prerequisite to value capture. Netting it out, the forecast supports OpenAI as the current favorite in the race. Advantaged by funding, compute access, fast software/API velocity and deep partnerships, we see this compounding into share gains even if the posture is more closed than purists would like. We acknowledge the risk that openness wins the long game; however, history suggests that de facto standards often dominate first, with formal openness catching up later. Our base case therefore keeps OpenAI in the lead, while watching for evidence of durable open protocols that would shift share toward more open operators. The chart below shows our cumulative CapEx forecast required to build AI factories (orange line) and the token revenue from those factories green line. As you can see, this business is not for the faint of heart, as described by the points below. We believe the cumulative-spend vs. cumulative-revenue forecast underscores the AI productivity paradox in that a multitrillion-dollar CapEx wave begins in 2024, but revenue trails for a decade-plus, yielding an early J-curve where measured productivity looks low or even negative. The spend line reflects the full factory build – land, power, water, distribution, thermal and accelerated stacks – while the revenue line captures commercialization that starts slowly and steepens only after end-to-end solutions mature. In our analysis, three inhibitors dominate the early years: 1) Weak data quality – web data is noisy and enterprise data is also challenging – requiring time-consuming cleanup, harmonization and policy controls; 2) The need for the industry to package and ship a unified, trustworthy agentic software layer that enterprises can adopt without bespoke integration; and 3) The sheer denominator problem – so much CapEx goes out up front that catching up takes time even as utilization improves. There is broad agreement that value creation ultimately skyrockets as the operating leverage kicks in; the open question is pace. Some argue the crossover could come sooner for targeted, high-value workflows rather than blanket enterprise adoption, while others maintain that the scale of CapEx alone pushes breakeven out ~11 years. Headwinds we see: Land/power/water constraints; skilled labor and operational cadence; poor/fragmented data and governance; evolving regulations (and geopolitical frictions) that complicate data movement; and the learning curve to stand up agentic control planes. Netting it out, the forecast dovetails with our key takeaways – a large near-term gap, a long breakeven, early J-curve headwinds, heavy physical/operational constraints and a path to compress the gap by securing energy, lifting utilization, tightening fabrics and hardening governed data pipelines. We believe Deloitte’s “Can US infrastructure keep up with the AI economy?” report articulates a central constraint to our thesis: Energy and water availability – and the speed of grid expansion – will set the pace of the buildout. AI racks run hotter and denser than legacy estates, pushing a structural shift from evaporative to liquid/mechanical cooling and forcing operators to site facilities where dual utility feeds are feasible for redundancy. That is driving builds toward inland markets with favorable land and interconnects but limited local talent pools, while creating visible, localized electricity price inflation in the two to three years following large deployments. In the near term, backup generation remains largely diesel and the grid mix still leans on fossil sources; corporate power purchase agreements and new renewables help, but lead times are long. Nuclear is re-entering the conversation as one of the few scalable, round-the-clock options capable of matching multigigawatt AI clusters over the decade. In our view, this energy reality dovetails with the J-curve economics in that even if capital is available, the tempo of power procurement, water rights and cooling retrofits slows time-to-tokens and represents a headwind to revenue realization. The practical takeaway is that breakeven moves with infrastructure, not just silicon. Implications: Operators will prioritize sites with dual-feed capacity and water sources; lock long-dated PPAs while exploring nuclear options; expect localized utility rate pressure; plan for liquid cooling skills and supply chains; treat energy procurement as a first-class program office alongside networking and data governance. The Deloitte study lays out many challenges and solutions to building out AI infrastructure. Perhaps one that is most underappreciated is skilled labor. We believe a key blocker after power is people. Deloitte’s survey shows competition for skilled labor and a shortage of data-center-specific skills as the top workforce challenges. Building and operating AI factories requires niche trades – nuclear engineers, diesel-gen technicians, high-capacity chiller mechanics and specialized welders – not generic information technology staff. These workers are scarce, unevenly distributed and often unwilling to relocate to inland locations where dual-feed power and water are available, pressuring wage inflation and scheduling risk. The data underscores the point in that respondents cite competition with other sectors (~53%), a shortage of data-center–related skilled labor (~51%), geographic limits on talent (~43%), and high turnover (~42%) as primary obstacles. Labor regulation adds friction as well; notably, power-company executives flag regulation as a challenge far more often than data-center builders, reflecting state-by-state and EU-style variability. Against that backdrop, hyperscalers, neoclouds and well-funded operators will pay up for the best people, while governments are also in the hunt – tightening the market further. In our view, solving the talent gap requires a multiyear effort – national and regional programs to retrain displaced workers; vocational pipelines starting in high school for advanced welding, mechanical and electrical trades, fluid engineers that understand advanced plumbing; and increased use of robotics to service multibuilding campuses measured in football fields. Without this workforce ramp, the CapEx-revenue crossover slips, regardless of how fast silicon ships. Satya Nadella made the following statement: So the new SaaS applications, as you rightfully said, are intelligent applications that are optimized for a set of evals and a set of outcomes that then know how to use the token factories output most efficiently. Sometimes latency matters, sometimes performance matters. And knowing how to do that trade in a smart way is where the SaaS application value is. But overall, it is going to be true that there is a real marginal cost to software this time around. It was there in the cloud era too. When we were doing CD-ROMs, there wasn’t much of a marginal cost. With the cloud, there was. And this time around, it’s a lot more. And so therefore, the business models have to adjust and you have to do these optimizations for the agent factory and the token factory separately. AI is shifting the margin math again. The CD-ROM era drove marginal cost toward the price of plastic; SaaS reintroduced a cloud OpEx tax; AI adds the heaviest burden yet – rapidly depreciating GPUs, power and specialized labor – so headline gross margins compress even as volume potential explodes. Those dynamics align with recent comments about marginal cost pressure and sets the stage for what we view as the more important transition – George Gilbert’s service-as-software or SaSo thesis. In SaSo, factories expose agentic capabilities as programmable services, enterprises consume them through APIs and lightweight local runtimes, and the “software-like” economics accrue disproportionately to buyers (productivity) and to a handful of sellers that achieve scale, utilization, and distribution. We see three forces accelerating SaSo despite near-term cost gravity. First, algorithmic and systems efficiency will complement brute-force scaling – better data selection, sparsity, compilation, and workload shaping can cut compute costs materially. Second, distributed AI will split work sensibly: pre- and post-processing at the edge (including on devices) with factory inference and training behind APIs; storage tiers (including tape) and robotics will lower the cost of operating massive campuses. Third, the factories with the deepest ecosystems will ship the systems of intelligence or SoI agentic control planes, software development kits and adapters that enterprises adopt “as-is,” rather than building bespoke stacks. In our view, this means most organizations will prioritize owning and governing their data while sourcing intelligence from a few high-volume factories that improve fastest. Bottom line: The AI factory buildout is real, front-loaded, and subject to a decade-long J-curve. Power, talent and data quality/governance pace the crossover point. Revenue capture accrues to operators that 1) Drive utilization, 2) Win the networking and systems efficiency game, 3) Support the delivery of trustworthy agentic platforms as services, 4) mobilize developer ecosystems, and 5) Relentlessly work the supply chain. Buyers of AI will see software-like marginal economics. That sets up a a winner-takes-most market.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St Shares of NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) dropped 7.1% this week, sinking sharply after hitting a high of $211.34 on Monday morning. Yet, even with the losses, NVIDIA shares had quickly plummeted into correction territory midday Friday. Shares sank to a low of $178.91 before rebounding to close the day at $188.15, a slight gain from Thursday’s close. So, the big question facing NVIDIA investors is whether last week’s losses were the result of ‘market noise’ or were a signal of something larger and more troubling. Let’s dive into 3 catalysts that led to this week’s sell-off. The Nasdaq Composite fell more than 3% last week. Tech stocks in particular were under pressure with the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) down 4.2% NVIDIA may have fallen 7.1%, but other semiconductor stocks also fell. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) fell 5.5% while AMD (Nasdaq: AMD) plunged 8.8%. The biggest news among this group of companies at the forefront of producing AI accelerators was AMD’s earnings. Overall, the earnings were a positive piece of news for the industry. AMD forecast outlook of $9.6 billion next quarter, far ahead of Wall Street estimates of about $9.2 billion. Looking further out, AMD projects ‘tens of billions’ in revenue from their data center business from 2027. If you’re an ‘AI bull’ who believes the cycle is far from slowing down, AMD’s earnings generally supported that idea. If you’re looking for reasons the broader market took a nose dive this week, it appeared to be a broader ‘risk-off.’ Most days, technology stocks fell, more defensive industries like Financials, Healthcare, and Consumer Staples rose. Macroeconomic headlines like consumer confidence plummeting amidst the continuing government shutdown also rattled markets. Another key reason technology stocks fell this week was OpenAI ‘spooking’ the market. Earlier in the week, comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman were widely shared across both social media and within money management circles. In the video (embedded in the X post below), you can see Altman get very defensive about a very reasonable question about the company’s ability to finance aggressive spending plans from venture capitalist Brad Gerstner. Apparently, if you ask @sama how his $13 billion money-losing for profit not-for-profit can support $1.4 TRILLION of spend commitments, he gets very defensive and starts to attack non-existent short sellers.I cannot wait for @OpenAI to be a public company. pic.twitter.com/DTPVJJf86x Another key OpenAI storyline was the Wall Street Journal reporting the company was seeking a government backstop on its data center investments. The comments were made by CFO Sarah Friar in an interview with the paper, and OpenAI tried walking them back as ‘poor wording.’ Yet the damage was done. Investors are quickly reversing course and viewing OpenAI as less of a catalyst in the AI space and more of a risk. The company has been on a barnstorming PR tour for more than a month, announcing major deal after major deal and the longer the PR tour goes, the more ‘bubble talk’ grows. There were other headlines this week that captured the media’s attention, such as Jensen Huang stating ‘China is going to win the AI race’ (another statement that has been walked back). But beyond all the noise, the bottom line for NVIDIA investors is that the actual earnings news was very positive last week. Earlier, we detailed how AMD’s guidance for next quarter was very positive and the company also forecast massive scale into 2027. Another bright spot was optics companies. Lumentum, Fabrinet, and Coherent all forecast extremely strong sales. That’s an important indicator for other AI infrastructure companies, as a surge in optics is just one more datapoint in a major acceleration in data center builds. Overall, NVIDIA saw a big decline this week, but the actual news flow around the company was fairly positive this week, thanks to earnings. Their losses are mostly attributable to investors selling off risk this week and comments from OpenAI leading to added selling pressure on AI stocks.

Title: AI’s Bright Line Bottlenecks: 3 Stocks Poised to Break Through to Massive Growth

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly, but it faces significant constraints in power availability and physical space for data centers. While there are abundant graphics processing units (GPUs) available from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the real bottleneck lies in securing affordable, reliable energy to power them and the infrastructure to house them efficiently. This creates opportunities for companies that specialize in converting low-cost power into high-utilization compute resources for AI workloads. Three stocks stand out for their ability to address these issues: Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS), IREN (NASDAQ:IREN), and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR). By focusing on efficient data centers, vertical integration, and leased infrastructure, these firms position themselves as key enablers in the AI ecosystem, potentially driving growth as demand for compute surges. Nebius Group leads as a comprehensive AI utility provider, emphasizing pre-sold capacity that generates revenue before construction even starts. This approach minimizes risks and ensures steady cash flow, as its recent five-year, $17 billion deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) underscores, as it locks in multi-year contracts. The company’s data centers operate about 20% more power-efficiently than standard cloud facilities, reducing operational costs where energy can account for over 40% of expenses. This efficiency allows Nebius to undercut competitors like Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS or even Microsoft’s Azure while preserving higher margins. What sets Nebius apart is its software integration, offering tools like ClickHouse for data management and MLOps pipelines alongside compute resources. This creates a sticky platform where developers face high switching costs once deployed. The result is a synergistic model: affordable energy, optimized hardware, and embedded software tools reinforce one another, blending energy-like stability with software growth potential. As AI demands escalate, Nebius’s full-stack strategy could capture a larger share of the market by delivering reliable, scalable compute that keeps facilities running at peak capacity. IREN excels by controlling the entire chain from power generation to AI compute delivery, making it one of the most integrated players in the space. With renewable energy costs averaging around $0.035 cents per kilowatt-hour — among North America’s lowest — IREN owns the land, substations, and cooling systems needed for rapid expansion. This ownership enables quick deployment of GPU clusters, with thousands already operational and plans for tens of thousands more in Canada and Texas. The company’s edge comes from eliminating intermediary costs, achieving gross margins over 70% on GPU compute rentals. Management targets 60,000 GPUs by 2026, potentially generating $2.5 billion in cloud revenue as utilization ramps up. Microsoft clearly sees the benefit of farming out the operations and just agreed to a massive $10 billion deal with IREN to provide it with high-performance GPU cloud computing. By owning the power and infrastructure outright, IREN avoids splitting profits with vendors, turning cheap energy into a direct competitive advantage. In an era where space and power limit AI growth, IREN’s model accelerates the conversion of underutilized resources into fully operational compute, helping bridge the gap between abundant GPUs and insufficient energized capacity. Cipher Mining functions as a strategic landlord in the AI buildout, providing powered space to major tenants through long-term leases. Its Barber Lake campus, built for high-density operations and gigawatt-scale expansion, has secured a multi-billion-dollar, decade-long agreement with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), ensuring stable revenue and low counterparty risk. It also just signed another major pact with Amazon to support AI workloads over a 15-year lease agreement, valued at around $5.5 billion. This fixed-rent model offers predictability, though it caps upside from fluctuating GPU prices. Unlike Nebius or IREN, Cipher focuses on the physical layer — land, power, and facilities — without owning the compute hardware. Growth relies on capital raises to develop new sites, resembling an industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) with consistent cash flows. In a market tight on capacity, this positions Cipher well, but it may shift to a more defensive stance as supply increases. Still, by renting out ready-to-use space, Cipher directly tackles AI’s space constraints, enabling hyperscalers to deploy GPUs without the delays of building from scratch.

UPDATED 13:05 EST / NOVEMBER 09 2025 by Victoria Gayton The modernization mandate is clear: Enterprise IT can no longer wait. Disruptive workloads and brittle legacy systems are forcing companies to act fast, with many now searching for tools that can support a next-generation AI architecture and redefine the data center. The nearly 20-year alliance between Dell Technologies Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has become a key architectural answer to this shift. Once foundational, the partnership now centers on next-generation AI architecture and private cloud strategy — areas where modernization is no longer optional. The stakes are binary, according to Juan Martinez (pictured), senior director of OEM/ODM enterprise and HPC at AMD. TheCUBE Research’s Rob Strechay talks about the Dell and AMD partnership during the “5 Steps to a Smarter Private Cloud” event. “Our customers, regardless of the industry … are facing two potential outcomes,” Martinez told theCUBE. “One outcome is [to] be a disruptor in their industry, which will be great for them, or be disrupted by someone else.” Dell and AMD’s shared focus on efficiency and cost resonates with enterprise buyers. Their integrated approach offers a stable alternative to unpredictable public cloud expenses and tackles core pain points, according to Rob Strechay, principal analyst at theCUBE. “I think that one of the things that’s really interesting is … that not only helps from a density perspective, power and cooling, but also licensing costs when you’re looking at software that are licensed that way,” Strechay said during the recent “5 Steps to a Smarter Private Cloud” event. “We see it from the … organizations we talk to on a daily basis.” This feature is part of SiliconANGLE Media’s ongoing exploration into enterprise modernization and next-generation infrastructure ecosystems. (* Disclosure below.) While AI’s growing influence drives enterprise modernization, Dell and AMD’s real-world impact is already visible in the budget. Their joint solutions are delivering measurable cost relief to IT teams today. Dell’s broader approach to silicon optionality — offering customers a choice between AMD, Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. — allows organizations to match the right performance and price-per-watt profile to each unique workload, according to theCUBE’s Dave Vellante. AMD’s Juan Martinez talks with theCUBE about the AMD-Dell partnership. The joint engineering between Dell PowerEdge and AMD’s EPYC processor line is designed to tackle two major pressures: rising AI compute demands and the need to extend the value of existing infrastructure, thereby enabling the next-generation AI architecture, according to Martinez. The strategy is especially effective in virtualized environments, where maximizing server output is key to reducing overall infrastructure sprawl. “When we look into what we are offering between Dell PowerEdge and our AMD EPYC portfolio, basically we are getting that customers are able to run a larger number of virtual machines per server versus what they used to do in the past,” Martinez told theCUBE. “They are able to get up to 192 cores of performance, high memory bandwidth, and on top of that, we are able to bring a comprehensive path for migration.” This emphasis on efficiency isn’t just theory. Dell and AMD currently hold two world records for VMware performance per socket, highlighting their ability to drive greater density, smarter power management and stronger cost efficiency, according to Martinez. Early customer results back it up: Some have reduced hardware usage by as much as 90%, unlocking the budgetary freedom to focus more on innovation. “AMD EPYC is basically putting all the higher core count, the high memory bandwidth, and that is putting all the comprehensive path to manage all the transition in a way that is making sense from a technical standpoint and AMD standpoint,” Martinez said. “We’re working with Dell very actively to have co-engineering tools that help them to have a comprehensive path to maximize their private clouds and the solutions that they’re running in those private clouds.” As AI workloads become more varied and distributed, system designers are shifting away from monolithic architectures toward balanced, co-engineered infrastructure to support next-generation AI architecture. Dell and AMD’s collaborative approach to building PowerEdge systems with AMD’s Turin family tailors configurations to support AI deployments of all sizes — not just the largest hyperscale use cases, according to David Schmidt, senior director of PowerEdge product management at Dell, and Derek Dicker, corporate vice president, enterprise and HPC business groups at AMD. Dell’s Alyson Langon and Alison Briers talk with theCUBE about the Dell and AMD partnership. “When we sat down and first started discussing Turin with AMD, we recognized that there’s different sizes for different parts of customer journeys, what they need to deploy in their data center,” Schmidt told theCUBE. ”We looked at how AMD was laying out Turin, the Turin stack from top to bottom, and we really challenged each other on what we needed to provide. We were bringing system design ideas to the table of serving customers that need eight cores, 16 cores. It’s not all about the highest core counts possible; it’s about providing the right range.” As hardware density and core counts increase, the pressure on power and cooling infrastructure becomes a key design constraint. This demand is driving a shift back to on-premises control, with customers seeking to avoid high variable costs and gain predictable total cost of ownership, according to Alyson Langon, director of product marketing at Dell, and Alison Biers, global marketing senior director for server, networking and vertical industries at Dell. “[Customers] need predictable [total cost of ownership] so that they can have better budget control,” Briers told theCUBE. “They also want to avoid vendor lock-in with a modular, open infrastructure that can provide that ease of portability, as well as flexibility, and they really want to keep control of their data. They need to keep that data local and secure for stronger compliance and security … they need visibility to the future costs, and they want to … have that across their organization, whether it comes from departments within their organizations or from IT.” Dell’s updated AI Factory architecture is designed to meet enterprises where they are — whether starting small with device-level AI or scaling into full multi-rack deployments. With support for multiple accelerator vendors, the platform enables organizations to choose the right hardware configuration for their workloads without lock-in. This flexibility allows enterprises to evolve from early pilots to mature, production-scale AI faster and with lower risk, according to Adam Glick, senior director of AI portfolio marketing at Dell. Dell’s Adam Glick talks with theCUBE about the Dell AI Factory. “The AI transformation that we’re seeing is really a Cambrian explosion,” Glick told theCUBE. “You’re talking about the people who are on the forefront or not. You need to avoid being left behind because what you can do with AI is just amazing.” The platform’s modular design is backed by a rigorously tested stack of hardware, networking and software components, including Dell’s Application Catalog, support for Hugging Face Inc.’s open-weight models and optimized on-premises deployment workflows. For companies managing infrastructure complexity and resource constraints, Dell’s emphasis on validated, full-stack solutions — in collaboration with partners such as AMD and Red Hat Inc. — simplifies rollouts and accelerates time-to-value for the next-generation AI architecture. “There’s a lot of work that’s gone together to integrate these two pieces,” Glick said. “It’s not just the hardware pieces and the machines that go together, but it’s also the networking and the software stack, [which is] tested, integrated [and] optimized to be able to deploy that and deploy it fast and at scale to deliver solutions that our customers are looking for.” The operational reality of running an AI Factory hinges on addressing siloed, fragmented data, which Dell solves with its AI Data Platform. A critical feature of this platform is the architectural decoupling of data storage (leveraging Dell PowerScale and ObjectScale) from data processing engines, eliminating bottlenecks and providing the essential flexibility for advanced AI workloads such as retrieval-augmented generation and next-generation AI architecture. This modular, open-architecture approach empowers organizations to move from AI pilots to full production faster and with reduced risk, according to Travis Vigil, senior vice president of ISC product management at Dell. “With our Dell AI Data Platform, storage engines and data engines are each optimized for what they do best, working together, but independently,” Travis said during an interview with theCUBE. That means no bottlenecks, no lock-in — just the freedom to innovate on your terms. By separating data processing from storage, we eliminate friction and reduce solution costs.” Together, Dell and AMD are proving that modernization isn’t just about new technology — it’s about giving enterprises the architectural freedom to innovate at their own pace, according to Strechay.

Title: Southern California’s Main Street economy rattled by inflation, ICE raids and tariffs

Evidence of economic pain is rippling across Southern California, hitting businesses big and small. Until last month, Simon Yoon ran a popular sushi restaurant tucked away in a Diamond Bar strip center where commuters often stopped to pick up a bite to eat while waiting out the rush hour congestion at the nearby 57 and 60 freeway interchange. Yoon shuttered his restaurant, Fusion 2 Any 1, because he could no longer make ends meet due to a wave of policy decisions to remake the economy by President Donald Trump, who’s just under a year in office now. Yoon said he could no longer afford the $14,000 monthly rent and rising expenses caused by tariffs that tripled the price of everything from a box of chopsticks and a bag of garlic to plastic knives, forks and avocados. “I couldn’t raise my prices to the consumers,” said Yoon, who didn’t want to push away his regulars. “I cut lots of labor.” Also see: Economy shows ‘resilience’ despite ‘thorny issues,’ CSUF economists say He also blamed the drop-off in customers on raids and tactics used in recent weeks by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Diamond Bar, which created a climate of fear in the community. “It’s hurting a lot of business,” Yoon said. “Catching criminals is great, but not everyone is a criminal. There are a lot of hard-working people that are having their families broken up. That’s sad to see.” The 48-year-old Yoon voted for Trump a year ago but now regrets it. “I’m hoping for the best, but nobody comes out to eat,” he said. Yoon isn’t the only business owner barely making ends meet these days. Businesses across Southern California have shed thousands of workers amid a slowing economy, many citing similar reasons to Yoon’s — stretching from Anaheim to Ontario and Pasadena. On Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that last month was the worst October for layoff announcements since 2003. California saw 158,734 people laid off from Jan. 1-Oct. 31, up 16% over last year’s 136,661 — the second-largest employment cuts nationwide, according to the outplacement firm. Cuts in federal funding — fueled by the longest-running federal government shutdown, now at 40 days — also are having their effects. Tariff wars with foreign nations over imports have rattled local businesses, as some are struggling with inflation and labor issues. Cal State University Fullerton economists Anil Puri and Mira Farka and other economists with UCLA Anderson and Beacon Economics recently delivered cautionary forecasts on the state of the economy. Underscoring the concerns, the CSUF economists said that inflation is expected to likely continue to “edge higher into the first quarter of next year,” though they do not expect it to get out of hand, anticipating a peak of around 3.5%.” They added that inflation has “yet to crest,” and “the labor market has yet to find its floor — though neither is expected to inflict as much pain as once feared.” The current annual inflation rate for the U.S. was 3% for the year period ending in September. New inflation statistics published by the regional Consumer Price Indexes for September show an 3.5% inflation rate for Los Angeles and Orange counties. That’s the biggest cost-of-living bump in 16 months. The economists said they wouldn’t be surprised if the remainder of the year is marked by “a few more bumps, with payrolls weakening further as firms await clarity on trade deals, the government shutdown and overall consumer demand.” Layoffs in the region have picked up from a year ago, according to the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal agency that keeps track of jobs data. The BLS paused updates during the government’s shutdown that began Oct. 1. In August, the unemployment rate in Orange County stood at 4.6%, down from a revised 4.8% in July 2025, but above the year-ago estimate of 4.5%. Similar unemployment trends were reported in Los Angeles County (6.3% in August), Riverside County (6.1%) and San Bernardino County (6.1%). Puri and Farka said people should brace for sticker shock when the government reopens, revising figures on job losses and “alarming” hiring conditions. In the past month, Anaheim theme park Disneyland laid off 100 salaried employees as Orange County’s largest employer recalibrates its business ahead of the busy Christmas holiday season. Amazon also is cutting 760 jobs in Southern California — 333 in Irvine — beginning in January as part of a shakeup driven by artificial intelligence, and Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties laid off 81 people as it shutters Melody Health, its primary care practice, due to federal budget cuts. Other layoffs in October: Some companies even feel the time is ripe to sell. In August, Las Vegas-based Silver State HVAC, Refrigeration & Plumbing acquired The Whitman Co. in Anaheim. “We wanted to avoid a fire sale,” said Linda Whitman, manager of the business and married to owner Fred Whitman, who pointed to the rising cost of doing business in California and plans to retire while the going was good. She said profit margins were shrinking due to the rising prices of commercial-grade heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems since the pandemic when supplies tightened, plus challenges emerging in the past year with tariffs. “We sold primarily for retirement purposes, but it also was driven by what you’ve heard a million times. It’s getting impossible to run a business in California,” Whitman said. “It’s hard to sustain that when costs for workers’ compensation and liability insurance are going up 25% year-over-year, in addition to labor costs and everything else. “One of our big customers is a chain restaurant, and they have been struggling, and that of course affects us,” said Whitman, whose company has avoided layoffs by cutting back hours during certain times of the year. “If we weren’t going to be retiring, it would have been for all the other reasons that we might sell. Our sales have been increasing, but our profitability has not.” In Ontario, local shopkeepers are also worried about the economy. In May 2024, Javier Barajas and his wife, Tania Mangas, took over the Tortas Ahogadas Chapala restaurant in downtown Ontario along G Street. It’s located in a strip center across the street from the popular El Pescador Mexican restaurant along Euclid Avenue — which was packed on Tuesday with a lunchtime crowd of city probation officers and office workers. “People are scared,” said Barajas of the ICE raids. Also see: Inland Empire ICE detainees include gardeners, students, fathers Recent ICE operations in Ontario have dampened dining out and shopping. Business owners interviewed cited high-profile incidents like a landscaper being detained inside a surgical center in July, and a shooting during a vehicle stop in October. Other incidents include the taking into custody of at least three people at a Stater Bros. Markets along Holt Boulevard and arrests of gardeners. Tariffs have not treated Barajas very well, as the price for meats added to Mexican dishes have doubled. On Tuesday, there were a handful of customers eating at the restaurant — which he says was busier before the raids began in the community this past summer. For instance, he said, a chuck roll — a large boneless cut of beef from the shoulder of the cow — shot to $7.50 from $3.80 a pound last year, while a pound of ranchera meat — a higher premium type of beef cut, most commonly used in Mexican dishes like carne asada — jumped to $10.50 from $7 a pound. He says beef prices are up because tariffs have led to higher overhead costs for feed, fuel and labor that have contributed to higher prices consumers see at the grocery store and in their bills at restaurants — like at his. “It’s super hard to make money. I spend all of my money on the restaurant,” said Barajas, who has posted a “help wanted” sign on his restaurant’s front door to fill a cook opening. At the JROD Insurance Agency just south of El Pescador, owner Jesse Rodriguez said that his business is barely getting by. “We used to get walk-in business every time the Route 66 car show was held in Ontario. I didn’t get one customer this time,” said Rodriguez of the 12th annual Route 66 Cruisin’ Reunion that roared into downtown Ontario on Sept. 19. “There’s a slowdown everywhere here in town.” Andres Torres, co-owner of Mission Furniture along Euclid, said that he saw furniture sales climb in the early days of the pandemic when everyone was locked down in their homes and shopping online. Sales have since tapered off, and profits have narrowed in line with a slowing economy he saw before Trump’s election. But another slowdown has emerged with Trump administration-imposed tariffs on Vietnam and China, causing furniture prices to edge up 5-10%, Torres said. “It’s tough, but I’m looking to the future to get ahead of the curve,” said Torres of development projects for housing and more potential shoppers coming in Ontario’s downtown area. “Our intention is to survive this, but the ICE raids don’t help.” Diamond Bar’s Yoon might be temporarily down, but he’s come up with a survival plan for his business. He recently took an offer from a business colleague to open his restaurant in a section of the Gangnam Korean BBQ along Golden Springs Drive, across the street from the Diamond Bar Golf Course. If Yoon can turn his sushi-take out spot profitable, he may end up owning the new restaurant within Gangnam, and begin paying rent to its owner. For now, however, he’s content with managing the bar and restaurant in half the space of his old one a mile away. “I don’t want to leave at the bottom because I did so much for the community,” he said. “I want to go on for a few more years.”

Title: Why BlackRock remains bullish on Bitcoin despite recent price slowdown

BlackRock frames Bitcoin's adoption, liquidity depth, and legacy system decline as drivers of long-term strategic value. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s recent struggle to hold the $100,000 level has revived familiar doubts about whether institutional demand is durable. However, in a new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock signals the opposite conclusion, saying its conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term relevance remains intact despite short-term market weakness. The firm frames Bitcoin as a decades-long structural theme shaped by adoption curves, liquidity depth, and the declining credibility of legacy monetary systems. While this view acknowledges volatility, it argues that Bitcoin’s strategic value is accelerating faster than its price suggests. That tone contrasts with a market where each pullback often renews questions about institutional endurance. A central pillar of BlackRock’s argument is Bitcoin’s network-growth profile, which it describes as one of the fastest seen in any modern technology cycle. The filing cites adoption estimates showing that Bitcoin surpassed 300 million global users roughly 12 years after launch, outpacing both mobile phones and the early internet, which each took significantly longer to reach similar thresholds. For BlackRock, this curve is more than a data point. It reframes Bitcoin as a long-duration asset whose value reflects cumulative network participation rather than month-to-month price moves. The firm also includes a decade-long performance matrix showing that, despite wild swings in individual years, which often place Bitcoin at either the top or bottom of annual return tables, its cumulative and annualized performance still exceeds that of equities, gold, commodities, and bonds. That framing positions volatility as a built-in cost of exposure rather than a structural flaw. For an asset manager whose products are designed for multi-decade allocations rather than short-cycle momentum trades, temporary stagnation appears less like a warning and more like a familiar feature of Bitcoin’s cyclical rhythm. The filing also emphasizes that the asset’s current slowdown has not dented institutional participation. If anything, BlackRock argues, Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals of digital adoption, macroeconomic uncertainty, and the expansion of regulated market infrastructure continue to strengthen even as spot prices cool. A second theme in the filing is the argument that BlackRock’s own product, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has reshaped access to the asset in ways that support deeper institutional involvement. The firm highlights three areas, including simplified exposure, enhanced liquidity, and the integration of regulated custody and pricing rails. BlackRock stated that IBIT reduces operational frictions by allowing institutions to hold Bitcoin through a structure they already understand. According to the firm, custody risks, key-management issues, and technical onboarding, which have historically been barriers for institutions, are abstracted away in favor of traditional settlement channels. At the same time, BlackRock also highlighted liquidity as one of the most significant impacts IBIT has had on the market. Since its launch, the product has become the most actively traded Bitcoin ETF, contributing to tighter spreads and deeper order books. For large allocators, execution quality acts as a form of validation: the more liquid the product, the more institutionally acceptable the underlying asset becomes. Moreover, BlackRock also highlighted its multi-year infrastructure work with Coinbase Prime, regulated price benchmarks, and strict audit frameworks as evidence that Bitcoin exposure can now be delivered with standards comparable to equities or fixed income. Because of that design, the firm has processed more than $3 billion in in-kind transfers — a sign, it says, of institutional and whale confidence in its custody architecture. Notably, IBIT flows reinforce all of the points above. Since its launch, IBIT has emerged as the dominant Bitcoin ETF product in the market, with cumulative net inflows of $64.45 billion and over $80 billion in assets under management. In fact, IBIT’s inflows for this year have outpaced all of the combined flows recorded by the other 10 Bitcoin products in the market, according to K33 Research data. The most assertive section of the filing is labeled “global monetary alternative.” BlackRock describes Bitcoin as a scarce, decentralized asset positioned to benefit from persistent geopolitical disorder, rising debt burdens, and long-term erosion in fiat credibility. The firm does not frame Bitcoin as a direct replacement for sovereign currencies, but the implication is clear: the asset’s relevance increases as traditional monetary systems face stress. BlackRock also situates Bitcoin within a broader technological transition. As the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, Bitcoin functions as a proxy bet on the mainstreaming of digital-asset infrastructure, including blockchain-based payments, settlement systems, and financial market rails. In this context, Bitcoin has two intertwined identities as a monetary hedge and a technological exposure. This dual narrative helps explain BlackRock’s sustained bullishness. One pillar of the thesis is macroeconomic, tied to inflation dynamics, fiscal trajectory, and geopolitical fragmentation. The other is structural, tied to the ongoing global expansion of blockchain networks. Considering this, the recent slow price action does not meaningfully disrupt either thesis.

Title: Elizabeth Warren’s Forked Tongue: Leftism for Thee, But Not for Me

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Paul Sperry / @paulsperry_ Paul Sperry is an investigative reporter for RealClearInvestigations. When Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren recently traveled to the Big Apple to endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, she was asked if overt socialism is really the best model for Democrats to adopt. “You bet,” she replied in her signature folksy style. The Boston lawmaker wasn’t just jumping on the sudden trendiness of socialism three-and-a-half decades after its near-extinction. With Senate fellow traveler Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Warren has been a catalyst for moving her party to the left since her first campaign in 2012. She and Sanders are, in many ways, the godparents of the self-avowed democratic socialists such as Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who are providing the youthful energy for the Democrats in the Trump era. As Warren’s attacks on Wall Street and the wealthy are gaining even wider traction among liberals—a recent Gallup poll found 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism—the apparent contradictions between her public economic positions and private financial decisions are receiving new scrutiny, particularly as the onetime presidential candidate appears to be testing those waters again. Financial records examined by RealClearInvestigations show that Warren has hardly followed the path of socialism in her personal finances. Start with the redistribution of wealth. Warren tirelessly bashes the “selfish” and “greedy” rich for not paying their “fair share,” and demands the government step in and redistribute their income to the poor. But charity does not always begin in the Warren home. While Warren hauls in nearly $1 million a year, she donated less than 3% of her household income to charity in 2024, according to her tax returns. This is much less than the charity of the Obamas, for instance, who typically donate more than 20% of their earnings to the needy and philanthropic causes, and low for the average American in her income bracket, studies show. The average millionaire donates more than twice her share. It also appears that Warren opens her pocketbook wider when she’s running for national office and under a bigger media microscope. The $26,669 in charitable deductions Warren reported on her tax returns last year pales in comparison to the $81,858, or 9% of income, she reported as she launched her campaign for the White House in 2020. And the outspoken Democratic leader keeps her own tax burden down while calling for higher taxes on “millionaires and billionaires.” Records show Warren is not averse to taking maximum advantage of provisions in a tax code she denounces as unfair. She has, for example, written off used articles of clothing on her taxes and has had to correct past returns for inflating the value of those items. She’s also written off thousands of dollars in used books—and even in-flight Wi-Fi—to expense down business income. And she would exempt herself from her proposed “Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” which levies a surtax on those with a net worth above $50 million. With a net worth of at least $8 million (with estimates as high as $12 million), Warren has benefited handsomely from free market capitalism—even as she has spent most of her career in the public and educational sectors. Despite her frequent complaints that “the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households own 84% of American-held shares” of stock, she has invested the bulk of her money in stocks and bonds managed by Wall Street investment funds. These accounts are valued at between $1.9 million and $6.8 million, according to her most recent Senate financial disclosures, filed in April. (Values are given as ranges in the disclosure reports that members of Congress are required to file each year.) Although Warren has rarely traded individual stocks, records show the mutual funds where she has parked her millions—Vanguard and TIAA-CREF—hold a number of companies in industries that Warren has demonized, including Big Oil, Big Tech, and Big Pharma. Through these funds, for example, Warren has invested in Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA; Exxon and Shell; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Monsanto; Johnson & Johnson; and even NewsCorp.—the owner of conservative Fox News and the New York Post. Nevertheless, Warren has ripped “fat cat bankers” at Wells Fargo for preying on minority homebuyers and customers with “predatory” rates and “junk” fees, and also for “screwing” their own employees. She even demanded the Federal Reserve revoke Wells Fargo’s status as a financial holding company over “abusive and unlawful” practices. Warren has called for regulators to break up tech giants Amazon and Apple, which she claims are running monopolies. “I’m sick of freeloading [tech] billionaires” who “roll over everyone,” she said recently. Warren has described Exxon as a “bad actor” that contributes to global warming. She’s even accused the energy giant of “corporate perjury” by publicly denying its alleged role in warming and producing “fake research” to “mislead the American people about climate change.” The senator has also slammed Exxon for “imposing massive price increases on Americans [sic] families,” arguing “this corporate greed is inexcusable.” Environmental activist groups have called on her chosen retirement fund, TIAA, to divest from Exxon, along with the rest of its more than $78 billion in oil, gas, and coal assets, according to a recent estimate by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. They argue the fund is using contributions from investors like Warren to “destroy communities and the environment.” Last year, Warren bashed Donald Trump for capitulating to the oil industry. “Donald Trump has a deal for Big Oil: if they raise $1 billion and send him back to the White House, he’ll gut environmental protections and roll back Joe Biden’s progress in fighting climate change,” she asserted on the social media platform X. “It’s corruption, pure and simple. And it would be a disaster for our planet.” Slamming the president’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” earlier this year, Warren complained, “Trump’s tax cuts stand to benefit [the] highest-income earners.” She would know: She’s one of them. The $919,583 in household income Warren reported on her 2024 tax return she filed jointly with her husband puts her in the top 1% of highest-earning Americans. The year before she entered the Senate, Warren reported earning $616,181. The lawmaker’s base Senate salary of $174,000 accounts for just one-fifth of the total income she reported to the IRS. The rest comes from book royalties, dividends, capital gains, earned interest, retirement income, and husband Bruce Mann’s salary as a tenured Harvard professor. The Senate is often described as a Millionaire’s Club, and she fits right in: Her $8 million net worth would rank her as the 18th wealthiest member of the Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Warren’s net worth has risen each year since she was first elected to the Senate in 2012, while the median wealth of senators overall has declined, according to the think tank. Although Warren is just one of many millionaires in Congress, government watchdogs note her wealth is at odds with the stridency of her class-warfare rhetoric. “Elizabeth Warren poses as the champion of the underdog, but her policies strip middle- and lower-income Americans of opportunities to advance their lot and build wealth,” said John Berlau, director of finance policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, referring to her calls for more taxes and financial red tape. “By pursuing policies that keep others from moving up, Sen. Warren has emerged as an unlikely champion of the existing 1%.” Warren did not reply to requests for comment. Critics note that several of Warren’s former staff members have moved on to positions in the sectors she decries. In 2023, she declared, “The abuse of the revolving door is appalling,” particularly in the financial sector, which she claims is “rigged to help the wealthy and well-connected.” But records show her own office has served as a revolving door for the banks. For example, Wally Adeyemo, who served as her chief of staff when she was standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, went on to work as a senior adviser at investment giant BlackRock. At least six other Warren staffers who worked in her Senate office have worked as lobbyists, records show. In addition, several of her senior campaign aides have worked on K Street. “There is a history of a revolving door of Warren staffers and protégés at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau taking jobs at big Wall Street firms, such as BlackRock,” Berlau said. Homeownership is also key to wealth-building, but zoning restrictions often price the working class out of homes. Warren has fought against so-called NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) rules and has fiercely advocated for building more affordable housing in cities. She even backs Mamdani’s “social housing” proposal to let the New York state government seize private properties and convert them into public housing. However, Warren has chosen to live in affluent neighborhoods in Boston and in Washington, D.C., that are heavily zoned to exclude the construction of new housing units and price out the average homebuyer. Public financial statements do not disclose the 76-year-old legislator’s real estate holdings, but other records show she owns at least two homes valued at more than $5 million. Her primary residence is located in the leafy Avon Hill section of Cambridge, Mass., which has enforced a century-old zoning system of minimum lot sizes, minimum parking requirements, floor area ratios, limits on units per building, and height restrictions. The restrictions have yielded a housing shortage in the city that has driven up the value of existing homes—including Warren’s 1876 Victorian mansion, which has risen eightfold to an estimated $4 million since she bought it in 1995. Records show she and her husband owe no mortgage on their nearly 4,000-square-foot home, which features three stories, high ceilings, marble mantels, hardwood floors, and a four-car garage. The median price for a home in Cambridge now tops $2.2 million. “The astronomical increase in the value of Warren’s home, and home prices in Cambridge more generally, has not happened in a vacuum,” said Scott Van Voorhis, a Boston real estate analyst. “The city’s special blend of upscale NIMBYism and restrictive zoning laws and regulations kept new house, condo, and apartment construction to a trickle at best, even as demand for living in the city increased leaps and bounds.” Though the Cambridge City Council earlier this year loosened its zoning ordinances to permit more housing across the city, Warren’s neighborhood remains largely exempt from reforms. That’s because Avon Hill is a conservation district further regulated by the Cambridge Historical Commission. Records show Warren’s street and home are located within the historic district, which protects old Victorians from being torn down for multifamily housing. That makes her neighborhood the ultimate safe NIMBY zone. “Nothing has been built [in her neighborhood] for decades beyond the occasional mansion upgrade,” Van Voorhis noted. Warren clearly understands there is a housing supply problem in Boston. In July, she helped shepherd the ROAD to Housing Act through the Senate, which, among other things, would provide grants to communities that change their land-use rules to make it easier to build new housing units. “We have a real problem here in Massachusetts that we simply don’t have enough housing,” Warren explained to The Boston Globe, noting the state is about 200,000 units short of what is needed. “If we don’t start building more housing here, the housing crisis will continue to intensify.” But when it comes to her own neighborhood—one of the least affordable in the state—she remains silent. Cambridge City Council members noted they didn’t hear “a peep” from Warren when they were recently debating zoning reforms to deal with the city’s growing housing affordability crisis. In 2013, when Warren bought her home in Washington, D.C., she also happened to select an area of the capital city where zoning restrictions have entrenched the status quo. Valued at more than $1 million, her condo is in the trendy Penn Quarter section of the District of Columbia, which is a historic area protected by land-use rules. Most famously, Warren’s personal decisions seem at odds with the Left’s leavening of traditional socialist positions with identity politics. Before moving to the Senate, Warren was a tenured professor at Harvard with a lucrative salary. Although the school denies that her claims to Native American ancestry influenced their decision to hire her, she and the administration trumpeted her diverse background. Warren also listed herself as a racial minority in a legal directory distributed by the Association of American Law Schools and was listed as a Native American in federal forms filed by Harvard Law School. When she launched her political career in 2012 and released a memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” Warren described her alleged “Native American roots” as a Cherokee. Henry Holt & Company paid her a $525,000 advance for the book, which became a national bestseller that still earns her royalties. She also helped publish a cookbook, “Pow Wow Chow,” exploiting the myth of her Native American lineage. Warren took in $430,000 a year as a tenured Harvard Law professor by claiming a Native American heritage—even as she has railed against whites appropriating minority culture or pretending to understand minority experiences. But, as she ramped up her run for the White House, Warren responded to persistent challenges of this claim by taking a DNA test. In late 2018, her campaign maintained it showed “strong evidence” of Native American ancestry dating back generations. When that failed to quiet her critics, Warren basically had to acknowledge that the test revealed that she is as little as 1/1,024th Native American, making her less of that ancestry than the average white American. She also eventually apologized to the Cherokee Nation in 2019. The year before that admission, however, she lectured others during her Senate campaign about stolen valor: “It is wrong and cowardly for people to make fraudulent statements in order to receive distinctions that they have not earned. We need to ensure that no one can benefit from making false claims and steal the true valor of the courageous.” “If there ever were a genuine case of cultural appropriation, Sen. Warren is guilty of it,” said Gad Saad, a business professor at Concordia University, adding: She literally appropriated Native American culture as her own by constructing a false narrative about her ancestry. “And yet,” he added, “she benefited for several decades from this false narrative, both in her academic and political career.” Saad and others who have closely followed her career suggest the progressive senator appears to have a “good for me, but not for thee” ethic when it comes to her own personal ambitions. Though she’s carefully groomed a reputation as a fighter for the “have-nots” against the “haves,” the record shows that, outside the spotlight, she has often pursued her own interests and followed the path of the haves.

Title: Home debut a 'pretty special' experience for O'Brien

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist After his short international career to date had taken him through Tbilisi, Lisbon and Chicago, Tommy O'Brien was finally able to enjoy the real deal at home. The 27-year-old Dubliner won his fourth Irish cap in Saturday's 41-10 win against Japan, but his first in front of an Aviva audience. Friends and family in the crowd, Amhrán na bhFiann, and a different kind of nervous excitement. "That was pretty special," he said of the experience. "I had some family out. My grandparents came out; they haven’t been to a game since I was probably 18. They’re proper glory supporters, they came out for the Irish game. No, I’m only messing. "I was having a look during the anthems to see if I could spot anyone but I didn’t, which was probably a good thing. It might have sent me over the edge. But it was good, really special." The Leinster wing (below) was the standout player in an otherwise forgettable game of rugby, earning the man of the match award for a performance that saw him run for 143 metres off 12 carries, while making four clean breaks and winning two turnovers. He capped the day off with a try right at the end, but it was a score that capped off an excellent individual display rather than one which defined it. Drifting inside Sam Prendergast off a turnover, O’Brien steamed onto a delicate offload from the out-half before stepping on the gas to score his fifth international try, and first at Lansdowne Road. "Me and Sammy were on the same page, I could see he was going across but he didn’t have the wheels to take it the whole way so I dropped under him and he knew what I was going to do. It was nice to be on the same page like that. "I gave a nice little fist pump into the crowd afterwards, which was cool, but I was blowing hard getting back. "Sammy gave me a nice 50-metre run-in so I had to give it my all. I couldn’t get caught there!" The Blackrock man has taken to international rugby excellently after injuries forced his career to stutter during his mid-20s. He dipped his toe into the Test game during the summer versus Georgia and Portugal, scoring two tries in each of those games, and with Mack Hansen out injured, he was retained in the 14 shirt for the first two matches of this Quilter Nations Series block. "Obviously the summer tour was great to get in and get a taste of it, and then the last few weeks were a step up in terms of the level," he said. "The All Blacks game was very physical but I felt like I belonged at that level. I didn’t feel like I was shocked or anything like that but it’s just the margins are very small and you’ve got to nail every little small moment." FT: Ireland 41-10 Japan Much better from Ireland in the second half with Tommy O'Brien with their final try in their win over Japan at the Aviva Stadium. 📺 RTÉ2 🖥️ https://t.co/b2OI4OoWVJ ✍️ https://t.co/x26q4bjNM0 pic.twitter.com/B3s3dgkVmz It has taken O'Brien longer than he would have liked to become an Ireland international, but that isn't necessarily a negative as he reflects on the player he is today. "I'm also probably a lot more mature than I would have been, maybe if I was 22 or 23 or whatever. "So that probably helps me in terms of not being as nervous coming into the games. "I feel like I've worked very hard. I've had so many downs, so I just enjoy these kind of experiences, in these days. "I guess when you’re in [the game] it’s another rugby game, you’ve been doing it your whole life. I’ve been playing it since I was four years old. It’s kind of what I’ve been telling myself before I go out, 'it’s just another game of rugby’. "Obviously, you want to be able to feed off the crowd and the magnitude of everything and allow yourself to go to another level in terms of finding stuff within you physically that you didn’t realise you had, and using the crowd in that capacity. "But in terms of weighing on you and nervousness, I’ve actually been okay thankfully. Yeah really enjoying myself so far." © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Liberal Elites Kicked the Door Wide Open for Trump’s Flagrant Corruption

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The president’s corruption is audaciously out in the open, but decades of letting the wealthy play by their own rules enabled him. Dylan is a senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project, where she leads RDP’s Economic Media Project. In his first term, Donald Trump appeared to be gunning for the title of most corrupt president in U.S. history. But after taking advantage of four years on the sidelines to ruminate about how to do better, he’s blown all competition completely out of the water in the nine months since retaking the Oval Office. Trump set off a media firestorm in 2017 by breaking from tradition and not placing his assets in a blind trust, instead choosing to entrust them to his children. The conflicts of interest invited by this farce were met with lawsuits, and #Resistance activists spoke about the emoluments clause of the Constitution as though they were constitutional law professors. Some reporting called this a “halfway blind” trust, which is sort of like a halfway-cooked chicken in that, for practical purposes, it’s a nonstarter. But after Trump left office in 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuits, and Merrick Garland, Biden’s spineless attorney general, slow-rolled any investigations into the former president. Faced with few consequences for this first round of graft, Trump and company have flouted even the appearance of adhering to ethical guidelines since his reelection in November. The presidential transition process was delayed by the Trump campaign not filing internal ethics guidance for the transition team, and the inauguration fund’s coffers were filled with many millions of dollars from donors eager to get on the president’s good side. That panhandling set the tone for the administration. In October, a Trump benefactor gave $130 million to stave off what would have been a major political liability and cover the paychecks for service members during the government shutdown. The office space Eleanor Roosevelt once occupied has been unceremoniously bulldozed to make way for a gargantuan ballroom, also being funded by corporate “donations” from the likes of BlackRock, Booz Allen Hamilton, and tech giants like Apple and Amazon. The sticker price of the project has soared from $200 million to $350 million. To add insult to injury, the donors will likely write off their bribes to the latest Trump event venue as charitable contributions, as economist Dean Baker laid out. The president is working to intervene in negotiations around the sale of Warner Brothers–Discovery to ensure that his longtime supporters, the Ellisons, are able to add on to their growing media empire. And that’s just the past couple of weeks! It’s not for nothing that my colleagues at the Revolving Door Project have had more than enough material for a biweekly rundown in our Corruption Calendar. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also recently published a timeline tracking national and state corruption since January 20. While Trumpian corruption is striking in frequency, scale, and just how routine it is starting to feel, this administration was the logical endpoint of the long-standing tradition of elite impunity. The second Trump administration is a striking monument to governmental misconduct, but the ground was broken long ago, with both parties laying the foundation. For the past half century, corporate and white-collar crime have gone largely unenforced. This was the result of both a widespread shift in views of governance (à la the Reagan Revolution) and a coordinated plan orchestrated to enable private wealth to hijack our democracy, as David Sirota and Jared Jacang Maher documented in their new book “Master Plan,” building on a podcast of the same name. Trump himself is a byproduct of the wealthy being empowered to violate the law. Seemingly his entire pre-government career was predicated on getting away with gaming bankruptcy law, committing widespread financial fraud, and racial discrimination. Now, in government, he is employing the “blitzscaling” model pioneered by firms like Uber to break the law faster than anyone can keep up with. The relentlessness of the Trump administration’s criminality is the point; it becomes borderline impossible to tackle any single instance of corruption if two more spring up by the time you finish reading up on it. This “flood the zone” strategy has been the hallmark of Trump 2.0. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

Calls for Democrats to find their way back from the wilderness by forcefully rebuking corporate influence and corruption, something we at the Revolving Door Project have been urging as the cornerstone of progressive politics for years, are multiplying. Politicians, notably Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, both Democrats, are emerging as anti-corruption champions. To mount a real anti-corruption agenda, though, Democrats must go farther than just condemning the sundry glad-handing of Trump world. There is no appetite for going back to the halcyon days when everyone knew the legal code was merely a suggestion for corporate titans and the ultra-rich, even as they masqueraded as law-abiding citizens. “ Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules.” The Great Recession was a turning point; the extent of corporate lawbreaking in the financial sector was laid bare. And, famously, hardly anyone ever went to jail. Obama-era regulators, in many ways the acme of our last half-century of the hands-off approach to ruling-class misconduct, earned rebuke and scorn as “the chickenshit club,” afraid to square up against the powerful, if not overtly committed to serve elite interests. Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules. Trump’s first election was, in part, built on the argument that he knew “how to play the game.” In this telling, his ability to break the rules was actually an asset because he would break them for you rather than just for the powerful. It was always a dubious pitch, but it’s understandable why — faced with the choice between someone trying to convince you the game that’s obviously been fixed is actually not rigged, and someone who tells you how they cheat and promise to help you get ahead a little bit — people would gravitate toward the latter. Part of the early MAGA mythos was built on resignation to the fact that our rule of law is fundamentally perverted to create two parallel tracks of justice: an unforgiving, punitive, carceral system for most people, and a cushy, consequence-free dinner party circuit for the ruling class. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged. Dethroning Trump will not be enough to restore real rule of law; the Biden administration is proof enough of that. Donald Trump was excised from the White House with historically bad public sentiment in the immediate aftermath of a failed coup. Under Biden, the Garland Justice Department tried to wind the clock back to 2016 and resume operating the way establishment politicians did in the 1990s and 2000s. It failed spectacularly, allowing bad actors like Elon Musk to grow ever more powerful while continuing to flout the law with impunity. The result was an embittered Trump who faced no real repercussions for his corruption — the worst-case scenario. If and when Democrats control the executive branch again, they will have an even more daunting task after the second Trump term than they did the first, and their existing body of work does not inspire confidence. Business-as-usual enforcement did not fail to rein in corruption over the last four years because of strategic missteps. It failed because it is incapable of rooting out undue elite influence that’s baked into the very essence of the way we became accustomed to enforcing the law. Trump is an extreme example, but he is the logical extreme. As Trump pardons business associates, sets up meetings for his children’s business interests with foreign leaders, and grows his personal wealth, the consequences of failing to hold the powerful to account are more obvious than ever. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged and the Trumpian appeal to America’s id will stay firmly entrenched. To dislodge the hold that corruption has on our government and restore the rule of law, Democrats will need to decide who they really are — and who they’ll fight for. IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT. What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.

Get ready for a four-day trading week—if you trade bonds. With several key economic reports expected to be delayed by the government shutdown, investors will this week focus largely on corporate earnings reports. And some will get a short break: Bond markets, banks and government offices will close Tuesday for the Veterans Day holiday, though stock markets will remain open. Earnings from Walt Disney, CoreWeave, Sony, Cisco, and Applied Materials highlight this week’s corporate calendar. The small business optimism survey for October comes as market watchers are paying attention to how economic pressures are impacting small firms.

Title: JPMorgan Discloses 64% Increase In BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holdings In 2025 Q3 — Details

Global banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase has disclosed its increased exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency through BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). In the latest 13-F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), JPMorgan disclosed its holding of 5,284,190 IBIT shares, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, as of September 30. This third-quarter figure represents a sharp 64% increase in the firm’s exposure to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. JPMorgan’s IBIT holdings, which were worth about $333 million as of September 30, are now valued at around $312 million. While the bank’s expanded position places it amongst one of the major institutional holders of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, it still sits behind other firms, like Goldman Sachs, with significantly larger holdings. Goldman Sachs disclosed that it held 30.8 million shares of IBIT in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, the filing with the SEC shows that JPMorgan held IBIT call options worth $68 million and put options worth $133 million as of September 30. The increased investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs is consistent with the bank’s price expectations for the flagship cryptocurrency. In a recent report, strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team shared that deleveraging in the crypto derivatives market, especially Bitcoin perpetual futures, appears to be mostly over. The JPMorgan analysts revealed that the recent rise in gold volatility has made BTC a more attractive investment option on a risk-adjusted basis. Using this gold-based model, the pundits argued that Bitcoin is fairly undervalued compared to gold and could see a significant upward movement to around $170,00 over the next 6 to 12 months. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $102,900, reflecting an over 1% jump in the past 24 hours. However, the premier cryptocurrency is still deep in the red on medium-term timeframes. According to data from CoinGecko, the BTC price is down by more than 6% in the last seven days. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has somewhat struggled over the past few weeks, registering significant withdrawals in the last two. According to data from SoSoValue, the exchange-traded fund posted a weekly net outflow of over $403 million in the previous week. Excluding its performance on Friday, November 7, BlackRock’s IBIT looks set to record a weekly net outflow of roughly $450 million. Nevertheless, the iShares Bitcoin Trust still ranks as the largest spot BTC exchange-traded fund with a net asset of $80.58 billion under management.

Title: Ian O’Riordan: Booming club numbers is not all good news

Rian Farrell was likely caught unawares this week when carving his name into the long annals of Irish athletics history. In registering with North Sligo AC, Farrell helped grow the Athletics Ireland club membership to 75,000 and it’s already tipped beyond that. November registration – when annual membership is counted – has now peaked at 75,078. It may have been a small gesture to name Farrell as their 75,000th member, but this is a big deal for Athletics Ireland, the governing body of the sport which has existed under various guises going back to the Irish Champions Athletic Club (ICAC) founded in 1873. It marks a 7 per cent increase on last November’s registration figure of 70,320 (the first to surpass the 70,000-mark), which in turn was a 9 per cent increase on the peak 2023 registration. All indications are the only way is up. Athletics, like many sports, also suffered a significant drop off in club membership during Covid-19. Registration more than halved in the first 12-month period during the pandemic, from 45,306 at the end of February 2020 to 19,702 at the end of February 2021. Growing that number above 75,000 is certainly impressive, and can be attributed to a variety of factors – not least in seeing Irish athletes enjoy their most successful ever year on the international stage. From the World Championships down to the European Youth Olympics, 21 medals were won, seven more than the previous best of 14 in 2019. In 2016, the international medal tally was three. [ Sonia O’Sullivan: With awards season upon us, Kate O’Connor should pick and chooseOpens in new window ] Role models and inspirations like this will help boost any sport and membership numbers are soaring across all ages and competitive levels. There is also a return of the running boom, the global phenomenon witnessed again last Sunday when there were 59,266 finishers in the New York City Marathon – breaking the previous record of 56,640 which finished the London Marathon last April. Athletics Ireland also pointed to the increased engagement at schools and community level and the rise in the number of athletics coaches trained through its education programmes. Until recent decades, Athletics Ireland and its many predecessors – including the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann (BLE) - were only concerned with the competitive end of the sport. As, in turn, were most of the athletics clubs. Not anymore. It’s not the winning that matters, it’s the taking part, and that goes for the roughly 360 clubs throughout all 32 counties. [ Ireland’s Fionnuala McCormack finishes 10th in New York City MarathonOpens in new window ] Yet, behind these numbers, many clubs are struggling to meet the demand for new membership. Particularly at juvenile level, with significant waiting lists now being the norm, especially among the biggest clubs in the country. That’s not good news, not if any young aspiring athletes are ultimately lost to other sports. Dundrum South-Dublin AC, better known as DSD, is a case in point. It’s far from the oldest club in Dublin – and positively modern compared to the likes of Clonliffe Harriers, founded in 1886, and Donore Harriers, founded in 1893. With 1,200 members, DSD is now the biggest athletics club in Ireland, but not alone in turning away younger members because there simply isn’t enough room. The club was founded 40 years ago, with the merging of Dundrum AC and South Dublin AC, and for lifelong DSD member Gerry McGrath, the first decade or two was about maintaining club membership at around 150. Enough to keep everyone happy, even if there was a struggle sometimes to find that critical fourth man on the club cross-country team. The 1,200 members are now perfectly split between a 50:50 gender balance, all the way up from under-8s to over-70s, and an even half of which, around 600, are juveniles (under-18). There is also that waiting list, which averages about 200. [ ‘Setting big dreams’: Where Ava Crean, Ireland’s newest marathon sensation, might go nextOpens in new window ] “It’s a pity we can’t take everyone,” says McGrath, “but that primary school age is quite intensive, in that you need one coach for every 10 kids. A kid at that age could also be on the waiting list for a few different athletics clubs. Because most of the Dublin clubs do have a waiting list at those ages. “We did have a strategic plan, a few years ago, to grow the club to 2,500 members. But we’re not actively recruiting in any area at the moment, we stalled all that last year, until we could get more of a grip on it. That might change, but we still have physical limitations. Even though we’re one of the best served clubs in terms of our own track and our own running trails.” It’s just three years since DSD opened its own home track and trails off Tibradden Road, just up the hill from its former natural training ground at Marlay Park. That project continues to expand with the addition of new indoor running straight and club hall, set to open next year. As well as the surge in demand for juvenile membership, McGrath also points to the growth in DSD’s training group – now rebranded as the Meet, Train & Race. “That started 15 years ago, with maybe three or four guys, maybe in their late 40s, who wanted to run a marathon for the first time. “Now our Meet & Train is well over 200 members, attracting a few new members every week. We had 80 members in the Dublin Marathon last month. The sport is surging at all levels like that. “The problem isn’t getting volunteer coaches. We have 130 volunteers, some who would do seven days a week, all voluntary, to maybe a mother or father, who helps out for an hour. But it still takes tremendous coordination.” Blackrock AC is another southside Dublin club that is booming, with a celebratory dinner in January to mark its 1,000 members for the first time. On the northside, Raheny Shamrock is developing its first home facility at St Assam’s Church, again to help meet the growing demand for membership. It all makes for healthy reading for Athletics Ireland, as long as waiting lists for juveniles don’t come at the cost of kids being lost to the sport.

Title: Bitcoin fell from 2025’s ‘hottest trade,’ but attention will return: Alex Thorn

Bitcoin is entering a much more “mature era” that is healthy for the asset and will see attention returning, according to Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn. Optimism around Bitcoin (BTC) was far stronger at the start of the year, but it may not be long before the cryptocurrency regains that same level of hype, according to Galaxy Digital’s head of research, Alex Thorn. “Attention will come back to Bitcoin, it always does,” Thorn said during an interview with CNBC on Friday, emphasizing that “Bitcoin was the hottest trade of the year at the start of the year” after Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election. Thorn said investors have turned their attention toward areas like AI, nuclear energy, quantum technology, and gold. “There were a lot of other places to get gains this year that impeded the allocation to Bitcoin,” he said. “We’re entering a much more mature era, where distribution from old hands to new is incredibly healthy for distributing the ownership of Bitcoin,” Thorn added. While Thorn remains long-term bullish on Bitcoin, he reduced Galaxy Digital’s year-end price target to $120,000 from $185,000. A move to $120,000 represents an increase of around 17% from Bitcoin’s current price of $102,080, according to CoinMarketCap. Many of the sectors Thorn said are pulling investor attention away from Bitcoin, especially gold, are the same ones it’s often compared to. JPMorgan analysts recently said that the rise in gold volatility during its rally to all-time highs in October makes the precious metal riskier and Bitcoin “more attractive to investors,” based on the Bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio falling to 1.8, meaning BTC carries 1.8 times the risk of gold. As for AI, it was reported on Oct. 10 that Bitcoin and Nvidia stock (NVDA) are now moving more in sync than at any point in the past year. That has some market watchers worried about a looming crash similar to the dot-com bubble era in the late 1990s. Related: Arthur Hayes says Zcash has become his family office’s second-largest holding after Bitcoin Meanwhile, the ongoing debate over the potential threat of quantum computing to Bitcoin continues to divide experts. Borderless Capital’s Amit Mehra recently said quantum computing remains years away from threatening Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole, said the situation is far more urgent and argues that the industry must implement solutions as soon as possible before it is too late.

Title: ‘Unusual’ Paul Henry coastal landscape bought by taoiseach John A Costello could fetch €150,000 at auction

Paul Henry’s Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry A painting believed to have been bought directly from Irish artist Paul Henry by the late taois­each John A Costello will be offered for sale at auction later this month. Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers, which is estimated to be worth €150,000, is one of two Henry paintings Costello left to his children. He died in 1976, aged 85. Dubliner Costello was also a barr­ister, attorney general and Fine Gael TD. He was taoiseach twice, from 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957. James O’Halloran, director of ­Adam’s auction house in Dublin, said they sold one of the paintings “almost a decade ago and now we have been consigned the second”. The previous painting was sold for €115,000. Mr O’Halloran said it “is thought by his family that John A purchased the two paintings directly from the artist as there is no record of them being in any exhibition. The painting is unusual as it has two Irish traditional sailing boats, known as hookers, in it”. It has remained in the family since. Costello’s son Declan was also attorney general, and president of the High Court. He died in 2011 at the age of 84. Other works of interest in the upcoming auction is an oil painting by Jack B Yeats, dated to 1912 and entitled In a Dublin Waxworks, with an estimate of €70,000. Previously belonging to Guinness heir Garech Browne, it hung for many years in Luggala Estate in Co Wicklow. Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry Yeats visited the old Dublin Waxworks in Henry Street in 1905 and made a sketch that he used as the basis for the work. It has a historical significance as a glimpse of a lost Dublin institution, which burnt down two years after the painting was completed. Sculpture is prominent in the sale, with works in bronze by Melanie Le Brocquy, John Behan, Imogen Stuart and Rowan Gillespie. Adam’s pre-Christmas sale of Important Irish Art will take place on November 26 in their St Stephen’s Green rooms at 6pm, and includes about 150 lots. Last week, deVeres auction house on Kildare Street in Dublin saw demand for Eileen Gray-designed items soar. Her famous Transat chair was sold for €10,500. It had an estimate of between €4,000 and €6,000. A blue leather bar stool designed by the renowned architect sold for €4,200; it had an estimate of €1,200. A Jumo lamp designed by Gray was valued at between €600 and €900 but went for €2,800. A set of six rosewood dining chairs by Danish designer Neils Moller made €10,500 - more than three times the asking price. A Svend Ge Madsen-designed Rosewood desk went for €7,000, more than double its estimate of between €2,000 and €3,000. Elsewhere, Adams Blackrock has an exclusive one-off jewellery auction featuring more than 750 pieces consigned by a long-established Irish jeweller that is closing its doors. Elena McCrory, senior associate with Adams Blackrock, said there has been an increase of “younger people interested in vintage jewellery due to sustainability and price. The price of gold has increased substantially, so nine-carat gold pieces garner a lot of interest”. The selection showcases a wide range of contemporary gold jewellery set with precious gemstones. The auction will take place online on Thursday.

Title: The forgotten Irish artist: How does an artist make thousands of artworks, then just disappear?

Great work tends to announce itself even without the benefit of hype. Many moons ago, when Paul Finucane was involved in setting up the medical school at the University of Limerick, in 2007, he and his colleagues decided to establish a collection of medicine-related art for the benefit of students at the college. “I came across a painting called Embryo with Gas Mask at an auction house,” Finucane says. A provocative piece, the work had been used, with its artist’s permission, on an anti-nuclear-power poster in the 1970s. “It’s the notion of an embryo needing to be protected from the environment by having a gas mask,” Finucane says. “While it’s a challenging image, there’s no question about the quality of the draughtsmanship.” Its creator’s name was Donal O’Sullivan. Finucane, a keen collector as well as founding dean of the school of medicine, embarked on a little detective work to learn more about him. This obscure artist, he discovered, had been prolific in the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Dublin, he had gone against the expressionism that was fashionable in Irish art circles at the time, trading instead in powerful, elegant and melancholy figurative art that often discomfited its viewers. A prize winner and college activist, O’Sullivan had been a mover and shaker in his early life; at one point he appeared in the front row of the audience of The Late Late Show to protest against inadequate facilities at the National College of Art, resulting in important reforms. Then mental-health frailties set in. O’Sullivan died by suicide in 1991, aged just 46. In subsequent decades, he was largely forgotten by the art world, his work left to gather dust. It was, Finucane says, an unfortunate lack of recognition. That oversight is being addressed in a handsome book about O’Sullivan’s life and work, which gathers together his creations with reminiscences from Robert Ballagh, Vincent Browne, Annie West, Una Sealy and Cóilín Murray, among other well-known names, along with deeply felt reflections from family and other friends. Finucane and Brendan Lyons of Red Barn Publishing, in west Co Cork, who suggested the book to mark what would have been O’Sullivan’s 80th birthday this year, hope to establish him as an important artist. “We tend to gravitate to stories around people who have not received the attention they deserve,” Finucane says. “Donal was someone who was able to argue for a cause but unable to do the same for his own work and career,” Lyons says. “He was a conundrum.” Ballagh, who wrote the foreword to the book, knew O’Sullivan as a young man – he had been friends with his brother – and appreciated his hard-won skill as a figurative artist. “My studio is in Stoneybatter, and opposite where I am there’s a rather large house which he had a flat in,” Ballagh says. “I used to bump into him. To develop the kind of skills that Donal had takes years and years of endeavour and commitment. Anyone who had an interesting face interested Donal. He was fascinated with Samuel Beckett’s face, with Alberto Giacometti’s face.” Born in 1945 in Dublin, O’Sullivan was, Ballagh says, a shy man who was “also quite convinced of what he was doing”. When he was growing up, his parents, Mary and Patrick, ran a grocery in Ranelagh called Lily’s Dairy. Donal was the fifth of six children, a dreamy character who loved playing with his toy soldiers and drawing constantly, taking the greaseproof paper that separated the layers of Coconut Cream biscuits and working faces into the stains left on the paper. [ How did a small Irish architectural firm come to design one of the world’s biggest museums?Opens in new window ] “He enjoyed a bit of craic – as family we’d all have a loud laugh, and we’d sit together and the craic would bounce back and forth – but he was anxious nearly all of the time,” says his sister Marie O’Sullivan, a fellow artist, who also contributes to the book. “Even to go out the door it took effort.” After studying architecture for a year at Bolton Street College of Technology, in an effort to do something sensible, O’Sullivan switched to the National College of Art, then based on Kildare Street. It wasn’t long before his talents were noticed. He won the Taylor Prize twice, in 1967 and 1968, while at the college. Gerald Davis, of the Davis Gallery on Capel Street, offered him an exhibition while he was still a student, and Suzanne MacDougald showed his work at her Lad Lane Gallery. A distinctive presence dressed in black, with a helmet of hair and a Crombie coat, O’Sullivan had a painstaking working method that relied on sometimes frowned-upon techniques. He drew from images ripped from newspapers – a practice forbidden at art college – and would etch on bread paper, the thin tissue used to wrap loaves. He wasn’t a natural agitator, but he’d had the benefit of a good education as a student at Blackrock College, in South Dublin, and was dismayed by the deficiencies he found at the National College of Art, which was using outmoded methods of teaching, and in any case had inadequate premises. After months of peaceful protest, O’Sullivan, a charismatic spokesman for the student body, decided enough was enough. The students staged a sleep-in from April 22nd until May 28th, 1969. “If you want to protest about a situation, after everything else has failed, you just bring it to a halt, you have a work-in. If you want to stop something happening in a college, you occupy it,” he told The Irish Times on June 19th that year. The protests succeeded. In 1971 the college moved to its current location, on Thomas Street in the Liberties. “He’d be shy and anxious and on edge,” Marie O’Sullivan says of her brother. “But he wouldn’t let that stop him protesting. He would force himself to go in and talk to Brian Lenihan” – minister for education at the time – “and be that public if he felt strongly about something”. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries After graduating with an honours diploma, O’Sullivan set himself up in a chaotic studio in an old henhouse in the garden of his family home, on the corner of Ranelagh Road and Sallymount Avenue. A few chickens that remained would cluck over the work he discarded, leaving deposits to which he paid little heed. The hens weren’t his only challenge. The climate at the time was harsh on artists. O’Sullivan was prolific: his studio was crammed with discarded drawings in charcoal and pencil, some of famous names, such as Sinéad O’Connor. Over his lifetime he would make thousands of artworks. But they didn’t seem to offer a vital critique of Ireland in the manner of work by other artists of the day, and he struggled to promote himself, failing to turn up even to his own exhibition launches. He found his main employment as a teacher at Dún Laoghaire School of Art and Design. “Dublin was a grim city,” says Una Sealy, an artist and former student of O’Sullivan’s. “A lot of it was falling down. A lot of the Georgian buildings were either being demolished or held up with girders. There was massive unemployment. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries.” Figures such as Patrick Graham and Brian Maguire drove a particular creative vision. “They would have been the artists that people looked up to in the late 1970s and 1980s. Donal’s work was of a high standard, and it has held that quality. But there was a couple of decades when that would not have been in fashion.” Persuading people to buy art was itself quite a feat. “I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s,” Paul Finucane says, “and about the only thing you’d ever see in somebody’s house was a Sacred Heart lamp and a photograph of the pope and maybe John F Kennedy. To have any kind of original art would have been considered a gross waste of money.” A notice from the Evening Press in 1981 carps that O’Sullivan is “too shy to attend his own exhibition but has no handicap when it comes to putting a price on the tag. It’s a pity, really, that people of undoubted talent gain their exclusivity by putting their work out of reach of the many who have vacant places on their walls.” [ A Syrian artist who took refuge in Dublin: ‘Picasso came to this life to open a door. I hope I can open a door’Opens in new window ] Then there was the melancholy aspect to his work that sometimes put people off. “There’s a sadness to his work,” his sister says. “That’s what hits people. People see a kind of darkness. If I was to show his work to someone who has never seen it before, they would nearly always come back and say there’s a darkness or sadness to it.” At certain times in his life O’Sullivan was on medication for anxiety and depression. He became a heavy drinker. He had lengthy stays in hospital, where he seemed to have undergone electroconvulsive therapy: a handwritten poem reflects on the experience. There is great pain in Marie O’Sullivan’s voice when she talks about those periods. A section of the book is devoted to recollections of the Ana Liffey Drug Project, the addiction-aid service where O’Sullivan gave some art-therapy and counselling time. “It was amazing for him to put himself forward to try and help while he was still struggling,” she says. “He was involved in so many things.” By the time the artist died, in 1991, he had fallen out of touch with many of his old friends. When Brendan Lyons began tracking them down, many were delighted to have the opportunity to talk about O’Sullivan and his effect on them. At the book’s recent launch at Cnoc Buí Arts Centre, in Union Hall in west Cork, where Mel Mercier performed an original composition set to O’Sullivan’s poetry, several contributors spoke about their relationship with O’Sullivan, reflecting on his many gifts as a listener, encourager and friend. “I learned so much from him,” Joan Cronin, his former girlfriend, said. “He was generous with his knowledge. I enjoyed the arts, but he gave me the confidence to be critically thinking about it.” For Marie O’Sullivan, who has spent years seeking to re-energise interest in her brother’s art, the attention has been hugely gratifying. “There were so many stories. At the launch, things came up that I didn’t realise. Each person had their own little story of the time they spent with him. I didn’t actually break down – I was afraid I would – but I was very close to tears.” The contributors hope that the book will go some way towards restoring O’Sullivan to his rightful place in Irish art and that curators might pay more attention to his work. “I’d be much more interested in some of the institutions taking an interest in him than the auction houses,” Ballagh says. For Sealy, it’s important that a younger generation of artists become acquainted with him. “Younger artists won’t know who he is,” she says. “He was a very important part of Irish art. What he has done has contributed to what people are doing now. It’s important that this record of his life has been compiled by Brendan and Paul. It’s cementing his legacy.” In a life cut short, the work still speaks, even now. “I’m optimistic,” Marie O’Sullivan says of the future. “Very optimistic.” Donal O’Sullivan: An Artist Remembered, by Paul Finucane and Brendan Lyons, is published by Red Barn; it is available from cnocbuiarts.ie/publications and selected bookshops Sign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum: How $10B short squeeze could fuel ETH past $4,500

Time Published: 2025-11-09T02:00:33Z

Here are top three factors that increased the odds of a short squeeze on Ethereum. Massive shorts above price on top of buyer activity and bullish sentiment increased the chances of a short squeeze. Only if the current momentum persists, breaking all resistances below the mark, can Ethereum reach $4,500. Ethereum[ETH] surged by only 5% in the recent market bounce after liquidating shorts that came in at the bottom. The market was showing signs of a reversal, with massive shorts at risk of liquidation. The addition of buy orders from whales and institutions on top of shifting sentiment all set the altcoin up for a run toward $4,500. As of press time, Ethereum price liquidated late short orders that came in below the $3,600 mark after dropping to $3,200. Massive shorts were building above the $3,600 zone, while those of latecomers were disappearing. Over $10 billion in Ethereum liquidity was stacked between $3,600 and $4,500, just above the current prices. Source: CoinGlass Based on current market patterns, Ethereum’s price may be approaching a key breakout zone. If buy orders push past the $3,600 level, it could trigger a rapid short squeeze, potentially driving the price beyond $4,500. Because liquidity is tightly clustered near these levels, short sellers may not have time to react. Whales and institutions were capitalizing on the dip as they were accumulating between $3,000 and $3,400. For instance, a Bitcoin insider whale who had shorted BTC just before the tariff crash took a long position on Ethereum. The whale placed a 5x leverage long on Ethereum, with the position amounting to 40,000 ETH valued at $138 million. His closure of the BTC long position was a hint that ETH could rise faster than Bitcoin in the current conditions. Source: Mister Crypto/X That was not the only buy on ETH. BlackRock also bought $35 million worth of Ethereum, as per CryptoGoos. This further supported a potential comeback for ETH price amid shifting market sentiment. Speaking of market sentiment, the crowd and smart money were all bullish on Ethereum. In fact, the informed money was more convinced than the retailers, as the sentiment gauge read 0.23 against 0.21. Source: Market Prophit This was reflected across the entire crypto market, which rose by 1.35%, at press time. All these observations pointed to a looming short squeeze that could take the price past $4,500. However, the charts indicated that for this price to be hit, short-term levels at $3,460, $3,900, and $4,200 had to be cleared. Source: TradingView Therefore, breaking these zones could push the price past $4,500, as all factors were aligning for such an undertaking.

Title: Amazon's AI comeback: Inside the cloud king’s race to close the Big Tech gap

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. For years, markets saw Amazon and Apple as laggards in the artificial intelligence race dominated by Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Though Amazon had a huge cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services (AWS), investors weren’t excited about the company. However, the narrative shifted when the company posted strong September quarter earnings. A deal with OpenAI and a ramp-up in its capital expenditure signalled that Amazon was back in the AI race. AI is just one of Amazon’s many concerns. How it manages its mammoth retail operations amid regulatory pressures matters too. Market catch-upIn the past few years, post-covid and during the AI boom, Amazon was an outlier among the Big Five tech companies, but for the wrong reasons. In the past five years, Amazon shares gained 51%, while its peers doubled or tripled their market value. As Nvidia boomed on the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and Microsoft captured headlines with its OpenAI tie-up, investors were concerned that AWS, a cloud leader and Amazon's key division, was struggling to scale. Amazon was spending heavily on AI infrastructure but was losing share to Microsoft and Google. In the second quarter of 2025, AWS’s profit margins fell sharply. The picture changed after Amazon's third-quarter earnings on 30 October 2025. Results exceeded expectations, and shares jumped 13% in after-hours trading. "There was definitely concern about AWS losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud," Argent Capital's Jed Ellerbroek told Reuters. “But now AWS is aboard the train as well." In the past five days, Amazon was the only Big Five stock to post gains, while the others declined. AWS revivalIn the September quarter, AWS reported revenues of $33 billion, up 20.2% from $27.5 billion in Q3 2024. It outpaced the segment's 19% growth in Q3 2024 and exceeded Wall Street's 18.1% forecast. The results lifted AWS’s annualized run rate to $132 billion. During the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that the division was "growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022," attributing this to "strong demand in AI and machine learning." It addressed investors’ concerns that AWS—which holds about 31% of global cloud infrastructure, according to recent Synergy Research data—might be struggling to manage scale.

It could also leverage other changes in the market, such as the friction between Microsoft and its long-standing partner OpenAI. Earlier this week, Amazon signed a $38 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI. The deal could increase its $200 billion backlog by about 20% in the fourth quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets. It also gave AWS a clearer path to recover market share lost to Microsoft and Alphabet. Capital pushTo sustain growth, Amazon has to sustain capital spending. In Q3 2025, its capex hit $35.1 billion, or 19.5% of revenue, up from 14.8% in Q4 2024. This ratio has climbed steadily: 16.1% in Q1 2025 and 19.2% in Q2. It raised full-year capital expenditure guidance to about $125 billion, with most of the funds going to AWS data centres that support AI workloads. Spending is expected to rise further in 2026. That level of investment places Amazon among the largest spenders in the technology sector. However, higher investments in AI infrastructure add to financial strain. Throughout its history, Amazon has pursued growth through efficiency, reflected in its founder’s philosophy: Your margin is my opportunity. A substantial share of its budget is directed toward in-house technologies like Trainium chips, reducing reliance on third-party GPUs. Amazon says its own chips provide 30–40% better price-performance than comparable GPUs. Customers like Anthropic are deploying hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips for models like Claude. Adoption is growing, but it still trails Nvidia. Also Read | Artificial intelligence’s next home: your eyes Labour rebalanceIn the recent quarter, Amazon reported a $1.8 billion pre-tax charge for severance related to planned job cuts, reflecting one of its largest corporate restructurings in years. The layoffs, affecting about 14,000 employees, were announced shortly before the earnings release. During the earnings call, Jassy said the cuts were not AI-driven. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people doing the actual work. And it can slow you down." While Jassy has emphasized culture, the broader context is a shift toward automation across Amazon’s operations. The company aims to automate 75% of its fulfillment network and has deployed more than one million robots globally. These investments suggest a gradual substitution of capital for labour. Amazon’s workforce totalled 1.56 million in 2024, roughly unchanged from two years earlier despite higher sales and output, but down from 1.6 million in the covid-hit 2021.

In physical retail, Amazon is scaling back its direct grocery experiment. The company said it was closing all 14 Amazon Fresh stores in the UK, signalling a retreat from a model that failed to gain traction. The focus is shifting to Whole Foods, where Amazon plans to expand locations and pilot a smaller ‘daily shop’ format designed for urban markets. It is also redirecting grocery efforts toward logistics, emphasizing same-day perishables delivery through Amazon.com. That service now reaches 1,000 US cities and is expected to double coverage by the end of 2025. Physical store revenue has remained steady at about $5.6 billion per quarter. As it experiments and expands its business, Amazon is also regularly facing regulatory and legal hurdles. It settled a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint over Prime subscriptions with a $2.5 billion charge, which includes $1 billion in penalties and $1.5 billion in refunds. A separate antitrust lawsuit from the FTC and 18 states remains pending, with a trial expected in 2027.

For years, markets saw Amazon and Apple as laggards in the artificial intelligence race dominated by Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Though Amazon had a huge cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services (AWS), investors weren’t excited about the company. However, the narrative shifted when the company posted strong September quarter earnings. A deal with OpenAI and a ramp-up in its capital expenditure signalled that Amazon was back in the AI race. AI is just one of Amazon’s many concerns. How it manages its mammoth retail operations amid regulatory pressures matters too. Market catch-upIn the past few years, post-covid and during the AI boom, Amazon was an outlier among the Big Five tech companies, but for the wrong reasons. In the past five years, Amazon shares gained 51%, while its peers doubled or tripled their market value. As Nvidia boomed on the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and Microsoft captured headlines with its OpenAI tie-up, investors were concerned that AWS, a cloud leader and Amazon's key division, was struggling to scale. Amazon was spending heavily on AI infrastructure but was losing share to Microsoft and Google. In the second quarter of 2025, AWS’s profit margins fell sharply. The picture changed after Amazon's third-quarter earnings on 30 October 2025. Results exceeded expectations, and shares jumped 13% in after-hours trading. "There was definitely concern about AWS losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud," Argent Capital's Jed Ellerbroek told Reuters. “But now AWS is aboard the train as well." In the past five days, Amazon was the only Big Five stock to post gains, while the others declined. AWS revivalIn the September quarter, AWS reported revenues of $33 billion, up 20.2% from $27.5 billion in Q3 2024. It outpaced the segment's 19% growth in Q3 2024 and exceeded Wall Street's 18.1% forecast. The results lifted AWS’s annualized run rate to $132 billion. During the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that the division was "growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022," attributing this to "strong demand in AI and machine learning." It addressed investors’ concerns that AWS—which holds about 31% of global cloud infrastructure, according to recent Synergy Research data—might be struggling to manage scale.

It could also leverage other changes in the market, such as the friction between Microsoft and its long-standing partner OpenAI. Earlier this week, Amazon signed a $38 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI. The deal could increase its $200 billion backlog by about 20% in the fourth quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets. It also gave AWS a clearer path to recover market share lost to Microsoft and Alphabet. Capital pushTo sustain growth, Amazon has to sustain capital spending. In Q3 2025, its capex hit $35.1 billion, or 19.5% of revenue, up from 14.8% in Q4 2024. This ratio has climbed steadily: 16.1% in Q1 2025 and 19.2% in Q2. It raised full-year capital expenditure guidance to about $125 billion, with most of the funds going to AWS data centres that support AI workloads. Spending is expected to rise further in 2026. That level of investment places Amazon among the largest spenders in the technology sector. However, higher investments in AI infrastructure add to financial strain. Throughout its history, Amazon has pursued growth through efficiency, reflected in its founder’s philosophy: Your margin is my opportunity. A substantial share of its budget is directed toward in-house technologies like Trainium chips, reducing reliance on third-party GPUs. Amazon says its own chips provide 30–40% better price-performance than comparable GPUs. Customers like Anthropic are deploying hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips for models like Claude. Adoption is growing, but it still trails Nvidia.

The layoffs, affecting about 14,000 employees, were announced shortly before the earnings release. During the earnings call, Jassy said the cuts were not AI-driven. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people doing the actual work. And it can slow you down." While Jassy has emphasized culture, the broader context is a shift toward automation across Amazon’s operations. The company aims to automate 75% of its fulfillment network and has deployed more than one million robots globally. These investments suggest a gradual substitution of capital for labour. Amazon’s workforce totalled 1.56 million in 2024, roughly unchanged from two years earlier despite higher sales and output, but down from 1.6 million in the covid-hit 2021.

The focus is shifting to Whole Foods, where Amazon plans to expand locations and pilot a smaller ‘daily shop’ format designed for urban markets. It is also redirecting grocery efforts toward logistics, emphasizing same-day perishables delivery through Amazon.com. That service now reaches 1,000 US cities and is expected to double coverage by the end of 2025. Physical store revenue has remained steady at about $5.6 billion per quarter.

Title: ZCash (ZEC) Euphoria Is Finally Here — Time To Cash In?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. ZCash (ZEC) has been one of the highlight performers in the cryptocurrency market over the past few months. Although the general digital asset market has faltered in recent weeks, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency has continued to ascend to new price highs. While the large-cap assets have been waxing and waning in terms of market value, the price of ZCash has been on a tear in the past week, breaking into the list of the top-20 largest cryptocurrencies in the sector. Now, the latest on-chain data suggests that euphoria is setting in the ZEC market. In a November 7 post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson revealed that the ZCash market might be overheating after weeks of significant upward price movement. According to the on-chain expert, the sentiment surrounding the coin seems to have finally reached the euphoria stage. Wedson noted that the group of network participants mostly behind this euphoria is the ZEC miners. This on-chain observation revolves around two primary metrics, including the Puell Multiple and the Hash Rate. For context, the Puell Multiple is a metric that correlates the issuance value of an asset to its 365-day moving average. This metric measures miners’ profitability on an annualized basis, signaling potential market tops or bottoms. According to the highlighted data from Alphractal, the ZCash Puell Multiple just hit an all-time high, indicating significantly high profitability for the miners. This on-chain signal also suggests that the ZEC price could still have more room for upside movement. Furthermore, Wedson revealed that the ZCash Hash Rate is on a rapid ascent, meaning that miners are devoting more computational resources to the privacy-focused network. As seen with the premier cryptocurrency, a rising Hash Rate often coincides with extended price rallies. Ultimately, the increasing Puell Multiple and rising Hash Rate signals strong network fundamentals for ZCash, which suggests that the price growth seen so far is not solely market speculation. As of this writing, the price of ZCash stands at around $714, reflecting an over 30% jump in the past 24 hours. Price action data shows that the ZEC coin is having the second-strongest annual performance in its history, having soared roughly 1,500% in the past year. In an earlier post on X, Wedson projected an extreme upside of around $1,650 for the price of ZCash. While the current ZEC price already suggests elevated risk for investors, reaching as high as $1,650 would represent full-on market euphoria.

Opeyemi is a proficient writer and enthusiast in the exciting and unique cryptocurrency realm. While the digital asset industry was not his first choice, he has remained absolutely drawn since making a foray into the space over two years. Now, Opeyemi takes pride in creating unique pieces unraveling the complexities of blockchain technology and sharing insights on the latest trends in the world of cryptocurrencies. Opeyemi savors his attraction to the crypto market, which explains why he spends the better parts of his day looking through different price charts. “Looking” is a rather simple way to describe analyzing and interpreting various price patterns and chart formations. However, it appears that is not Opeyemi’s favorite part - in fact, far from it. Being able to connect what happens on a price chart to on-chain movements and blockchain activities is what keeps Opeyemi ticking. “This emphasizes the intricacies of blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency market,” he would say. Most importantly, Opeyemi thinks of any market insights as the gospel, while recognizing that he is only a messenger. When he is not clicking away at his keyboard, Opeyemi is most definitely listening to music, playing games, reading a book, or scrolling through X. He likes to think he is not loyal to a particular genre of music, which can be true on many days. However, the fast-rising Afrobeats genre is a staple in Opeyemi’s Spotify Daily Mix. Meanwhile, Opeyemi is a voracious reader who enjoys a wide category of books - ranging from science fiction, fantasy, and historical, to even romance. He believes that authors like George R. R. Martin and J. K. Rowling are the greatest of all time when it comes to putting pen to paper. Opeyemi believes his reading of the Harry Potter series twice is proof of that. Indeed, Opeyemi enjoys spending most of his time within the four walls of his home. However, he also sometimes finds solace in the company of his friends at a bar, a restaurant, or even on a stroll. In essence, Opeyemi’s ambivert (haha! been searching for an opportunity to use the word to describe myself) nature makes him a social chameleon who is able to quickly adapt to different settings. Opeyemi recognizes the need to constantly develop oneself in order to stay afloat in a competitive and ever-evolving market like crypto. For this reason, he is always in learning mode, ready to pick up the slightest lesson from every situation. Opeyemi is efficient and likes to deliver all that is required of him in time - he believes that “whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.” Hence, you will always find him striving to be better. Ultimately, Opeyemi is a good writer and an even better person who is trying to shed light on an exciting world phenomenon - cryptocurrency. He goes to bed every day with a smile of satisfaction on his face, knowing that he has done his bit of the holy assignment - spreading the crypto gospel to the rest of the world.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3% — making this its worst week since President Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariff plan in April. Tech companies that have otherwise performed well this year were among those hardest hit, with Palantir’s stock price falling 11% this week, Oracle declining by 9%, and Nvidia losing 7%. These drops also come after earnings reports in which Meta and Microsoft indicated that they plan to continue spending heavily on AI (both companies were down about 4%). “Valuations are stretched,” Cresset Capital’s Jack Ablin told the WSJ. “Just the slightest bit of bad news gets exaggerated … and good news is just not enough to move the needle because expectations are already pretty high.” Economic factors like the ongoing government shutdown, declining consumer sentiment, and widespread layoffs are also likely dragging down the stock market. But the less tech-heavy S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average didn’t do quite as badly, with declines of 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively.

Title: Here’s Why The Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Are Down

Time Published: 2025-11-08T19:30:34Z

The Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are down today after a brief rebound yesterday. Crypto pundit Nobler has suggested that these price declines are due to price manipulation rather than a wave of sell-offs among investors. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are on the decline today, following significant gains yesterday. In an X post, Nobler stated that Binance, Wintermute, and BlackRock were all selling Bitcoin ahead of the Federal Reserve’s announcement. This explains the DOGE and SHIB decline given the meme coins’ correlation with the flagship crypto. Nobler alleged that these firms have sold over $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and continue to sell more. The pundit added that there was too much market manipulation. Bitcoin is currently struggling to hold above the $100,000 level, which has sparked a bearish sentiment towards the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. The Dogecoin price is currently trading way below the psychological $0.2 level, while the Shiba Inu price continues to underperform, down over 53% since the start of the year. The foremost meme coins are also at risk of a further decline, with speculations that the crypto market might already be in a bear market. Market maker Wintermute recently claimed that liquidity has stopped flowing into the crypto market, which is why the bull market has halted while the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices decline. The market maker further noted that momentum in stablecoins, ETFs, and digital asset treasuries (DATs) has slowed, highlighting a liquidity drain in the market. Notably, companies such as CleanCore and Bit Origin had accumulated DOGE earlier in the year but have since slowed their purchase of the foremost meme coin. Meanwhile, Santiment data also showed that there has been a drop in DOGE and SHIB whale transactions, which also explained the decline in the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Despite the recent decline in the Dogecoin price, crypto analyst XForce stated that the macro target for DOGE remains between $1 and $2, which would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the foremost meme coin. He noted that DOGE has arguably been one of the best idealized Elliot wave 5-wave structures on the macro up to the wave 4 termination point. Furthermore, XForce remarked that the only bullish option left will be observed as an Expanding Ending Diagonal, as impulsive options are now off the table. Meanwhile, crypto pundit SHIB Booster stated that the Shiba Inu price could rally soon as tokens from last bull season are now recording significant gains. The pundit added that a small wave of momentum could send the SHIB price back toward the mid-range, around $0.00001603. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: New Mass Effect Game to Feature Krogan Civil War

Yesterday was N7 Day, the yearly franchise appreciation day that Mass Effect developer BioWare has held every November 7 since 2012. In the game, N7 is a vocational code in the Systems Alliance military, where the N designates special forces and the 7 refers to the highest level of proficiency, thus referring to the main character, Shepard, and his strike team. N7 Day 2025 delivered confirmation that the studio, despite the layoffs, is still working on the next Mass Effect game. In the blog post, long-time Executive Producer Mike Gamble inserted a secret message that the fans eventually decoded, revealing a new artwork from the upcoming game. The art depicts Krogan characters and features the subtitle 'Civil War'. This hints at one of the themes we may discover in the game: a major division within the Krogan race between at least two factions. Those who have played previous Mass Effect games are certainly familiar with the Krogan, a species of large, reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka. They famously survived despite the harsh environment of their home world, only to destroy it themselves in a nuclear war. The survivors split into tribes that were constantly at war with one another. Indeed, they are considered a warrior race, but some of them do not necessarily wish to perpetuate the seemingly endless cycle of fighting that has characterized the Krogans. This may be the primary source of the disagreement, though it's only speculation at this point, of course. The next Mass Effect is at least three to four years away, and fans may have to make do with just art teasers in the near future. There is, however, the Amazon TV series in development, and BioWare confirmed that it will be an original story (written by Daniel Casey and directed by Doug Jung) set after the original Mass Effect trilogy. We'll keep you updated once there are casting news on the show.

Title: Tech Workers Are in Deep, Deep Trouble

By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 8, 2025 12:45 PM EST For years, any American kid eying a stable, future-proof job was told to “learn to code.” Now in 2025, anyone who followed that advice faces a painful reckoning: a decade of booming computer science enrollments has created a massive pile-up of graduates entering an abysmal job market. A new report by the analyst firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks layoffs across various industries, found that the US tech industry had the highest number of layoffs in October of any sector, with a whopping 33,281 tech workers out of the job. That’s an awfully high number for one month, and it looks even worse in context — just a month earlier, the number of tech industry layoffs was only 5,639. Tech companies are planning to lay off 141,159 jobs this year so far, per the report, up from 120,470 over the same period in 2024. And it likely may not look much better in the near future, either. “It’s possible with rate cuts and a strong showing in November, companies may make a late-season push for employees,” the report reads, “but at this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025.” The analysis was spotted by SF Gate, which reported that tech company job cuts in the US are at their highest levels since 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a short-lived recession. For the month of October, however, the analyst report notes that total layoffs haven’t been this high since 2003 — in other words, not even the global financial crisis was this much of a bloodbath. While it’s easy to blame AI for the tech industry layoffs, CG&C highlights some other factors contributing to the dismal labor news. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” the firm wrote. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes.” Across all industries, “those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market,” the report commentary read. The depressing economic news comes as tech companies look to be some of the first adopters of their own AI systems, a proving ground of sorts for the software they hope will bring about a new stage of human civilization. Last week, Amazon cut some 14,000 jobs within its corporate offices, with thousands more likely on the way. Over the summer, when Microsoft sacked 9,000 employees, its CEO suggested freshly-unemployed workers turn to AI chatbots to help “reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.” Meanwhile, there’s plenty of reason to doubt that AI is actually capable of replacing thousands of employees — a narrative tech executives have a material interest in maintaining. While some companies like Amazon were surely over-bloated following pandemic hiring sprees, AI is mostly failing when used to improve revenue streams, the reason companies execute these layoffs in the first place. The question, then, is how much deeper the layoffs are going to go — something only some of the most powerful corporate executives can answer.

Title: T Rowe Price’s Calculated Bet: Why the Quintessential “Singles Hitter” Is Swinging for Crypto
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/11/t-rowe-prices-calculated-bet-why-the-quintessential-singles-hitter-is-swinging-for-crypto/

In the buttoned-down world of institutional asset management, T Rowe Price has long been the firm that makes boring look brilliant. While competitors chased hot trends and flashy returns, the Baltimore-based firm built its reputation as the quintessential “singles hitter,” compounding modest, steady gains into industry-leading long-term performance through disciplined, research-driven processes. Which makes the 87-year-old firm’s October 2025 filing for the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF seem, at first glance, utterly out of character. Cryptocurrencies? The asset class synonymous with wild volatility, 70%+ drawdowns, and a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to a wall? For a firm that has weathered every market cycle since 1937 by staying boringly sensible? Yet for those who understand T Rowe Price’s culture, the move is precisely in character. Because when Price’s research leads somewhere, the firm follows, even when it means moving ahead of the crowd into uncomfortable territory. Price is decidedly not an early mover. The filing comes nearly two years after the SEC’s watershed January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which triggered what one analysis called “a 400% acceleration in institutional investment flows” and have since attracted over $150 billion in assets. BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK dominated that first wave, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) becoming the third-largest ETF by inflows in 2024—trailing only broad S&P 500 index funds and accumulating over $50 billion in assets in less than a year. By late 2025, the landscape will have exploded into what Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas describes as an impending reality where there will be “more crypto ETF filings than stocks.” Over 92 cryptocurrency ETF applications now await SEC review, covering everything from single-asset Solana and XRP funds to multi-crypto index products, staking-enabled ETFs, and even proposals for memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. (sigh) Price’s filing, which Balchunas called a “semi-shock” from a “top 5 active manager,” sits frozen with dozens of others during a federal government shutdown that has left the SEC with skeleton staffing and no clear timeline for approvals. Yet Price’s approach differs fundamentally from the herd. While most applications target passive index tracking or single-coin exposure, Price is proposing an actively managed multi-asset fund (holding 5-15 cryptocurrencies) that applies its core competency – fundamental research, valuation analysis, and active portfolio management – to the crypto space. This isn’t about being first to market. It’s about being right. “If you don’t start out as a crypto skeptic, there’s something wrong with you,” writes Blue Macellari, T Rowe Price’s head of digital assets, in one of three recent research papers on cryptocurrencies the firm shared with us. It’s a revealing admission that captures Price’s approach: start with skepticism, follow the data, and let the conclusions emerge. Price hired Macellari, a former crypto hedge fund executive, in 2022, not to chase trends but to build genuine expertise. The firm has spent years “monitoring developments in the digital assets space closely and developing the ability to trade digital assets,” according to company statements. Those conclusions, detailed in research by Justin Thomson (Head of the T Rowe Price Investment Institute) and Stefan Hubrich (Head of Global Multi-Asset Research), suggest that digital assets have reached an inflection point. They’re not just speculative toys anymore; they’re potentially evolving into a legitimate asset class. The key insight: while Bitcoin has endured four drawdowns exceeding 70%, each near-death experience has been followed by stronger recoveries. Despite extreme volatility (daily price swings of 5-10% remain common), the asset class refuses to disappear. More importantly, Price’s analysts have identified a potential path from “risk-on” to “risk-off” status for digital assets. If volatility dampens and cryptocurrencies decorrelate from other risk assets like high-growth equities, they could transition from speculative investments to mainstream portfolio components. For a firm built on fundamental analysis, cryptocurrencies posed a unique problem: how do you value an asset with no cash flows, no earnings, and no balance sheet? T Rowe Price analyst David Kroger addressed this by adapting traditional discounted cash flow frameworks, using staking rewards as a substitute for cash flow in the valuation process. The methodology acknowledges that cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks with different consensus mechanisms; Bitcoin uses energy-intensive “proof of work” mining, while Ethereum employs “proof of stake” validation. (No, I have no clue what those phrases mean.) The critical distinction: unlike gold (another non-cash-generating asset), Bitcoin is actually used for real-world transactions. With Bitcoin’s programmatically fixed supply of 21 million tokens, growth in transaction volume measured in USD necessitates a rising price for Bitcoin. This creates a potential return framework if Bitcoin transaction volumes grow alongside the broader economy. Over the 12 months ended August 2024, more than $1.3 billion in fees were expended on the Bitcoin network to support a total transaction volume of $2.4 trillion, demonstrating real economic utility. The crypto ETF filing comes at a pivotal moment for T Rowe Price. Like many active managers, the firm has faced persistent outflows as investors gravitate toward lower-cost passive strategies. The firm manages $1.77 trillion in assets but has been “seeking to diversify into new areas,” according to industry analysts. In response, Price has launched 24 ETFs in recent years—a dramatic expansion for a firm historically focused on mutual funds. Last month, it announced a partnership with Goldman Sachs to develop new private market products for retail investors. The Active Crypto ETF represents both a continuation of this ETF strategy and something more: evidence that Price’s research apparatus sees genuine opportunity in digital assets, not just a need to check a product box. As VettaFi’s Todd Rosenbluth noted, “It’s exciting to see them expand their ETF lineup beyond stock and bond exposure.” Price’s researchers acknowledge sympathy for the “digital gold” thesis: the view that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against financial collapse, similar to physical gold but with advantages like algorithmic scarcity rather than mere physical limits. But they’ve moved beyond that framework. Understanding value in crypto means “applying alternative notions of utility; it is a parallel world to ‘Trad-Fi,’ with a different lexicon,” Thomson writes. That lexicon includes concepts like decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and token burning, all of which create potential economic value flows. The comparison to gold is instructive but incomplete. Both Bitcoin and gold have scarcity value and bear a cost of carry since neither generates income. But Bitcoin’s algorithmic supply limit (the “halving” that occurs every four years until 2140, when the maximum 21 million tokens will exist) distinguishes it from paper currencies printed without theoretical limits. Thomson opens his research with a cautionary tale about a 1999 stock called Fyffes that jumped 40% in one day merely by announcing a virtual fruit market, then contrasts it with a 2024 crypto entrepreneur paying $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall before eating it in front of journalists. Both stories feature “a whiff of alchemy and transience—that wealth can be created and destroyed from fumes,” Thomson writes. Yet his conclusion is not to dismiss crypto but to separate “the ephemeral from the permanent, the froth from the substance, Ponzi from probity.” Price’s framework suggests that for digital assets to merit inclusion in diversified portfolios, they need an expectation of positive future returns, specifically, excess returns above cash that reward investors for accepting risk. Traditional assets like stocks (with equity risk premiums) and bonds (with duration premiums) have decades of data supporting this expectation. Digital assets have reached what Price calls the “gold stage.” They have economic value greater than zero. The next step is establishing a durable long-term return thesis beyond merely betting on continued adoption or financial collapse. The fact that Price is willing to file for a crypto ETF suggests its research team believes that thesis is taking shape. Hubrich’s analysis is particularly telling: “To formulate a long-term return thesis for digital assets (Das), investors will need to determine whether passive holders should expect to participate in the value added by the blockchain. The answer is likely to depend on the DA, so this analysis will need to be conducted on a case-by-case basis.” This is precisely the type of granular, security-by-security analysis that Price has applied to stocks and bonds for decades. Dominic Rizzo, who manages some of T Rowe Price’s ETFs, signaled the firm’s direction at an ETF conference earlier in 2025, noting that “now is a good time to consider bitcoin exposure” and comparing cryptocurrency pricing to commodities, saying it “closely tracks the cost of mining it.” These weren’t off-the-cuff remarks but deliberate signals from a firm that doesn’t speculate publicly. When the government shutdown ends and the SEC resumes processing applications, Price won’t be first out of the gate. But if the firm’s research proves prescient, the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF could establish the standard for how thoughtful, non-speculative institutional investors approach digital assets by applying rigorous fundamental analysis to select among cryptocurrencies based on network usage, staking rewards, adoption trends, and value creation. For a firm that has navigated the Great Depression, multiple wars, the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis, and countless market cycles, launching a crypto ETF is not a panic move or a desperate grab for assets. It’s a calculated decision backed by years of research and a belief that digital assets are evolving into something durable. As software engineer Jameson Lopp observes in Thomson’s research: “First step to understanding crypto: admitting you don’t understand crypto. Final step: realizing that ‘understanding’ is a moving target.” For T Rowe Price, that journey from skepticism to cautious embrace reflects the same discipline that has defined the firm for nearly nine decades. The research led somewhere uncomfortable, somewhere new, somewhere volatile—and Price followed. Whether that decision proves prescient or premature won’t be known for years. But it demonstrates that even the most conservative firms must evolve when the research is clear. Sometimes the most characteristic move is the one that looks uncharacteristic.

Title: Consumer sentiment is sinking across the board — except for Americans with the most stocks

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The ongoing government shutdown has helped push confidence to near-record lows, but one segment of the population is actually feeling more optimistic. The initial reading for the University of Michigan’s sentiment index fell to 50.3 in November from 53.6 last month, almost matching the all-time low of 50 from June 2022, when the annual rate of inflation hit its post-pandemic high. “With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a statement Friday. The decline was widespread and was seen across different age groups, income brackets, and political affiliations, she added. But not everyone followed that trend. “One key exception: consumers with the largest tercile of stock holdings posted a notable 11% increase in sentiment, supported by continued strength in stock markets,” Hsu said. The survey closed before Tuesday’s elections, which revealed continued voter discontent about affordability as food and energy prices creep higher. The timing is also notable given that it didn’t capture the most recent stock market selloff that sent the Nasdaq to its worst weekly loss since April’s trade war chaos. That came as investors grew more concerned about the AI boom looking like a bubble that could pop soon. Until this past week, the stock market was on a hot streak, notching fresh record high after record high, with the S&P 500 even closing in on the 7,000 milestone. The market’s impact on consumer sentiment comes as stock ownership has broadened over past five years into more income and age groups. A separate University of Michigan report from last month said the increase in market participation has been especially large among lower-income consumers, while participation rates of younger and older consumers have caught up with middle-aged consumers. In fact, a survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are now retail investors in the capital markets. And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years. Stock ownership has highlighted a divergence in consumer sentiment in recent months: investors are turning more upbeat while non-investors have turned more pessimistic, according to University of Michigan data from October. And participants with the top 20% of stock holdings are especially optimistic. The spilt even mirrors the K-shaped economy that has emerged as higher-income Americans continue to spend and prop up overall consumption, while others have pulled back. Meanwhile, the so-called wealth effect of higher asset prices on consumer spending has become more potent in the last 15 years, making it harder to separate the stock market from the economy. Today, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010, according to Oxford Economics. The University of Michigan pointed out in October that sentiment among stock market participants had been on the rise since May—after tumbling in April when President Donald Trump shocked global markets with his “Liberation Day” tariffs. By contrast, sentiment for non-stockholders continued to decline and had already hit post-pandemic lows. “These patterns are consistent with the fact that strong asset values support consumer sentimentonly for those who own those assets,” the report said. “Meanwhile, given that wealthier, higher-income consumers generate a disproportionate share of aggregate spending, the recent uptick in sentiment among these households may may help buoy consumption spending even amid views of the economy that are relatively subdued from a historical perspective.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Refining My Conservative Retirement Target Portfolio

Using historical data on funds to make assumptions about future performance involves correctly interpreting the trends. Over the past six years, the U.S. has experienced an extraordinarily unusual period: During the next six years, we will probably experience another bear market and modest to moderate inflation. Interest rates are likely to continue falling in the short-term, but not as low as the decade following the financial crisis because of less Quantitative Easing and higher deficits and national debt. High valuations are a headwind to equity returns, and high interest rates are a tailwind for bond returns. In January 2020, before the start of the COVID bar market, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 was an elevated 26 and is currently 31. I believe that the full COVID Cycle from January 2020 to December 2021 and 2025 are more representative of market conditions for the next six years than the period from January 2022 to December 2024. In this article, I explore how alternative investments and mixed asset funds with flexible strategies can be used to develop a conservative portfolio. To evaluate funds, I selected thirty-six funds in twenty-three different Lipper Categories that had good risk-adjusted performance during the full COVID cycle and 2025. I created an optimizer using Excel Solver to maximize the Martin Ratio for the full COVID cycle with constraints for portfolio concentration, minimum returns, drawdowns, yields, allocation to “junk bonds”, and consistency across the individual years and bear markets. Figure #1 shows the performance during the past four bear markets by allocation to stocks for all of the 461 mixed asset funds in the Lipper global dataset with at least six years of history. Note that the severity of the bear market has a larger impact on the portfolio performance than the of the stock to bond ratio. The two black dashed lines show a range of likely maximum downturns for the three bear markets, excluding the dotcom bear market, which was associated with a mild recession. The three maroon squares are the maximum drawdowns of the “Conservative” and “Moderate” portfolios that I created and the target portfolio that I described last month in Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control. The two portfolios created for this article had low to average drawdowns. Figure #1: Mixed Asset Fund Drawdowns During Four Bear Markets Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #1 shows the average annualized returns over the past six years for the mixed asset funds and the “Conservative”, “Moderate”, and original target portfolio. The two new portfolios outperformed both the mixed asset funds and the original target portfolio. Table #1: Mixed Asset Fund Returns for Past Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I am currently reading “A Crash Course on Crises: Macroeconomic Concepts for Run-Ups, Collapses, and Recoveries” by Princeton University economics professor Markus K. Brunnermeier and London School of Economics professor Ricardo Reis, which researches the interrelationship between financial markets and the economy during a crisis. They describe part of their audience to be “members of the informed public wanting to absorb some of the concepts that should be guiding both macroeconomic and financial policy.” The book contains some wonderful insights into investing behavior, such as “Why don’t other, more sophisticated investors, lean against the bubble, preventing it from arising in the first place?” They continue, “These investors try to forecast how long the bubble will persist, which is governed by the trading behavior of the other (sophisticated) investors.” I have no illusions that I can predict the behavior of other sophisticated investors. As described by Hyman Minsky, many crises are preceded by some type of innovation (such as artificial intelligence) followed by long periods of price increases, speculation, and leverage. These are followed by a period of instability and traders becoming risk-averse and de-leveraging. Stock market price-to-earnings ratios were around 18 before the 1929 stock market crash, peaked at 34 prior to the bursting of the dotcom bubble, hit 21 prior to the start of the financial crisis, and are now at an elevated 31. There are usually “triggering events” that set off chain reactions between asset markets and financial markets that determine the severity of corrections and whether a macro-financial crisis results. At the National Association for Business Economics, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, “When COVID-19 struck in March 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up, threatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic downturn.” The stage is set for a correction, and there are plenty of potential “triggering events” such as a slowing economy, rising inflation, potential supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical risk. Figure #2 represents the investing environment for the past six years. Fiscal and monetary stimulus contained the economic fallout from the COVID bear market lasting from January 2020 through March of that year, but Personal Consumption Price inflation rose from a half percent following the COVID bear market to nearly seven percent by January 2022. Charles Boccadoro described The Great Normalization (TGN) in which interest rates normalized to higher rates, hurting bond performance. The TGN bear market lasted from January 2022 to September of that year. By December 2023, the price-to-earnings ratio had crossed the high valuation level of $25 per dollar of earnings. The debasement trade is partly the result of investors and global central banks buying gold and the increased acceptance of cryptocurrency. I believe that the dollar will weaken but not be replaced as the global reserve currency, and the debasement trade is overbought. Figure #2: The COVID and Great Normalization Full Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The full COVID Cycle was from January 2020 to December 2021 and includes the COVID bear market and inflation. I expect cycles of bear markets and inflation to be more frequent in the coming decade than in the decade following the financial crisis. Rates are high, so “The Great Normalization” of rising rates is unlikely to occur to such extremes for many years. Finally, valuations are currently high and more likely to fall than rise either over time or in a correction with a “triggering event”. I set up my Excel optimizer for both the Conservative and Moderate portfolios to maximize the Martin Ratio for the January 2020 to December 2021 period by changing allocations to 36 funds with constraints that I wanted to have drawdowns of less than nine percent for both the COVID and TGN bear markets. Maximum allocations were set for Alternative, Bond, Equity, and Mixed Asset fund types to ensure diversification. The Conservative portfolio has additional constraints of having yields at least 4% with less than 13% allocated to lower quality “junk bonds”. Figure #3 contains the inflation-adjusted results from Portfolio Visualizer assuming 4% annual withdrawals for the Conservative, Moderate, and Original Target Portfolio compared to the Fidelity Asset Manager 40% (FFANX), which is a good global mixed asset fund. The link is provided here. The Conservative and Moderate portfolios had similar returns through 2023, with the Moderate portfolio having higher volatility. Both beat inflation over the six years after adjusting for withdrawals. During the period of rising valuations and the debasement trade, the Moderate Portfolio has outperformed. Both outperformed the Original Target Portfolio from my last article because of a wider selection of funds under consideration, improvements in methodology, and an increase in the maximum allocation for a fund from 10% to 15%. All three outperformed the 40/60 baseline fund, which was negatively impacted during the rising rates period. Figure #3: Conservative and Moderate Portfolio Growth – Six Years Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #2 contains the resulting allocations with the funds sorted from the lowest Ulcer Ratio over the past six years to the highest. I own shares in FPFIX/FFIRX, PCBAX, PMAIX, PZRMX, and AVALX. It will take a couple of years to fill out the rest of the portfolio, depending upon cash flows, and I will lean towards the less risky funds next. Table #2: Portfolio Allocations Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #3 contains the portfolio metrics for the period May 2019 to September 2025 from Portfolio Visualizer. Annualized returns are after withdrawals, while Time-Weighted Rate of Return reflects investment performance. Table #3: Portfolio Performance Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #4 contains the metrics and ratings from MFO for the funds for the past six years. They are sorted from the lowest Ulcer Index, which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns from the lowest to the highest. MFO Risk is based on the Ulcer Index comparing all funds, while the Ulcer Rating is for funds within the same category peers. Martin Ratio is the risk-free return divided by the Ulcer Index. The MFO Rating is based on the Martin Ratio for funds within the same Lipper Category. The Batting Average Rating (BA) is based on the percentage of the months that a fund beat its peers. One takeaway is that some of the funds outperformed during down markets but lagged peers overall. Table #4: Fund Metrix – Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Optimization depends on having funds with low correlations to each other. Notice that some funds had their maximum drawdowns during the COVID (2020) bear market, and some had them during the Great Normalization (2022) bear market. Table #5 shows how the funds performed in each of the bear markets and the bull markets. The lower-risk funds provide some safety during downturns, while the riskier funds provide growth potential. Blue shaded cells indicate the best performers, and red are the worst performers.

Columbia Thermostat bases its stock to bond allocation on valuations. During the financial crisis, the strategy was to invest in all stocks or bonds, and it did not perform well. It has improved its strategy to have a range of allocations depending on price levels and performed well during the COVID bear market. The Fact Sheet indicates that the fund is currently 70% invested in fixed income and 30% invested in equity. It contains the allocation to stocks by the S&P 500 level. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PBAIX, PCBAX) is an Alternative Global Macro fund that has performed well since the 2008 financial crisis, but during the financial crisis fell nearly 27% in 2008 and returned 26% in 2009. I own shares in PCBAX, but limit allocations to alternatives because they use derivatives, which can be less predictable during a crisis. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) is another good Alternative Global Macro fund that had a maximum drawdown of 7% during the financial crisis. I included it in the original target portfolio from last month. The Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) is based on the concepts developed by Harry Browne in the 1980s to provide steady, long-term growth with low volatility without trying to time the market. The fund managers describe Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) as, “Designed as a core portfolio holding, Permanent Portfolio seeks to preserve and increase the purchasing power value of each shareholder’s account over the long-term, regardless of current or future market conditions, through strategic investments in a broad array of different asset classes.” It invests fixed percentages of its net assets in dollar assets (35%), gold (20%), aggressive growth stocks (15%), real estate and natural resource stocks (15%), Swiss Franc assets (10%), and silver (5%). The PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) is described by the fund managers as “By investing in a blend of inflation-related asset classes, the fund seeks to help preserve and grow purchasing power, enhance portfolio diversification, and guard against market shocks across varying inflation environments.” It currently has a composition of Inflation Linked Bonds 68%), Commodities (22%), Currencies (15%), REITS (10%), and Precious Metals (10%). I own shares in PZRMX. Figure #4 contains some of the funds that did well during 2020 to 2022 with high inflation. These are mostly in the Flexible Portfolio Lipper Category plus DIVO in equity income, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX, maroon line) in the Alternative Global Macro category, and the PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX, red line) in the Flexible Portfolio Category. During the period in between the bear markets, the S&P 500 rose 89% while core bonds rose a paltry 2.5%. Figure #4: Fund Performance During Inflation (2020 – 2022) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset and St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. From 2012 through 2019, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) had very similar performance. From 2019 through 2021, PRPFX outperformed PZRMX and greatly outperformed starting in 2023. I prefer owning PRPFX and PZRMX to directly owning gold because it is much more volatile. Over the past year, I decreased my allocation to stock from 65% to 50% which is a small decrease in risk. Rebalancing during high market valuations and downturns is a modest way of “buying low and selling high”. I believe that risk risk-adjusted performance of bonds to be greater than equities for the next few years. Using the bucket approach to match risk assets with spending needs and using bond ladders does more to reduce portfolio risk than lowering the allocation to stocks. As a qualifier, I use financial advisors to manage the majority of my portfolio using a traditional, globally diversified 60/40 portfolio. I am developing this “Conservative Portfolio” strategy for a subset of the portfolio that I manage in addition to traditional bond funds and bond ladders to have liquidity available in any market condition, and with some growth potential.

Welcome to the casino! GraniteShares 3x Short AMD Daily ETP, a product marketed for European investors, recently pulled off the rare feat of going to zero. The fund, purely a speculator’s trading vehicle, was designed to rise by 3% for every 1% that AMD stock fell. Perfect opp for experienced sharks to dart in, tear off a chunk of carcass, and get out before anything bad can happen. Think of a holding time that might be measured in seconds, and you’re there. The fund imploded when AMD announced a deal with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure. AMD’s stock surged up 37% before the market even opened. In consequence, the fund was structured to fall by more than 100% leading to an “index cancellation redemption event.” Alternatively, it is a good reminder that in a casino, the house always wins. Akre Focus Fund completed its reorganization into the Akre Focus ETF effective October 27th. The reorganization will result in no changes to its investment objectives or fundamental investment approach. The ETF is expected to deliver the strategy in a more cost-effective, tax-efficient, and flexible format for shareholders. ARK Bitcoin Yield ETF is in registration. Catherine D. Wood and William Scherer will oversee the daily operations of the ETF. Expenses have not been stated. BBH Select Series Large Cap and Mid Cap funds will be reorganized into related ETFs. Existing fund shareholders will be shareholders of the ETFs before the commencement of trading on November 17th. BBH touts the ability to trade intraday, portfolio transparency, and potentially lower expenses and tax bills as reasons for considering the ETFs. The reorganization will be a tax-free event. The case for the fund, beyond that, is open to question. Each fund has about half a billion in assets and, by Morningstar’s measure, offers low relative risk but below-average returns. As measured by the Sharpe ratio, the funds are not compelling; each is below its benchmark and category over the past three years, with managers who have been on board for about four (Large Cap) and two years (Mid Cap). Dimensional Funds Advisors has filed a registration statement for its first ETF share class of funds since Vanguard’s patent expired in 2023. The 13 incipient ETFs are: U.S. Large Company, U.S. Large Cap Equity, U.S. Small Cap Value, U.S. Targeted Value, U.S. Core Equity 1, U.S. Core Equity 2, U.S. Vector Equity, U.S. Small Cap, U.S. Micro Cap, U.S. High Relative Profitability, DFA Real Estate Securities, U.S. Large Cap Growth, U.S. Small Cap Growth ETF The SEC has stated that it is going to issue an order allowing the firm to have this type of structure. JP Morgan has completed its reorganization of its JP Morgan National Municipal Income Fund into the JP Morgan Municipal ETF effective October 27, 2025. Lazard Emerging Markets Core Equity Portfolio Fund was converted into the Lazard Emerging Markets Opportunities ETF on October 27, 2025. Pabrai Wagons ETF is in registration. Mohnish Pabrai will be the portfolio manager; expenses have not been stated. Our colleague, Devesh Shah, profiled the estimable Mr. Pabrai and the open-end fund version in “The Pabrai Fund Overview and Interview with Mohnish Pabrai” (10/2024). Top 20% among global small- to mid-caps in 2024, bottom 10% YTD in 2025, much smaller and cheaper stocks than its peers, fully invested. Thrivent Core Small Cap Value fund will be converted into an ETF, pending receipt of shareholder approval, on November 21, 2025. Vanguard launched the Vanguard Emerging Markets ex-China ETF (VEXC). The portfolio managers for VEXC will be Michael Perre, Jeffrey Miller, and John Kraynak, CFA. The ETF will launch with an expected expense ratio of 0.07%. The ETF will offer exposure to emerging markets equities while excluding securities classified by FTSE as being based in China. American Century Small Cap Value fund will reopen to new investors on December 9th. It has been closed since August 2021. Effective December 1, 2025, Clearbridge Small Cap Growth Fund will reopen to purchases (and incoming exchanges!) from new investors. Wasatch International Small Cap Value and Global Small Cap Value funds began to be offered to investors on October 1. Effective as of December 8, 2025, the AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund becomes the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, (ii) make changes to its principal investment strategies and principal risks, (iii) changes from “non‑diversified” to “diversified”, (iv) replaces the S&P 500 Growth Index, one of its benchmark indices, with the Russell 2000 Growth Index and (v) gets a new management team. Other than that, all quiet. Effective October 29, 2025, the CCM Global Equity ETF (CCMG) became the Sequoia Global Value ETF (SFGV). The fund launched in January 2024, modestly trails its peers and benchmark … and has drawn a billion in assets. Curious. The Frontier MFG Core Infrastructure Fund was renamed the MFG Core Infrastructure Fund on October 31, 2025. On or about December 15, 2025, the Gabelli Automation ETF will change to the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. Given that the fund has accumulated a tepid record and under $7 million AUM in nearly four years, I wouldn’t be rushing in. On April 21, 2025, Macquarie Group Limited, the parent company of Delaware Investments Funds Advisers, announced that it had entered into an agreement for Nomura Holding America Inc. to acquire Macquarie Asset Management’s US and European public investments business. The transaction closed on November 1, 2025. One consequence is that Macquarie funds will pick up the Nomura name. Should the Board approve these name changes, they would become effective as of May 1, 2026. On or around December 19, 2025, the Rayliant Quantamental Emerging Market ex-China Equity ETF will be succeeded by the Rayliant Wilshire NxtGen Emerging Markets Equity ETF. Among the … uhh, tweaks, accompanying the name change: “the Fund will transition from an actively-managed exchange-traded fund that invests primarily in equity securities of companies in emerging markets, excluding China, to a passively-managed ETF that seeks to track the performance of a machine learning-driven index that includes equity securities of companies in emerging markets, including China.” Quick heads up for shoppers: no need to buy Christmas presents for the Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, which will endure no more as of Christmas Eve, 2025. ATAC US Rotation ETF departed on October 24, 2025. That’s separate from the older, more successful ATAC Rotation Fund, which remains. The ETF has $4 million, and the fund has about $50 million. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF will be liquidated on December 15, 2025. Apparently, the Fidelity Digital Health ETF has declared digitally terminal and is expected to liquidate on or about November 20, 2025. Fidelity SAI Municipal Bond Index Fund is expected to liquidate on or about November 12, 2025. On October 16, 2025, the Board of Trustees of Fidelity Merrimack Street Trust approved the liquidation of the Fidelity Sustainable Core Plus Bond ETF on or about November 20, 2025. The flames died out for the FIRE Funds Wealth Builder ETF and FIRE Funds™ Income Target ETF on October 30, 2025. The Guardian Capital Fundamental Global Equity Fund and the Alta Quality Growth Fund will be liquidating their assets at the close of business on December 3, 2025. Humankind US Stock ETF will be liquidated on or about December 8, 2025. LeaderShares Activist Leaders ETF and LeaderShares Equity Skew ETF joined the ranks of former funds on October 30, 2025. Otter Creek Long/Short Opportunity fund and the Otter Creek Focus Strategy ETF will be liquidated on October 30th. Keith Long was one of the portfolio managers and the founder of Otter Creek Management until he passed away in August 2023. The Rayliant Quantamental China Equity ETF will be liquidated on December 5, 2025. The Saratoga Funds, Energy & Basic Materials Portfolio, the Financial Services Portfolio, and the Municipal Bond Portfolio will be liquidated on December 17, 2025. Sterling Capital Focus Equity ETF won’t be making it to Thanksgiving this year; the fund is slated to liquidate, terminate, evaporate, and eviscerate on November 24, 2025. Thrivent Core Low Volatility Equity Fund and Thrivent Core Mid Cap Value Fund ceased their thriving on October 22, 2025. Victory High Income Municipal Bond Fund will have its final opportunity to declare victory on or about December 22, 2025. Thereafter, it will be a former fund. The Shadow here!

Title: Microsoft Has Reportedly Developed “Toolkits” to Break NVIDIA’s CUDA Dominance, Slashing Inference Costs with AMD AI GPUs
URL: https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-developed-toolkits-to-break-nvidia-cuda-dominance/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T15:44:28Z
Full Content:
Microsoft is exploring ways to leverage the 'stack' of its AMD GPUs for inferencing workloads, as the company develops toolkits that convert NVIDIA CUDA models into ROCm-supported code. One of the reasons NVIDIA has managed to retain its dominance in the AI space is that the firm has a robust CUDA software ecosystem in place, which its competitors, such as AMD, cannot currently rival. Efforts have been made to allow cross-platform support of software stacks, but we haven't seen a solution that has become mainstream. However, according to a 'high-ranking' Microsoft employee, it is reported that the tech giant has developed 'toolkits' that allow the firm to run CUDA code on AMD GPUs by translating it into a ROCm-compatible version. Breaking CUDA's dominance isn't an easy task, as the software ecosystem is so integral to the AI industry that its adoption is almost ubiquitous, even in nations like China. However, Microsoft's toolkit, mentioned by the employee, likely employs a route that has been in the market for quite some time. One way to perform a CUDA-to-ROCm translation is through a runtime compatibility layer, which enables CUDA API calls to be translated into ROCm without requiring complete source code rewrites. One example of this is the ZLUDA tool, which intercepts CUDA calls, translates them into ROCm, and does so without requiring a full recompile. We built some toolkits to help convert like CUDA models to ROCm so you could use it on an AMD, like a 300X. We have had a lot of inquiries about what is our path with AMD, the 400X and the 450X. We're actually working with AMD on that to see what we can do to maximize that. However, due to ROCm still being a relatively 'immature' software stack, there are several API calls or pieces of code in CUDA that have no mapping with AMD's software, which, in some cases, collapses the performance, which is a high-risk problem in large datacenter environments. Another possible variant of the toolkit being mentioned here is likely an end-to-end cloud migration tool that integrates with Azure, targeting both AMD and NVIDIA instances. Of course, this does bring problems when conversions happen on a large scale, but by the looks of it, the toolkits developed by Microsoft appear to be in confined use. Now, the reason why Microsoft is pursuing the 'software conversions' here is simply because the firm is seeing an increase in inference workloads, and the company is looking for a more cost-effective workload, which is why AMD's AI chips make sense here, since they are the only counterpart to the 'pricey' NVIDIA GPUs. And since you cannot leave out CUDA models across inference environments, the translation from it to ROCm becomes the next big step for Microsoft.

Title: Why Sam Altman Won't Be on the Hook for OpenAI's Spending Spree
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2025/11/07/why-sam-altman-wont-be-on-the-hook-for-openais-massive-spending-spree/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T14:33:00Z
Full Content:
Over the last few months, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been on a tear of dealmaking, announcing multibillion dollar agreements with the biggest tech companies in the world. There’s Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft, AMD, Broadcom, and most recently, Amazon. He’s committed to spending a grand sum total of $1.4 trillion on datacenters in the coming years — an eyebrow-raising figure for a company which claims its annual revenue is projected to reach $20 billion this year, begging an all-important question for the entire tech industry, whose fate is now tied to OpenAI: What happens if he can’t pay? At an event this week, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar seemed to suggest that the government could act as a “backstop” for the company’s commitments — comments she later walked back. And in a long-winded post on X, Altman addressed the question of what happens to OpenAI if its web of deals falls apart: “If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,” Altman said. “...We of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.” The odds don’t look great right now. In order to come through on its compute commitments, OpenAI’s revenue would have to grow to an estimated $577 billion by 2029, roughly the size of Google’s revenue that same year, Tomasz Tunguz, a general partner at Theory Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post. That’s a roughly 2900% jump from its current projections for 2025. But OpenAI has options. One likely scenario is that the AI company pays for and utilizes only a portion of the compute it has booked, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. In that case, companies like Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, CoreWeave and others will most likely renegotiate the contracts and ensure they get at least some amount of business from OpenAI, especially if the alternative is getting none at all. “They don't want OpenAI to go bankrupt, so their incentive is to renegotiate,” he told Forbes. “He’s taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” Renegotiating contracts isn’t uncommon in the data center world. These contracts are extremely complex and often spread out over a span of years; some parties can even further extend timelines in case companies aren’t able to meet commitments. Clients like OpenAI are typically billed on the basis of usage. The “big numbers” being announced are often larger than what’s actually committed under contract, largely due to variables like share price, data center construction cost and GPU price, data center expert Daniel Golding said. For instance, OpenAI has committed to buy up to 6 GW of AMD’s chips (estimated to be worth around $90 billion) in exchange for about 10% of AMD shares—no cash on either side. But that hinges on performance milestones for OpenAI’s technology and commercial business as well as AMD’s share price. The contracts often have some capital I ifs. Thanks to constraints on power supply and chip availability, there’s a possibility that some of these infrastructure providers aren’t able to deliver in time, another opportunity for OpenAI to weasel out of paying some of the top line number. OpenAI’s $22.4 billion in total contracts with CoreWeave, for instance, can be terminated by either party at any time “for cause” (legal speak for things like delays). But even with about a trillion dollars on the line, the bigger risk in Altman’s mind is not having access to enough cheap compute to train and run better AI models when the time comes— a move that is crucial for revenue growth. “We believe the risk to OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much,” he said, adding that the company is also exploring ways to sell compute to other companies directly, much like CoreWeave does. When reached for comment, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe said the company has “nothing to add.” Altman’s fixation on grabbing as much gargantuan compute as he can is not surprising. He has always knelt at the altar of scaling laws. Earlier this year, Altman mused on the coming of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, the company’s overarching goal of creating AI that matches or surpasses human capabilities. “The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it,” he wrote, noting you could get “continuous and predictable gains” from pumping money into those resources. “The scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude,” he wrote. Even before ChatGPT was released, he told employees at his crypto-cum-identity company Worldcoin (now called World), that one of his personal operating principles is “scale it up and see what happens,” something he’s found effective with everything from large neural networks to fusion reactors, Forbes reported. And the faster the better. Scaling up “earlier than it makes sense to … is super, super valuable,” he told Worldcoin employees. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them.’” Experts note chief dealmaker Altman doesn’t have anything to lose. He has repeatedly claimed he does not have a stake in the company, and won’t have a stake even after OpenAI has restructured to become a public benefit corporation. “He has the upside, in a sense, in terms of influence, if it all succeeds,” said Ofer Eldar, a corporate governance professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. “He's taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” That’s not good corporate governance, according to Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. “We allow leaders that we see as being super pioneering to behave idiosyncratically, and when things move in the opposite direction and somebody has to pay, it's unclear that they're the ones that are going to have to pay,” she said. Luria adds: “He can commit to as much as he wants. He can commit to a trillion dollars, ten trillion, a hundred trillion dollars. It doesn't matter. Either he uses it, he renegotiates it, or he walks away.” There are of course more indirect stakes for Altman, experts said, like the reputational blow he’d take if the deals fall apart. But on paper, he’d seemingly be off the hook, they said. As OpenAI has grown in prominence, tech giants have clamored to strike deals with the AI behemoth. “More of the world wants to work with us, so deals are quicker to negotiate,” Altman said recently. And they’ve reaped the upsides: Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom gained a collective $636 billion in market cap on the days their deals were announced. Most recently, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion AI infrastructure deal with Amazon on Monday, the company’s stock increased 4%, adding $10 billion to Jeff Bezos’ net worth. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them,’” Luria said. Companies involved in these circular deals have already indicated they’re willing to bail each other out. In September, Nvidia said it would buy CoreWeave’s unsold computing capacity through 2032, initially worth $6.3 billion. Presumably, that could expand to include anything OpenAI doesn’t use given that it’s CoreWeave’s largest customer. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank,” said Lloyd Walmsley, a Mizuho analyst who covers Meta, Google and Amazon. “ Everyone's holding hands and, and having this leap of faith that the products are so powerful.” It’s also possible that OpenAI uses all the compute it has booked, and needs more. In that case, the AI titan will need to raise more funding—either through private or public markets—and increase its revenue exponentially. Part of why Altman has spoken about a potential OpenAI IPO is that it would make raising cheaper debt much easier. Altman said on Thursday that he’s confident that revenue will continue to grow, primarily from upcoming enterprise products and categories like robotics and consumer devices. Then, take the extreme case. If OpenAI were to file for bankruptcy protection, who would get paid first? Who would, in Sam Altman’s words, “get burnt”? For one, it’s entirely possible that some cash-rich company, perhaps one on the other end of one of its big contracts like Microsoft or Oracle, buys it in a fire sale. In the very unlikely event OpenAI goes bankrupt and liquidates instead, debtholders would get their money back first. Then equity investors, and finally—if there’s anything left over—common shareholders. OpenAI has only announced one debt deal so far, a $4 billion credit facility with nine banks including JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The company announced the loan in October 2024 and said it is a revolving credit facility (akin to a giant corporate credit card). It’s unclear if OpenAI has additional debt, which it isn’t required to disclose as a private company. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.” King among OpenAI’s equity holders is Microsoft, which owns 27% of the company following OpenAI’s restructuring as a for-profit company last week. Microsoft has invested $11.6 billion of its $13 billion commitment to OpenAI, and OpenAI has committed to purchase $250 billion of Microsoft Azure’s compute services over the coming years. The companies have two-way plans to share revenue. “Of the dominoes that are going to fall when OpenAI can't pay everybody [and the question arises of] who gets paid first, and I'd argue that Microsoft gets paid first,” Luria added. Other large shareholders include Thrive, SoftBank, Dragoneer and investors in the $6 billion merger between Jony Ive’s io and OpenAI. Common shareholders—employees, cofounders and the nonprofit—would get what’s left, proportionally to how much they paid for their shares. Interestingly, OpenAI’s nonprofit holds a special “Class N” common share, which gives it majority voting and veto power in elections of board directors, though that share isn’t entitled to any financial return if the company were to go under. (The nonprofit’s 26% stake likely also includes ordinary common shares.) Altman’s wheeling and dealing is nothing short of mind-boggling, though many of the biggest payments aren’t due for a few years. In the AI universe, that’s plenty of time to figure out how he’s going to pay for it all, whether it’s additional fundraising or explosive revenue growth. Seems like nobody knows the answer just yet, not even him.

Title: SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite (Xbox, PC) headset review — At the apex of headset luxury

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a step above its competitors in every respect, including price. This monster $599 headset literally does it all. Simultaneous audio between two USB-C sources, 3.5mm, and Bluetooth, support for literally every gaming platform, premium materials, ANC, 30-hour swappable batteries, a desktop digital audio controller, and superb audio. The only issues amount to minor nitpicks, but you're going to need to really, REALLY want those extra features to justify that sky-high price tag. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is the best headset I've ever reviewed. Top shelf build quality and comfort Industry-leading device versatility Immaculate, peerless audio Retractable mic with ANC Handy DAC with great features Monster battery life Premium specs means premium price Software is a bit slow and could be improved Materials make it a fingerprint magnet Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. $599.99. That's how much the latest effort from SteelSeries will set you back. And it's a price tag that's impossible to overlook. This is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite. It joins other products that share the "Elite" branding, such as the Xbox Elite Controller, targeting users on the high end. Gamers span all sorts of purchasing power capabilities these days, and companies know it. For those with cash to burn, building products that can seemingly do everything while also sporting the most premium materials is a segment manufacturers are increasingly targeting. The Arctis Nova Elite unashamedly joins that market as the best Xbox headset for pure, decadent luxury. As a humble games blogger, I'm not sure there's a universe where I would (or even could) ever pay $599.99 for a headset, practically under any circumstances — but if I could afford it, it would absolutely be for this headset. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is undeniably the most luxurious gaming headset I have ever used, whose features and quality inarguably justify that sky-high price tag. But you're going to be a very specific type of gamer to want to buy in here. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by SteelSeries. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. For over a decade, I've been reviewing headsets of all shapes and sizes. I've tried earbuds, budget gaming headsets, and premium cans for enthusiasts. I keep all of the headsets I review for active comparisons, and could probably open my own headset store if this tech blogging lark ever folds. One thing that won't fold is my enthusiasm for recommending YOU the best Xbox and PC headsets for your use cases. As for this headset, I've also been using the previous Arctis Nova as my daily driver. How does this one compare? Read on. You know the price already. It's a beefy boy, but what about the specs to match it? Let's take a look. This is premium from every angle you look. This is a hi-res certified headset, which means it's verified by independent organizations as being able to deliver sound beyond a typical CD. This is 24-bit/96 kHz signals specifically, and to do that, requires a higher grade of engineering and materials. As far as I could tell, this is the first wireless gaming headset to achieve this standard — a level typically reserved for audiophile products and studio-grade gear. Category Arctis Nova Pro Elite Drivers 40mm carbon fiber drivers with brass surrounds Frequency response 10 Hz – 40 kHz (Hi-Res certified) Connectivity Dual USB-C, 2.4 GHz wireless, 3.5mm line-in, Bluetooth Microphone Retractable and beamforming internal retracted modes Battery system Dual hot-swappable batteries (30~ hours x2) Build materials Steel headband, aluminum hinges, premium leatherette cushions Weight ~350 g Compatibility PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox (via DAC), mobile (via Bluetooth) Special features Hi-Res Wireless certification, AI mic noise reduction, EQ software, ANC options, full DAC with multi-platform connectivity, simultaneous audio source mixing Price (RRP) $559.99 USD It's not all about hi-res certification here, though. While premium materials definitely had a role to play here, this headset also boasts some of the most impressive versatility we've ever seen in a gaming headset. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Arctis Nova Elite's powerful digital audio controller looks unassuming on your desk, but it boasts monstrous capabilities. It's your platform for hot-swapping and keeping batteries charged up (with each of the 2 included cells offering up to 30 hours of playback). It also lets you mix audio signals from four different sources: two USB-C, one 3.5mm line-in, and one Bluetooth 5.3. This is the first headset that has offered the ability to mix Xbox, PS5, and PC audio simultaneously since SPDIF fell out of fashion as a result — something game streamers using consoles and capture cards might appreciate. Even the packaging is premium here, as SteelSeries guns for the audiophile and enthusiast gamer segment. It's as expensive as some Xbox Series X and PS5 models at $599.99, and it seems to have good stock levels across the board as of writing. Does the Arctis Nova Elite stick the landing? Absolutely yes, in (almost) every regard. And luckily, the parts that could be improved are software in nature and can be updated. Here are more details on the experience. When I opened up the package to this headset, I immediately knew I was about to experience something special. This is by far and away the most expensive headset I have ever reviewed, and its premium presentation will immediately command your attention. The packaging is accented in gold and comes in a sort of monolithic box as if it had descended from another planet. The Arctis Nova Elite sports a familiar design if you've seen the predecessor Arctis Nova Pro (my previous primary driver here), complete with a retractable mic, detachable magnetic side-plates housing USB-C connectivity and the battery bay, as well as a floating headband. What sets it apart is that every aspect of it is dialled up to 11. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The dials, buttons, and materials all sport a very luxurious feel. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The leatherette earcups feel incredibly comfortable, and dare I say, dreamy on the skin, easily defeating fabric-clad rivals. The floating headband is also an easy win for long, long periods of use, and retains SteelSeries' tradition for cranial comfort. One weird downside of the floating headband is that it's easy to rock the headset off your head if you get a little too immersed in the music (and immersed you will, the sound delivery on this headset is immense). It's designed for long gaming sessions at the end of the day, but it's worth being aware of. Returning is the retractable boom microphone, which now cleverly has per-configuration settings. When you retract it, you can still use it for calls, and it'll beamform your voice similar to earbuds. When you extend it, it functions as a high-quality mic for comms and potentially even light content creation. I'm not sure I'd record a full YouTube video on this mic over my Elgato XLR, but it's up there with the best gaming headset mics I've used. Indeed, the ability to retract the mic and fall back to Bluetooth 5.3 gives you lifestyle usability here that many other "gaming" headsets don't really offer. The subtle design on the black model means it won't look out of place when used during commutes or on a plane, and there's even an alternative colorway that fits a more Apple-style grey fashion aesthetic, too. The only criticism I'd offer here from a "lifestyle" perspective is that, perhaps, the logos are a bit "loud" for this type of use case. There are after-market sideplates you can buy that look a little more subtle, though, or even louder ones if you prefer. The World of Warcraft Horde ones are out of stock, though (dang.) Also, the soft-touch plastics SteelSeries opted for here tend to be fingerprint magnets too, which isn't a big deal, but on the black model, it can be pretty noticeable. When you're knee deep in corpses in a Battlefield 6 map or rocking to Nirvana while writing a gaming headset review on the internet (meta), you're likely not thinking about the side plates or fingerprints, though. How's the audio? It's fan-expletive-tastic. Let's not beat around the bush here. The Arctis Nova Elite is the most immaculate audio experience I've had in over a decade of gaming headset reviews. I put them directly head-to-head with a family member's studio-grade Beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO and was quite stunned to find the experience pleasantly comparable. This is a gaming headset, but I've found myself using it primarily for music over the past few weeks. Rediscovering new details in soundscapes I know very well has been incredibly fun with this product, as someone who generally uses earbuds or other random gaming headsets for music typically. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. There's no distortion, no glitching, no artifacting, no muddiness, no range is overbearing or under-represented — it's simply hard to go back to anything else after using these. ANC helps eliminate background noise on planes, trains, and buses, and easy on-ear controls and a solid mobile app make them a winner for commuters. Indeed, you have multiple ways to connect to this headset, too. As noted, the digital audio controller will sit at your desk and politely allow you to connect up not one, but actually three sound sources, on top of a fourth Bluetooth signal directly into the headset. And yes, you can mix them all simultaneously. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. The vast majority of users won't need this, but as a game streamer that uses a laptop and an Xbox with a capture card, I've found it incredibly welcome to not need to Bluetooth to my TV to get game audio (but you can still do that if you want?!). The headset is heavily configurable, too. The Steelseries GG software on PC and mobile devices allows you to load up from a huge array of presets for various games, more so than any other headset I've tried. Even obscure games are represented here, which is impressive. The only downside is that you can't really delete any of the presets, nor favorite the ones you prefer. It can be a pain going back and forward between a gaming preset and a music preset, for example — but it's easily fixable. The software on PC in general could use a variety of improvements, as it sometimes hangs and features app downloads and things most people are doubtlessly unlikely to use (why would I need to download Discord from SteelSeries?). But, this is quite honestly my only gripe with the feature set, and thankfully, software is a comparably easy fix over a hardware flaw. This headset has no hardware flaws. The first iteration of the Arctis Nova Pro had a protrusion in the left ear that could get uncomfortable across long sessions, for example, but there's no such issue here. Maximum comfort, with maximum longevity, and superb, immaculate audio. For gaming, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite continues to excel. Games like Battlefield 6 and Overwatch absolutely sing on this device, giving away enemy positions with powerful tactical awareness, all without detracting from the more immersive sound design of the various virtual warzones we inhabit. The amount of tweaking you can do is impressive, too. Pushed to its extremes, the bass can get obnoxiously punchy if you want it to, or leave it thick and creamy, all while retaining maximum clarity and separation. Instruments sound like real instruments on this headset, which might sound like an odd thing to say — but you really feel the physicality of a kick drum or the slide of a bass string in this soundscape. Imagine how that translates to games with high-quality audio design, with explosions and gunfire zipping all around you. It's difficult to compare this to other gaming headsets as a result. The Arctis Nova Elite is just sublime. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The microphone experience is good, too. As you can hear in the clip above, you're looking at crystal clear comms with the microphone extended, and very good call quality when it's retracted. You can set per-config sidetone too. The sidetone quality isn't the best, but it's more than adequate for game comms. All up, it's hard to find things to gripe about here. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The number of settings you can alter and control is intuitive to set up and access, even if the software itself can be a bit slow at times. And hey, it can (and will) be updated. This headset is an absolute winner, but ... it's hard to look past that price point. There's pretty much no other headset that competes with the Arctis Nova Elite. On pure audio alone, the Arctis Nova Elite stands out in its own class and is more closely comparable to other hi-res headsets that typically don't fall into the gaming category. The only other headset with this kind of wireless versatility is the Astro A50 (2025), and the Arctis Nova Elite has it utterly beaten on raw audio, comfort, and lifestyle versatility. The Astro A50 is a pure gaming headset, though, and shaves $300 off the asking price to boot. I think, unless you were planning to use this headset everywhere and anywhere as a lifestyle option, you might get more bang for your buck with the similarly versatile Astro A50 ... but you wouldn't get the sound quality, multi-USB source mixing, or hot-swappable batteries. There's simply no real comparison here. The Arctis Nova Elite is well and truly in a category of its own. The Arctis Nova Elite is the ultimate gaming headset. It's the ultimate everything headset, frankly, able to easily accommodate high-end gaming, multi-device mixing for content creation, and day-to-day lifestyle use with ANC and Bluetooth. Its hi-res certification isn't just a sticker; it's immediately recognizable the second you commit a current to this headset. The sound reproduction puts the Arctis Nova Elite thoroughly in a category of its own, with few, if any, comparable peers. But boy howdy, it ain't cheap. You're going to either need to be a true all-day audio enthusiast, particularly fiscally affluent, or (like me) a poor financial planner to justify buying this. In my headset reviews, I tend to put a big emphasis on value for "most" people. Most of us are unlikely to look at a $599.99 headset and ever consider it an option — myself included. But with this, hearing is believing. It's one of the best headsets around. I've used my Arctis Nova Pro as my "daily" headset for several years at this point, and aside from some cushion wear, it's as good as it was the day I got it (and the cushions are easily replaced, too). If you were planning to use this headset for years and years, I think even the more budget-conscious could consider this headset, particularly if you wanted something you could use everywhere and anywhere. At the same time, would you feel comfy taking a $599.99 headset on the subway in that situation? I'm not sure I would. This headset is targeting a very specific type of customer unashamedly, and given what it offers, it's hard to penalize it for its price tag alone. The price makes sense given what's on offer. Whether or not it makes sense for your budget entirely depends on you and your needs. One thing I do know is you absolutely will not be disappointed. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a best-in-class headset boasting supreme versatility, comfort, audio, and specs. It also boasts a supreme price tag, shrugging off affordability for maximum features and luxury. You're either going to really want all of its features or have cash to burn to justify this headset, but either way, you won't be disappointed.

Title: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle is Dead, Here’s Why Bull Run is Not Over

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Bitcoin price has seen a significant pivot from its historic 4-year cycle that is supported by halving events. Science Author, Shanaka Anslem Perera, on X, pointed out that Bitcoin has pivoted from its historic 4-year cycle, which is driven by halving events. As a result of this shift, the coin’s traditional playbook of significant positive momentum has now become obsolete. Still, the crypto enthusiast does not think that Bitcoin’s bull run is over. Historically, Bitcoin’s performance has followed a four-year cycle, largely driven by halving events, which result in a reduction in the block reward. At every point in this cycle, the crypto ecosystem experienced a massive bull run, followed by sharp price corrections. Fast forward to the present day, and there seems to be a notable shift that has now rendered this traditional playbook obsolete. On October 6, 2025, Crypto Twitter declared Bitcoin’s cycle peak at $126,270. Then this was followed by a 21% drop in the coin’s price levels. BITCOIN’S 4-YEAR CYCLE JUST DIED AND NOBODY NOTICED Crypto Twitter exploded calling October 6th the cycle peak. Eighty-four percent crashes incoming. Bear market confirmed. Pack it up. Except the math says they are catastrophically wrong. Every indicator that called previous… pic.twitter.com/b6sj1kGn5e — Shanaka Anslem Perera ⚡ (@shanaka86) November 8, 2025 As a result, several influencers and analysts, armed with historical patterns, predicted an 84% crash and a prolonged bear market. However, Perera believes that there may be a different story to tell. There may still be hope, as he claims that the bull run is far from over. Apparently, key indicators such as the Pi Cycle, MVRV Z-Score, and Puell Multiple, which would usually signal the onset of a bull run, are unusually quiet. According to these metrics, the crypto market is in a mid-cycle consolidation, and not the end of the road. Perera believes that Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) may have played a vital role in redirecting the four-year cycle. Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed a staggering $64 billion, with giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and corporate treasuries acting as a vacuum for every whale dump. The influx of institutional investors into the sector may have rid Bitcoin of certain rollercoasters. On November 4, Coinspeaker reported that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of up to $186.5 million, led entirely by BlackRock’s IBIT. Within the last six days leading up to November 7, there were consistent outflows totaling $660 million. Within the last 24 hours, the sector has seen up to $240 million flood back into ETFs. In the wake of this situation, the Bitcoin price has recovered by 2.38% and is currently trading at $101,997.13. Consequently, Market experts have concluded that settlement, not sentiment, now governs Bitcoin’s price. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: Data-center operator CoreWeave is a stock-market darling. Bears see its finances as emblematic of an AI infrastructure bubble
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/coreweave-earnings-debt-ai-infrastructure-bubble/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. A vast data center in Plano, Texas, is a symbol of the enormous AI infrastructure boom that has boosted stock markets and driven U.S. economic growth over the past year. The data center occupies more than 450,000 square feet and cost $1.6 billion to construct and equip. It supplies 30 megawatts of computing power to train and run AI models. Yet the company that runs it is a leading candidate to be ground-zero for a future AI financial meltdown. The data center is one of dozens around the world operated by CoreWeave, a company that develops and manages data centers and sells their computing capacity to technology companies. Its business is at the center of the AI economy—providing computing power to meet the voracious demand of the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI. But CoreWeave doesn’t own the Plano facility, nor does it own most of the data hubs it’s operating. And that is a part of the problem. The company is built, by its own admission, on a mountain of debt—obligations it has piled up as it races to build out a network of server farms for its customers. And that mountain looms far larger than the piles of cash that CoreWeave has brought in the door so far. When the company announces earnings on Monday, bulls and bears alike will be watching to see how its revenue is growing, and whether it has been able to pare its losses. CoreWeave’s earnings are likely to be a bellwether for the state of the entire AI boom, and for the industry’s massive and expensive infrastructure buildout in particular. CoreWeave has $7.6 billion in current liabilities—bills that fall due within 12 months—on its balance sheet, and $11 billion in debt overall, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report, filed in August. Coming from a tech giant like Google or Microsoft with tens of billions in free cash flow, such numbers wouldn’t raise an eyebrow. But CoreWeave’s revenues were only $1.9 billion in 2024. On its Q2 earnings call, CEO Michael Intrator told analysts that full year 2025 revenue would land between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. On the same call, the CEO said he expected CoreWeave’s capex for the year would total between $20 billion and $23 billion. Those short-term figures pale beside a bigger and potentially more onerous obligation that isn’t on its balance sheet: the $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. Many of those payments are stretched over relatively long terms, of 10 years or more. Still, some of this is for data centers and office buildings that have not yet begun to operate or bring in revenue—representing a vulnerability if any of the as-yet-unprofitable startups CoreWeave sells computing services to are unable to meet their contractual obligations, or if construction delays mean CoreWeave is not able to provide capacity on time, allowing customers to cancel contracts. In a sense, Coreweave is a metaphor for the broader AI industry at the present moment, as top companies commit to enormous capex spending today in the confidence that it’ll be justified by future revenue from AI platforms and services. Investors appear to be broadly convinced by the company’s narrative: CoreWeave’s stock price is up 160% since the company’s IPO in March. But Fortune’s analysis of CoreWeave’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are laced with warnings and caveats, show how risky the company’s business model could be. In interviews with several analysts, bulls and bears agreed that CoreWeave’s fundamentals, as reflected in its filings, don’t currently add up. “A lot has to go right,” says Thomas Blakey, a managing director of software equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald, who rates CoreWeave “overweight.” (Of 26 equity analysts who currently cover the stock, 14 had the equivalent of buy or outperform ratings on the shares, while nine had “hold” ratings, and three had “underperform” or “sell” recommendations, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence.) The bears see CoreWeave as a strong candidate to find itself underwater with its mounting liabilities, making it potentially the first domino to fall in the AI ecosystem. “To say they’ll scale out of this is questionable,” says Gil Luria, the head of technology research at the investment firm D.A. Davidson. “I don’t see how it becomes more profitable.” He believes that the likeliest outcome for CoreWeave on a five-year time horizon is bankruptcy—either because its current customers will be able to rely on their own infrastructure by then, or because an increasingly stretched CoreWeave will no longer be able to borrow. In a statement to Fortune, a company spokesperson said that “CoreWeave’s capital structure and financial performance are strong and underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts signed with the world’s leading enterprises and AI labs who partner with CoreWeave because we deliver the best AI cloud.” The statement went on to say that the company structured its contracts to “support and repay any related debt obligations while generating additional free cash flow. CoreWeave operates in a supply-constrained market where demand far exceeds capacity, and our hyper-growth is evidence of the trust leading companies place in us to power their most critical AI workloads.” With the company continuing to make huge new spending commitments even as it books new future revenue, AI investors’ attention will be glued to its upcoming quarterly earnings report. One number that everyone will be watching is CoreWeave’s “remaining performance obligations,” or RPOs—essentially revenues that CoreWeave has booked but that have not yet been paid. (Like its scheduled lease payments, CoreWeave’s RPOs are excluded from its balance sheet.) If CoreWeave is booking the kinds of contracts that will pull it out of debt sooner rather than later, the RPOs level—and the forecast for how quickly those future bookings are likely to turn into actual cash—are where they would show up. The company has announced several major new deals since its last quarterly earnings announcement, including a $14.2 billion agreement to supply Meta with computing capacity, and an pact with AI startup Poolside for a data center stuffed with 40,000 Nvidia GPUs. So it is likely its RPO total will climb significantly. Wall Street analysts’ forecasts for the company’s 2026 revenue range from $10.9 billion to $14.9 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.Bulls argue that this is exactly how the boom will play out in CoreWeave’s favor: The revenue will come through, in great quantity, and its scale will solve the company’s problems by catching up with and then outpacing its capital expenditures. In that scenario, the company becomes the next Levi Strauss or Amazon Web Services, providing the “picks and shovels” of the AI boom, and getting filthy rich. “The potential is beyond the scope of our imagination at this point,” says Kevin Dede, a senior technology analyst at the financial services firm H.C. Wainwright, which rates CoreWeave a “buy.” But for now CoreWeave is miles away from being profitable and is bleeding cash, absent its ability to issue debt. The RPOs it reported in its most recent earnings that are likely to be realized in the next 12 months are not, on their own, sufficient to cover its current obligations and announced growth plans (more on that shortly). The company has razor-thin operating margins—1.6% in the past quarter. After accounting for its large interest expenses, those margins turn sharply negative. The company lost more than $600 million on $2.2 billion in revenue in the first six months of 2025. “That’s not great,” Luria says. “Is there any way that gap closes?”Barring an enormous surge in revenue over the next 12 months or so, the company will likely need to borrow more money, or renegotiate with creditors, in order to cover the obligations already on its books. To be sure, the AI boom could deliver that revenue surge—but even slight weakening in spending growth across the industry could hit CoreWeave disproportionately. Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm that is shorting the stock, is pithy in its conclusions: CoreWeave, it wrote in a September report, is “the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.” CoreWeave began as a crypto-mining company, a side project of a few friends who were hedge-fund traders. Crypto mining, like AI, relies heavily on graphic processing units, or GPUs, with the chips racing to solve complicated algorithms that spit out currency rewards for correctly verifying blockchain transactions, and CoreWeave was a steady buyer. Over time, Brian Venturo, one of the company’s founders, realized that the rise in AI would be a major factor fueling the surge in demand for the computing power of the GPUs that CoreWeave was already accumulating. Beginning in October 2021, CoreWeave entered into two deals with asset management firm Magnetar Capital, raising first $50 million in convertible notes, and then a year later, an additional $125 million, also in convertible notes. The company used nearly all of it to buy GPUs from Nvidia. Over the next few years, CoreWeave would secure billions of dollars in a combination of debt and equity, building out a sprawling array of data centers across the U.S., and eventually expanding to the U.K. This March, CoreWeave’s IPO made it one of the closest things to a pure-play AI company to debut on public markets. Initially, fears about the company’s debt load restrained its stock’s performance. But its shares took off in May after it reported its first quarterly earnings, including soaring revenue growth of 420% quarter-on-quarter. While the price has declined since a peak in June, CoreWeave shares closed on Friday at $104, up from a debut of $40. But as Luria puts it, the bear case for CoreWeave is simple math. The company’s business model is to borrow capital and then use that capital to build data centers filled with GPUs and then sell time on those GPUs to AI companies. “The question is, are they getting a sufficient return … on their investment to justify the interest they’re paying on their debt?” Luria says. Its most recent filings show how hefty that debt has become. The problem isn’t just the amount of CoreWeave’s debt. It’s the structure—most of it is more expensive than average for corporate debt, and much of it comes due in the next nine months. Of CoreWeave’s current liabilities, $3.6 billion is debt payable by June 30, 2026, just part of $11 billion in overall debt the company carries on its balance sheet. Much of that debt carries hefty interest rates of between 9% and 15%, according to the financial statements, with 11% being the weighted average rate overall. (This fall, rates on newly issued investment-grade corporate debt have hovered between 5.5% and 6%, according to Moody’s. The rate at which CoreWeave is able to borrow has come down over time, with most of its newer debt issued at closer to 9%. ) The majority of CoreWeave’s outstanding debt, its statements show, is in the form of two loans, called Delayed Draw Term Loan (DDTL)1.0 and DDTL 2.0. There is $1.8 billion outstanding on the DDTL 1.0, at a 15% interest rate, and $5 billion in DDTL 2.0, at an 11% interest rate. The company has begun payment on DDTL 1.0; quarterly principal payments on DDTL 2.0 are due beginning in January 2026. (The interest rates on both these loans are floating.) This is where the company’s RPOs come in. CoreWeave says that as of June 30 it had a little over $30 billion, the majority of which should turn into actual sales over the next four years. The company says 50% of that amount, or $15 billion, will be recognized in the next two years. Wall Street consensus forecasts are that the company’s revenues will be about $12 billion for next year. But if its operating margins remain at just 1.6%, the company will only generate $192 million in income from this revenue—not enough to cover its interest expenses or make the principal repayments on its debt. That implies that CoreWeave’s returns remain far below the cost of its capital. Higher RPOs, of course, would mean more revenue for CoreWeave next year. That said, there are also far more capital expenses to come. CoreWeave continues to spend heavily to purchase Nvidia GPUs—which make up the great majority of its capital expenditures—and other equipment to outfit its data centers. In the first half of 2025, for example, it invested $4.7 billion in property, plant and equipment while bringing in only $2.2 billion in revenue. The report from Kerrisdale cites similar concerns as Luria in justifying its short position. CoreWeave is “a debt-fueled GPU rental business with no moat, dressed up as innovation,” the firm writes, arguing that the stock faces a 90% downside. Luria and Kerrisdale both cite CoreWeave’s highly concentrated customer base as another potential peril—a reality that CoreWeave itself acknowledged in its last earnings report. “A substantial portion of our revenue is driven by a limited number of our customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, spend from one or a few of our top customers would adversely affect our business,” the company wrote. Most notably: In the second quarter of 2025, an eye-popping 71% of CoreWeave’s revenue came from Microsoft alone. To be sure, Microsoft has a better credit rating than many countries, including the United States, and is unlikely to renege on its contract with CoreWeave. And CoreWeave’s contracts with its lessees generally require them to pay to the ends of their leases even if they don’t wind up utilizing them, except in case of “nonperformance.” Much of CoreWeave’s utility has come from offering readily available compute as those companies raced to scale up their own operations. But with Microsoft set to spend tens of billions of dollars on developing its own data centers, it may not need CoreWeave’s services in the future. “They will pay their obligations, but the likelihood of them renewing at the end of the contract is much less guaranteed,” Luria says. CoreWeave’s other major customer, OpenAI, is another matter. In March, CoreWeave entered an agreement with Sam Altman’s AI giant, with OpenAI committed to paying $11.9 billion through October 2030, with a $4 billion expansion announced in May. But OpenAI itself has made commitments far beyond its current cash flow—including commitments in the many hundreds of billions to Oracle, Nvidia and other data center providers. If OpenAI runs into any financial troubles, Luria says, CoreWeave likely wouldn’t be first to receive payments, compared to much larger OpenAI partners like Microsoft, Amazon, or even Oracle. (That’s also the case for some of the other, smaller venture-backed and loss-making AI startups CoreWeave serves, such as poolside, Cohere, and Mistral.) To rely on CoreWeave’s ties to OpenAI, he says, “You have to believe that OpenAI is going to be unbelievably successful, so much so that it can pay everybody that’s ahead in line.” All of this means there’ll be plenty at stake when CoreWeave reports earnings on Monday. The company will also be digesting a recent setback: In late October, the shareholders of Core Scientific, a crypto miner with a hoard of computing resources that CoreWeave coveted, rejected CoreWeave’s $9 billion all-stock acquisition offer. (CoreWeave will console itself with a $270 million breakup fee—an amount that will help it cover the $360 million it is expected to pay Core Scientific to lease data center capacity from it next year. Overall, CoreWeave is on the hook to pay Core Scientific some $10 billion in future lease payments over the next 12 years, which may have been one reason CoreWeave was eager to try to use its highly-valued shares to purchase Core Scientific in an all-equity deal valued at $9 billion when the offer was initially made.) The argument for CoreWeave’s success is just as simple as the math against it: AI is going to represent a transformational shift in the global economy, and CoreWeave is powering the technology’s growth. As the development of AI accelerates, so will the demand for computing power from companies aside from the hyperscalers, all hungry for the services of providers like CoreWeave. What’s more, today’s creditors may be willing to wait a little longer for that demand to materialize: The lenders behind DDTL 2.0 recently renegotiated the terms of the loan to delay the start of principal payments. Blakey, at Cantor Fitzgerald, says that CoreWeave is already diversifying its customer base, noting the recent deal with Meta. “It’s a growth business,” he says, in reference to CoreWeave’s capital expenditures. “If business is growing, you have to invest against it.” He and other bulls see a future where the company is no longer laden with debt. Once CoreWeave sheds its liabilities over the next five years, Blakey says, a growing percent of its revenue can begin coming from infrastructure that’s already paid off, boosting CoreWeave’s margins. Moreover, Blakey says that new models of chips might run more efficiently or be able to fetch a higher premium from customers, allowing CoreWeave to hold more pricing power. Blakey says that those $30.1 billion in RPOs—the revenue that has been booked but not yet delivered—are likely to increase meaningfully in CoreWeave’s next earnings, based on recently announced agreements. But the number to watch might be the additional obligations in borrowing that the company will take on to service them: If those obligations scale up alongside the booked revenue, bears say, CoreWeave still risks running out of cash unless it takes on yet more debt, raises more equity, or gets existing creditors to extend terms. Blakey acknowledges that a sustainable path forward for CoreWeave is perilous. “A lot has to go right,” he says. Still, he compares the current moment in AI to the beginning of the smartphone era, where analysts doubted Apple’s claims that it would transform global communication. “CoreWeave is a leader there in terms of this market,” Blakely says. “If they can maintain that lead … they will be able to participate in the spoils.” CORRECTIONS: An earlier version of this story stated incorrectly that Coreweave’s quarterly principal payments for DDTL 1.0 would begin in January 2026; those payments have already begun. The original version also misspelled the surname of Thomas Blakey. This article was updated to add a range of analysts’ projections for CoreWeave’s 2026 revenue. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: It’s not a bubble, because AI is already running the markets

AI isn’t a bubble. It’s already reshaping markets. Autonomous AI agents now drive trading, outperforming humans and rewriting how money moves. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World While the world debates whether AI is the next dot-com bubble, chasing valuations rather than implications, they’re missing the underlying innovation story. The same AI infrastructure fueling trillion-dollar bets is already rewriting how money moves. AI is no longer an investment theme. It’s the market itself. What few noticed is that the same AI infrastructure driving the headlines is already reshaping the markets from within. The invisible battle happening behind the candlesticks isn’t bulls and bears anymore; it’s between self-learning AIs that never sleep. Markets aren’t just humans using algorithms. They’re autonomous swarms fighting for milliseconds. Agents watch every market 24/7, spotting risks, debating strategies and executing without hesitation. Recent breakthroughs in AI and blockchain acceptance have created the perfect conditions for agentic markets to flourish. AI provides cognition; meanwhile, blockchain supplies trust, verification and payment rails. This offers the medium for AI agents to transact, prove, and exchange value freely. AI has crossed the chasm from stock picker to near-autonomous day trader. It learns and acts faster than any human. It spots what humans miss, predicts the move before it happens and never second-guesses itself. It’s the ultimate insider, without inflaming the SEC. It’s early days for agentic AI in trading, but make no mistake — it’s here and already moving the markets while most traders sleep. During the biggest crypto flash crash on Oct. 10, while the rest of the crypto market was in freefall, AI agents did the opposite. They stayed calm, shorted the chaos, and ended the week up 40%. They gave us a glimpse into the future of markets. One where the AI agents don’t just follow code, they respond like real traders. Some cut risk instantly. Others waited for confirmation. A few leaned into the drawdown. What’s striking is not just the gains, it’s the composure. Each AI agent made its own independent decisions, yet collectively, they converged on profitable outcomes. That’s the essence of agentic intelligence, autonomous systems learning to interpret chaos as opportunity. Companies describe similar behavior within trading desks, where agentic systems parse live data from public disclosures and feed execution layers in real-time. Over time, agents evolve from code to cognition. Autonomous systems that read markets, understand intent and execute strategies on their own. Acting like a digital hive mind, adjusting logic mid-session as markets shift around them. For years, quant funds and high-frequency traders have pitted humans plus algorithms against the market. Enter AI versus AI. Self-directed systems plan, reason and execute around the clock. What’s emerging is a battlefield of AIs — institutional, retail, and synthetic — talking to each other in real-time. When AI trades with AI, human intent disappears. Prices move on machine-to-machine negotiations, not emotion or fundamentals. The market begins to trade itself. Related: AI gives retail investors a way out of the diversification trap A majority of global trading volume now runs through algorithmic systems, estimates ranging from 60% to 89%, depending on the market. Within months, Symphony’s agentic trading layer was clearing $140 million in transactions, working with 15 of the world’s biggest financial institutions to test self-learning yield and execution agents. For decades, investing was about finding an edge. AI gives retail investors that power for the first time. Retail traders can soon deploy the same logic once reserved for billion-dollar funds. Swarm intelligence that scans arbitrage, simulates momentum, hedges risk and executes collaboratively. It’s the retail equivalent of a hedge fund in your pocket. The walls between institutional and retail finance are eroding. AI makes the 1%’s playbook accessible to the 99%. The next outperformers will deploy agentic swarms, rather than tracking indexes. AI versus AI warfare will define liquidity, volatility and price discovery. Humans will still set direction, risk tolerance and capital allocation, but won’t press the buttons. Markets will begin to self-trade in swarms of autonomous participants. Power will shift to whomever fine-tunes the feedback loops. When agents detect each other’s footprints, they’ll evolve meta-strategies, sometimes to cooperate, sometimes to manipulate one another. Trading floors are going quiet. The next generation of traders won’t shout orders; they’ll train AI agents. The winners won’t just be institutions, they’ll be retail traders who fine-tune their swarms alongside human judgment. We’re entering the agentic arms race. Markets of tomorrow won’t sleep or panic. Agentic AI will learn, evolve, compete and occasionally conspire at breakneck speed. While institutions continue to build layers of agents, retail investors face a choice. Follow the herd into AI stocks, or start training their own AI as their wing(wo)man. They won’t have an AlphaGo moment. Quiet, relentless outperformance hides in the charts, open to anyone brave enough to seize their AI agent. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World.

It was a blockbuster week for bitcoin mining news, and the clearest sign yet that miners’ AI ambitions are entering the big leagues. Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) inked a $5.5 billion, 15-year lease with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN) for 300 megawatts at its Bear Lake facility, while IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) announced a $9.7 billion, five-year agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) for 200 megawatts of cloud compute in Texas. Hashprice tumbled to fresh lows near $40 per petahash per day, Bitcoin retraced to $101,000, and Cipher also unveiled plans for a one-gigawatt data center joint venture. And in the background, Warren Buffett’s Pacific Power failed to deliver power to Amazon, a development that could funnel even more demand toward Bitcoin miners with spare megawatts. You’re reading a recap of The Mining Pod. Watch the full episode on YouTube. Cipher announced a 15-year, $5.5 billion lease agreement with Amazon Web Services to host AI workloads at its 300-megawatt Bear Lake facility. The site is scheduled to come online in July 2026, marking AWS’s latest move to secure long-term compute capacity amid surging AI demand. The partnership makes Cipher one of the first public Bitcoin miners to land a hyperscaler as a direct tenant. Cipher also revealed plans for a new one-gigawatt data center project dubbed “Colchis,” in which the company will retain a 95% ownership stake. Despite the historic announcement, Cipher’s stock slid more than 10% Friday, caught in a broader tech-sector sell-off. The company’s $5.5 billion deal value dwarfs its own $8 billion market cap, underscoring investor enthusiasm for miners with AI exposure. Concurrent with Cipher’s own deal, IREN signed a five-year, $9.7 billion cloud compute agreement with Microsoft to deliver 200 megawatts of critical IT load at its Childress, Texas site. The company will also collaborate with Dell in a separate $5.8 billion procurement deal to supply servers, cables, and supporting hardware for its new liquid-cooled data centers “Horizon 1” and “Horizon 4.” The twin announcements represent one of the largest combined partnerships between a Bitcoin miner and major tech firms to date. Like Cipher, IREN’s shares fell roughly 10% on the day, but analysts called the Microsoft deal a “watershed moment” for miners pivoting toward AI and HPC infrastructure. The agreement validates the “powershell” model miners are pursuing: providing power and physical infrastructure for AI tenants while leaving GPU cluster management to specialized partners. Still, open questions remain over IREN’s own GPU strategy and its 20,000-unit Neo Cloud cluster, which could serve as a proving ground for independent AI compute capabilities. Beyond the AI headlines, traditional mining economics continued to worsen. Hashprice fell to around $40 per petahash per day, levels not seen since the spring downturn following President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. Bitcoin’s price has pulled back from highs near $126,000 to roughly $101,000, with network difficulty up more than 6% in the most recent adjustment. “The streets are bleeding,” Mining Pod analyst Matt Kimmel said. “Hash rice is flatlining, fees are dry, and the only excitement left in mining is AI.” The bleak trend underscores the widening gap between miners chasing compute diversification and those still dependent on Bitcoin block rewards. Q3 results from leading miners offered a snapshot of an industry in transition: With AI contracts now dictating sentiment, shares of several miners appear to be pricing in future deal flow rather than immediate mining economics. In a twist tying Warren Buffett to the week’s biggest AI news, Amazon reportedly filed a complaint against Berkshire Hathaway–owned Pacific Power for failing to deliver sufficient electricity to new data centers in Oregon. The shortfall, according to Bloomberg, has forced AWS to seek alternative partners, a potential win for miners like Cipher that already control scalable, low-cost energy infrastructure. The incident follows lawsuits against Pacific Power related to wildfire liabilities, adding pressure on the utility as hyperscalers scramble for new capacity. To close the week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned that China could overtake the U.S. in the AI arms race, citing cheaper power, looser regulations, and government-backed industrial policy. Speaking at the Financial Times’ Future of AI Summit, Huang said Western “cynicism” and fragmented state-level rules risked slowing U.S. innovation. If China continues expanding its power grid and chip manufacturing base, he said, “they will come.” For miners, that comment hit close to home. As U.S. firms repurpose Bitcoin data centers for AI, the global race for compute, and the energy to fuel it, is accelerating on all fronts. Bitcoin’s first industry publication.

To close the week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned that China could overtake the U.S. in the AI arms race, citing cheaper power, looser regulations, and government-backed industrial policy. Speaking at the Financial Times’ Future of AI Summit, Huang said Western “cynicism” and fragmented state-level rules risked slowing U.S. innovation. If China continues expanding its power grid and chip manufacturing base, he said, “they will come.” For miners, that comment hit close to home.

Title: Bubble Trouble: Is too much being spent on AI?
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1108/1542794-ai-bubble-tech/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T07:00:00Z
Full Content:
Adam Maguire Business Journalist Michael Burry - the man who famously spotted the US subprime mortgage crisis years before most others - thinks there's an AI bubble. This week it was revealed that he had taken a $1.1 billion bet against chip-maker Nvidia and Peter Thiel’s Palantir – where he will profit if their stock prices fall. But it’s not just professional market sceptics like Burry that think things may be overheated in tech. Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, recently warned that US stocks – in particular tech stocks - are over-heated. Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs head David Soloman have also warned of an impending correction. Even big tech cheerleaders like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have said there is an AI bubble. Meanwhile Sam Altman, the head of AI revolution icon OpenAI, thinks valuations and spending has gotten carried away. Why do they think this is a bubble? You can get some clue of why if you look at the quarterly results some of the world’s big tech companies published last week. Microsoft, for example, said it spent nearly $35 billion on capital expenditure in the quarter. Capital expenditure wouldn’t necessarily all be AI-related but in this case the vast bulk of it is. To put that figure into context, the measures included in Ireland’s Budget 2026 were worth around €9.4 billion - or roughly $10.8 billion. So Microsoft spent more than three times the Government's annual Budget package in a single quarter. Meanwhile Facebook owner Meta said it would spend as much as $72 billion on capital expenditure this year. Google owner Alphabet said it would spend up to $93 billion. Amazon said its full year capital budget would be $125 billion this year – and even higher next year. And that’s just four of the big tech companies - it wouldn’t include AI spending by other large firms like Apple, Tesla, X, Oracle or Palantir. Nor would it include the tens hundreds of millions - or even billions - being spent by other big-but-not-massive companies. Or the money being invested by venture capitalists and private equity. And most of that money is ultimately going towards building data centres and buying high end computer chips - but it’s also being spent at employee level too. Back in June Sam Altman claimed that Meta was offering his top engineers pay packets valued at $300m if they moved over to Team Zuckerberg. That included a $100m signing-on bonus. The likes of Meta have also spent billions to buy stakes in, or acquire outright, AI startups that have promising-looking ideas. The scale of all of this is so significant that Goldman Sachs estimated that AI investment was a bigger contributor to growth in the US economy in the first half of the year than consumer spending. In fact, if you took out the money being spent on AI, the US economy was stagnant in the first half of the year. And tech companies’ valuations have risen to match – largely based on the promise and expectation that all this spending now will result in them making even more money in the not-too-distant future. Are there any signs of that happening? No - An MIT study in August found that, when you strip away all the hype, 95% of firms were getting zero return on their AI investments. It’s not entirely true to say that no-one is making money from AI… some are. Or, more specifically, one company is. So far the only clear winner from the AI race is Nvidia, which designs the computer chips that are powering all of these data centres that big tech firms are rushing to build. It’s gone from being a relatively niche player in the market to being the most valuable listed company in the world. As recently as its 2020 results, Nvidia had profits of $2.8 billion – which isn’t bad by any measure. But now, in the single quarter between May and July, it had a profit of $26.4 billion. It is now comfortably on track to make more than $100 billion in profit this year – which would be about 36 times the profit it made just a few years ago. For most others, though, it’s a different story. Despite their huge investments to date the likes of Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft have yet to really show the benefit AI has brought to their bottom line. Some are pointing to it being a cost-saving measure – Amazon’s recent jobs cuts, for example, were framed as them leaning on AI to be able to reduce bureaucracy. But if that’s the rationale it will take many more cuts to justify the hundreds of billions of investment. And it’s not just the big tech companies that are struggling to make it viable – the dedicated AI creators are not seeing a return yet either. Anthropic made a $5.3 billion loss last year. Elon Musk’s xAI is predicted to record a $13 billion loss this year. Even the poster-child of AI – OpenAI – made a $5 billion loss last year. That means that every time you ask ChatGPT to compose an email for you, or ask it to devise the best scrambled eggs recipe, it’s costing them money. Despite that, there are suggestions it could be valued at $1 trillion when it floats on the New York Stock Exchange in the not-too-distant future. So if it’s not making money, what’s the justification for that valuation? OpenAI and its backers hope it is following the same kind of playbook we’ve seen from so many tech start-ups over the years. This is where it has a great idea, great technology and great people – and once it builds a big enough customer base and gains efficiencies of scale, the profits will start to flow. And, in fairness, its revenue looks to have more than doubled year on year – and it recently started to unveil a range of products and services it plans to provide – including a web-browser, which will open the door to it service ads too. In the meantime, though, they’ve also committed to invest around $1.4 trillion in other companies over the next few years – which will include buying computer chips and data centre capacity to help handle the queries from all of those extra customers. But within those deals it’s making is also an interesting dynamic that has added to concerns about an AI bubble – and that’s how a lot of the investment that’s taking place seem to be almost circular. For example, one big part of OpenAI’s recent investments was a $300 billion deal with Oracle to tap into its data centre capacity. In turn, Oracle has committed to spend tens of billions of dollars to buy Nvidia chips to power its data centres. Meanwhile, Nvidia has invested $100 billion of its money into OpenAI. Which essentially means that the three companies are passing billions of dollars around in a circle. So if this is a bubble, what happens when it bursts? Well the first thing there is the 'when’ of the when. Just because there’s a growing consensus that there is a bubble, doesn’t mean that it’s ready to pop. Going back to Michael Burry – he made his first bet against the subprime mortgage market in mid-2005; it took pretty much two years for that bet to pay off. And as readers (or viewers) of The Big Short may remember, he received a lot of flak during those two years from investors who thought he was costing them a fortune. It should also be said that, while he was right that time, he can be wrong too. He took bets out against big tech stocks in 2023 too, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen by nearly 80% since then. But assuming it is a matter of ‘when’ and not ‘if’, there are a whole range of predictions around what a burst AI bubble might mean. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has kind of downplayed his company’s exposure - saying that spending all of this money on data centres now was essentially just front-loading what they’ll need in the years ahead. So, he argues, worst case scenario it’ll just mean they’ll be futureproofed against a natural growth of demand for its services in the years ahead. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos suggested that while this is a bubble, it wouldn’t be a ‘bad’ bubble like the financial crisis. Instead he said it would be a ‘good’ bubble, comparing it to the Dot Com crash. His argument is that while a lot of companies collapsed in the Dot Com crash, a handful that had good ideas and viable models – including Amazon and Google – survived and thrived. He thinks the same will happen here – the tide will go out and expose those that can’t back up all of their big talk, but the useful platforms will stick it out and usher in big changes for the world. Of course that comparison does skirt over the negative impact this kind of ‘good’ bubble can have. All of those bankruptcies and valuation write-downs means lost investments and a shock to the stock market, which perhaps impacts people’s pensions, and likely leads to job cuts too. So it wouldn’t just be a case of adjusting a balance sheet or two and moving on. But is there the potential for contagion? Again, it depends first and foremost on how much more bubbly the bubble gets before it bursts. But no more than AI investment is feeding growth in the wider US and world economy right now, a dramatic collapse in investment and valuations in the sector will have a knock-on effect on national and global GDP too. There’s also the very practical impact of jobs cuts – direct and indirect. If it turns out that the AI industry has gotten too big and expensive, some of those being hired now will likely be let go. Meanwhile companies that see the value of their AI investments getting written down may need to make cuts elsewhere to cover their losses. It could also have a knock-on impact on areas like construction and consumer spending. And one concern around a potential AI crash relates to that circularity of investment that’s being seen at the moment. A big part of the boom in Nvidia’s revenue is based on the scramble to make use of OpenAI’s tools. Oracle’s stock price also reflects the fact that it’s been promised $300 billion of business from OpenAI in the coming years. As a major shareholder in OpenAI, Microsoft’s valuation is also boosted by the belief that Sam Altman’s firm will become massively profitable in the near future. Meanwhile Amazon has done its own multi-billion dollar deal with OpenAI to provide it with data centre capacity to power its AI platforms. That means that all of those big tech companies have a lot to gain from OpenAI’s success – and a lot to lose if it turns out that the technology isn’t nearly as useful as many hope. Its importance to these major firms has led to suggestions by some that the company is already too big to fail. Some have even started to call for it to be broken up to reduce the systemic risk it poses. That’s despite the fact that it’s currently still privately held, and still losing billions of dollars a year. Business Journalist Follow@AdamMaguire © RTÉ 2025.

Title: NetEase shuts down Bad Brain Games Studio after The Midnight Riders project fails to secure funding

In another unfortunate event in the games industry, NetEase has shuttered its Canadian subsidiary, Bad Brain Games Studios, making it the second studio to close under the publisher this week, following Fantastic Pixel Castle. Bad Brain Games, based out of Toronto, was established in 2023 and consisted of former Ubisoft developers, particularly from the Watch Dogs series. The studio confirmed it will halt operations on November 17, 2025, after failing to secure new funding or investment for its project, codenamed The Midnight Riders. Studio head Sean Crooks broke the news on LinkedIn and said, “It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors.” He explained that the studio had explored every avenue to secure external investment, but to no avail. He praised the team’s “creativity and commitment” as they “pushed creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft.” The Midnight Riders was supposed to be a retro-themed action-adventure game featuring a group of school-going teenagers, exploring mysterious worlds on bicycles and hunting down eldritch horrors with everyday objects like slingshots and baseball bats. Bad Brain Games released a small sizzle reel that drew tons of praise for the project’s art direction and intriguing gameplay. Despite the sudden halt in The Midnight Riders' development, Crooks stated that the project and its IP remain “available with acquisition or partnership.” The studio is still clinging to hope as Crooks said, “We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.” Bad Brain Games Studios consisted of nearly two dozen employees, many of whom had been poached from major studios. Unfortunately, staff members are scrambling for new opportunities amid a brutal wave of layoffs in the video game industry, which has left tens of thousands of developers out of work. Crooks wrapped up the post, stating, “Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.” This is the third NetEase-related high-profile studio shut down in recent months. The first casualty was T-Minus Zero Entertainment. Yet T-Minus Zero managed to strike a deal with a consortium of veteran directors and founders for the studio’s name and assets. Bad Brain Games Midnight Riders hangs in limbo, awaiting any interested bidder willing to revive the title. Buy Watch Dogs: Legion on Amazon Bad Brain Games Studios - Linkedin

Title: BioWare is still working on the next Mass Effect game, the studio says in N7 Day message — "EA and BioWare remain committed."

For N7 Day 2025, BioWare shares a message reiterating that the next Mass Effect game is in development. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Role-playing game developer BioWare has traditionally shared new teases, updates, or messages to the Mass Effect player community on November 7, or "N7 Day," reflecting the in-game designation for special operatives. For N7 Day 2025, BioWare declined to share any new tidbits about its next game, instead simply reiterating that the game is coming, pushing back against recent online chatter that it's in trouble or will be cancelled. "You’ve made it clear you care deeply about what’s next. So let’s start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," the statement reads. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show."This comes as Electronic Arts' (EA's) overall game division has seen a turbulent past few months. At the start of the year, BioWare was subjected to layoffs, reducing the studio down to under 100 staff. In April, hundreds of additional workers were laid off, including some at Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi developer Respawn Entertainment. More cuts came shortly after, with EA cancelling a Black Panther game and closing the developer.Now, EA has agreed to go private in a deal financed by private equity and Saudi Arabian investment, leading to concerns over the tone and content present in future games, as well as fears of additional cuts. While the next Mass Effect game was first announced with a teaser back in 2020, extremely little has been shared since then. BioWare did present a new teaser for N7 Day 2023, which showed off a new character design and hinted towards a possible game title of Epsilon (or Mass Effect 5, in a more literal sense). While there are no new tidbits regarding what players can expect from the next Mass Effect game, BioWare's update does shed some light on the long-gestating Mass Effect TV series in production at Amazon. We now know that the series will take place after the events of the original trilogy, and it is not going to be a retelling of the story of Commander Shepard.This is similar in approach to the Fallout TV series (which was also produced by Amazon), which is set years after the events of Fallout 4. I previously argued it would be a mistake to try and have a "canon" Commander Shepard and accompanying choices in the TV series, so I'm certainly happy to see BioWare confirm things won't go that way.Finally, there's a curious pattern scattered throughout the message. A few letters of different words in BioWare's blog post are italicized, and put together, they spell out "URL KROGAN."Combined with a vague post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Mass Effect account, some players quickly figured out that it linked to a new piece of artwork, presenting a Krogan civil War. The Krogan are easily my favorite race in the Mass Effect universe, so I'm already speculating about just what this event could entail.As for the message itself, while I certainly understand what BioWare is aiming to do here, it's still hard not to feel worried. I wish the team the best, and I hope things go well in the months and years to come. Mass Effect Legendary Edition compiles all three original games into one remastered package. It's a must-play for any fans of action-RPGs, and you can snag an Xbox copy for just $9 right now. See at: Loaded (formerly CDKeys) No, the next Mass Effect game does not have a release date or even the vaguest window. Extremely little is known at this time.

She transitioned into reporting while working for Rock the Vote, Future Majority and Wiretap Magazine, covering the Millennial Generation's perspective during the presidential elections. As a political writer, Burris has had bylines at CNN, Salon.com, BNR, and AlterNet and serves as a senior digital editor for RawStory.com. Women in Media Center The Nasdaq Composite had its worst week since April this week, numbers show. Market Watch attributed the flop to the tech industry and the government shutdown. Yahoo Finance cited "seesaw stretches for 'Magnificent Seven' stalwarts Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). The S&P 500 and the Dow also closed out the bumpy week in the red as persistent worries about an AI bubble and Big Tech valuations run high." MSNBC VP of editorial and bookings, Jesse Rodriguez, wrote on X, "US stock indexes are on track for their worst five-day start to November since 2008." "The Warren Buffett Indicator (market cap to GDP), the Shiller CAPE ratio (stock prices to earnings), and my Dr. X bubble detector are at record highs. WHEN WILL THE BUBBLE BURST?" asked Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. "You can get people to believe a lot of things, but I guarantee you can't get them to believe grocery prices are down," said chief economist Tim Duy at SGH Macro Advisors, referring to President Donald Trump's argument that prices for everything are better. Stock associate Mike Bostic flagged concerns over the labor market, shutdown and AI bubble as the possible cause. "Ping! Is that the bubble bursting?! Bad day for American AI and tech stocks today..." said academic researcher Dr. Ian McCormick. He later added, "The selloff seems to be driven by anxiety over the ongoing US government shutdown, the resulting dearth of economic data, and warnings that an AI bubble might burst soon." In the background, "Elon will be a trillionaire. Wild," said Certified Financial Education Instructor Kalu Aja. "Thanks, Donald!" blamed media executive John Goodman.

Title: Is it time to end Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption?

Two U.S. senators, including one from Utah, are taking another swing at ending Major League Baseball’s century-old exemption from antitrust laws. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn a longstanding precedent that has shielded professional baseball from the nation’s antitrust laws. Lee in a statement said baseball for too long has enjoyed an exemption from the competition laws that apply to every other professional sport and business in the country. “As I’ve said before, baseball understands best of all the benefits of competition,” said Lee, chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights. “Sadly, our Supreme Court has historically balked at the opportunity to overturn a wrongly decided case, and subject professional baseball to the same competition laws as every other professional sport. It is time for America’s pastime to be revitalized by the laws governing all American businesses.” Lee introduced legislation in 2023 to end the exemption. Booker, the subcommittee ranking member, said baseball has enjoyed a “free pass” to break the rules of fair competition because of a flawed Supreme Court ruling, one that the court itself has acknowledged was a mistake. “The one-of-a-kind antitrust exemption gives leagues the power to artificially control salaries, ticket prices, team relocations, and more, harming players and baseball fans alike,” he said in a statement. In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled in Federal Baseball Club v. National League that the Sherman Antitrust Act does not apply to professional baseball, specifically to “[t]he business [of] giving exhibitions of base ball [sic].” In that case, the Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, a team and member of the Federal League, sued the National League and the American League, claiming they had conspired to monopolize the business of professional baseball by buying out members of the Federal League and by inducing its members to leave. The court decided that pro baseball games were not interstate commerce and were therefore outside the scope of the antitrust act because they were exhibitions, rather than a business affecting trade or commerce among the states. The senators’ brief comes in the case of Cangrejeros de Santurce Baseball Club, LLC v. Liga de Beisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico, Inc. They argue in the filing that modern professional baseball bears no resemblance to the localized exhibitions in 1922 and is a multibillion-dollar interstate enterprise indistinguishable from other professional sports. The case involves a dispute between the former owner of a professional baseball franchise in Puerto Rico and the league, its president and other franchise owners. The owner, Thomas Axon, a financial professional from New York, alleges that the league conspired to force him to relinquish control of the team, violating the Sherman Antitrust Act and other laws. Axon claims that the league’s actions were in retaliation for his criticism of the conditions at the team’s publicly-owned stadium and his threat to move the team to another city. The case has worked its way through various courts over the past three years. Attorneys for Axon petitioned the Supreme Court in October to take up the case. “The baseball antitrust exemption is no longer sustainable (if ever it was), and it should be overruled. The exemption’s conceptual foundation — that the business of baseball is not interstate commerce and thus not subject to federal economic regulation at all — was questionable from the start and is today wholly indefensible," according to the petition. The Supreme Court addressed the baseball exemption twice before. In 1953, it upheld the exemption. In 1972, it continued the exemption based on precedent set by prior cases and saying Congress must correct any errors in previous decisions by amending the antitrust laws. Lee and Booker argue in the brief that Congress should not be required to fix a “mistaken interpretation” of the law — when the court can and should overrule the Federal Baseball decision now. Congress has considered bills in the past to do away with baseball’s exemption, with the late Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch among those leading the charge in the 1990s. In 1998, it passed the Curt Flood Act partially repealing the exemption, allowing major league players to sue MLB for employment-related matters, such as compensation and working conditions. The law does not apply to minor league players, franchise relocation or other areas of baseball’s business. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has defended baseball in response to a Senate Judiciary Committee inquiry about the exemption in 2023. He argued that “it may not be possible” for the league to enforce, establish and maintain better working conditions for minor leaguer players if the exemption were lifted. “Without coordinated oversight and decision-making by MLB, it is likely that more Minor League affiliates will leave their existing communities for a superior player-development environment, and that fewer — rather than more — Minor League clubs affiliated with MLB clubs will exist in the future,” he wrote. As ESPN reported, Manfred argued that the league must maintain the current player development system because it already spends $1 billion annually to support the minor leagues, which do not make a profit and are subsidized by MLB teams. That allows teams to provide low ticket prices and remain in areas that otherwise could not “economically support a professional baseball team.”

Title: Last month marked worst October for layoffs in more than 20 years: Challenger

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 10:10:17 AM PST by SeekAndFind Technology firms led private-sector job cuts as employers looked to cut costs and address AI. Last month was the worst October for layoff announcements since 2003 as companies slashed roles to save money, pared back pandemic-era hires, and planned ahead for artificial intelligence, according to the global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers announced 153,074 cuts last month, compared to 55,597 cuts in October 2024. Last month’s figure was “the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a report Thursday. Altogether, US firms announced the end of 1,099,500 positions through the first 10 months of this year, up 44% from the 761,358 cuts seen for the entirety of 2024. Technology businesses led private-sector layoffs. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Challenger said in a statement. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he continued. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” Recent notable layoff announcements have come from Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), and UPS (UPS). Year-to-date cuts are at their highest since 2020, Challenger said, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the labor market. The Challenger report comes amid a data drought from the Labor Department due to the government shutdown — now the longest in US history. The last official jobs report reflects labor conditions from August, while data from September has yet to be published. October’s jobs report, due out tomorrow, is unlikely to be published.

The Federal Reserve officially sets its benchmark for an optimum percentage of full employment at an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. Full employment is defined as the optimal range of unemployment where there a balance between the number of Americans gainfully employed and those seeking new job positions to avoid the negative economic consequences of labor shortages. Economists typically use 4-6% unemployment as an optimum number in our economy. If unemployment numbers go above an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are out of work but if unemployment numbers go below an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are working and there are the potential for serious labor shortages At unemployment levels below 5.0% people who are looking for jobs are in high demand and can find a new and often better job quickly and with little difficulty. As of now, at an official 4.35 % unemployment we are well below the 5.0 % unemployment levels that the Federal Reserves considers the optimum for a healthy, dynamic economy that balances job mobility, full employment and an adequate pool of skilled workers so that employers can readily hire the kind of labor force they need without shortages. In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth. 15 posted on 11/07/2025 10:49:19 AM PST by rdcbn1 (..when poets buy guns, tourist season is over................Walter R.

Last month’s figure was “the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a report Thursday. Altogether, US firms announced the end of 1,099,500 positions through the first 10 months of this year, up 44% from the 761,358 cuts seen for the entirety of 2024. Technology businesses led private-sector layoffs. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Challenger said in a statement. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he continued. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” Recent notable layoff announcements have come from Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), and UPS (UPS). Year-to-date cuts are at their highest since 2020, Challenger said, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the labor market. The Challenger report comes amid a data drought from the Labor Department due to the government shutdown — now the longest in US history. The last official jobs report reflects labor conditions from August, while data from September has yet to be published. October’s jobs report, due out tomorrow, is unlikely to be published.

The Federal Reserve officially sets its benchmark for an optimum percentage of full employment at an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. Full employment is defined as the optimal range of unemployment where there a balance between the number of Americans gainfully employed and those seeking new job positions to avoid the negative economic consequences of labor shortages. Economists typically use 4-6% unemployment as an optimum number in our economy. If unemployment numbers go above an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are out of work but if unemployment numbers go below an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are working and there are the potential for serious labor shortages At unemployment levels below 5.0% people who are looking for jobs are in high demand and can find a new and often better job quickly and with little difficulty. As of now, at an official 4.35 % unemployment we are well below the 5.0 % unemployment levels that the Federal Reserves considers the optimum for a healthy, dynamic economy that balances job mobility, full employment and an adequate pool of skilled workers so that employers can readily hire the kind of labor force they need without shortages. In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth. 15 posted on 11/07/2025 10:49:19 AM PST by rdcbn1 (..when poets buy guns, tourist season is over................Walter R.

In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth. 15 posted on 11/07/2025 10:49:19 AM PST by rdcbn1 (..when poets buy guns, tourist season is over................Walter R.

In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth.

In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth. There is no such thing as a labor shortage. There are only wage shortages. Speaking as someone knee-deep? No, the jobs being replaced are not “worthless” - they’re simply getting priced out. I still need code. I still need QA. I still need analytics. For example, I still need QA done on a new product, new feature, etc. And a lot of QA is simply click, watch, report results. QA is traditionally an entry-level role - and the people who traditionally excelled and advanced were the ones who didn’t just punch a clock, record results, but learned to go further and do things like suggest a remedy or refine the report so corrections were properly/more rapidly routed. The role has value. But now? I can whip up an agentic AI solution that can do the clicks and more? Replace an analyst doing the routing. Too many people hear “AI” and they lean on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation - basically, turning it look on the wild universe) and think it’s all about asking silly gotcha questions. The reality is: Within my limited stack, with lighter-RAG touches? I can - and we are - using agentic AI in closed boxes to replace a lot of entry-level work. I won’t argue that’s scary for the younger generation - and it should be! - but the reality is that a token-cost spend is maybe 10% of an FTE. I still need that work done - but nobody is going to spend 10X the cost to do it. My advice would be that it’s no different than any other technical advancement - and that’s been a fact of life forever. Automation, computers, networks, you name it. Make yourself valuable. Complain to the wind, or learn to adapt and figure out the value proposition. If Ai can make it cheaper to run a business by needing less employees I hope this leads to smaller businesses being able to compete. We will see how it goes Bingo Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-22 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Title: BioWare are "focused exclusively" on the next Mass Effect, says exec producer, along with a Krogan teaser

"We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build..." Even as the consortium led by Donald Trump's haunted finger puppet Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund proceed with their wildly leveraged $50 billion acquisition of Electronic Arts, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble would like everybody to know that we're just fine, you guys. Everything is hunkey-dorey over here at BioWare, a studio whose last few, famously difficult original videogame projects both severely undershot commercial expectations, as we gaze down the barrel of a buyout that will leave our parent organisation $20 billion in debt and beholden to new owners who may disagree with everything we stand for, and who allegedly want to juice the screws with generative AI. Happy N7 Day, you bastards. Here's a cute coded message for you about the future of Mass Effect, 13 years since the last indisputably good one (sorry Nic). Please ignore the tears streaming down my face. OK, so this characterisation is both mean-spirited and quite silly, but I cannot read Gamble's smiling words without hearing somebody cocking a Kessler out of shot. "Like you, we've heard the rumors lately," he acknowledges, after some seasonal preamble. "You've made it clear you care deeply about what's next. So let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe." For context, the next Mass Effect game was sort-of-announced in 2020. Since then, there has been the occasional snippet of info about the possible return of the Geth and the definite return of senior developers from the original trilogy, but nothing of real substance, for BioWare's attention has been firmly fixed on the completion of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The latter missed EA's opening quarterly targets, prompting mass layoffs in a year when EA staff earned less on average while CEO Andrew Wilson got himself a pay rise. All this was before the proposed $50 billion dollar acquisition, which has led one former Dragon Age executive to speculate that EA might sell BioWare or close them down. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble went on. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show." He also gave an update on the forthcoming Mass Effect TV show, on which BioWare are collaborating with Amazon. Amazon, the revolting business empire that turned Sauron into an office creep, though I will concede they did an OK job with Fallout. "The writers room is going strong, and we've got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game," Gamble added. "The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story - because after all ... that's YOUR story, isn't it?" It is, Mike, and I'll thank Jeff Bezos to keep his stinking space colonisation fantasies away from my precious Normandy. If you're wondering why the blog post text looks weird, that's because as with N7 Day bulletins of yore, it contains a hidden message. Tot up all the italicised words, including game names, and you get "u r l Mass Effect k r g a n", unless I've missed a few. Which I guess points towards a website of some kind, while teasing that the Krogan are in Mass Effect 5. I've jumbled the letters up several times and I can't find a way to make it read "please Sony buy us".

The Nasdaq fell 1.9%, the S&P 500 lost 1.1%, and the Dow slipped 0.7% as investors dumped major tech names. Nvidia crashed over 4%, breaking below its 50-day line after the US blocked AI chip sales to China, while Palantir slid 1.2% on heavy volume. Consumer sentiment dropped to 50.3, inflation expectations rose to 4.7%, and analysts warned a deeper market correction could follow if the AI-led rally keeps unraveling.

Title: 'Big Short' Michael Burry's $1bn market crash bet pays off as stocks suffer worst day since Trump's tariff meltdown

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 9:24:26 AM PST by DFG The man who predicted the 2008 financial crash could soon be proven right again. On Tuesday, Michael Burry — who became a household name after predicting the 2008 crash and inspiring the film The Big Short — had wagered more than $1 billion that Wall Street's AI boom will end in tears. Now the cracks are showing. US tech stocks are on track for their worst week since Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs rattled global markets in April. Eight of the most valuable AI-driven companies — among them Nvidia, Meta, Palantir and Oracle — have lost a staggering $1.1 trillion in market value since the end of last week. By midday in New York, The S&P 500 was down 1.2 percent, the Nasdaq 2 percent and the Dow 300 points, or 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq is on course for a 4 percent weekly loss, its sharpest decline since Trump's tariff war years. Burry specifically bet that the value of stock for Nvidia and Palantir — two of the market’s hottest AI plays — would fall, and those two have been hardest hit. Shares of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — tumbled another 4 percent Friday, leaving them down 13 percent for the week. Palantir has plunged 17 percent since Monday, Filings show Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options worth about $900 million against Palantir and $187 million against Nvidia. A put option is a financial bet that pays off if a company's share price falls. CEO Jensen Huang made things worse by admitting that 'China is going to win the AI race.' He later tried to walk back the remark, but investors were already spooked. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

US tech stocks are on track for their worst week since Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs rattled global markets in April. Eight of the most valuable AI-driven companies — among them Nvidia, Meta, Palantir and Oracle — have lost a staggering $1.1 trillion in market value since the end of last week. By midday in New York, The S&P 500 was down 1.2 percent, the Nasdaq 2 percent and the Dow 300 points, or 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq is on course for a 4 percent weekly loss, its sharpest decline since Trump's tariff war years. Burry specifically bet that the value of stock for Nvidia and Palantir — two of the market’s hottest AI plays — would fall, and those two have been hardest hit. Shares of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — tumbled another 4 percent Friday, leaving them down 13 percent for the week. Palantir has plunged 17 percent since Monday, Filings show Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options worth about $900 million against Palantir and $187 million against Nvidia. A put option is a financial bet that pays off if a company's share price falls. CEO Jensen Huang made things worse by admitting that 'China is going to win the AI race.' He later tried to walk back the remark, but investors were already spooked. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

US stock market plunged Friday as panic gripped investors and tech giants led the rout. The Nasdaq sank 1.9%, the S&P 500 fell 1.1%, and the Dow slipped 0.7% as sellers dumped growth stocks.

Consumer sentiment dropped to 50.3 and inflation expectations hit 4.7%, stoking fear of slowdown. Take-Two crashed 9% on a GTA 6 delay, while Expedia jumped 17% on strong earnings. The AI stock bubble may be cracking faster than expected. (Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

US stock market plunged Friday as panic gripped investors and tech giants led the rout. The Nasdaq sank 1.9%, the S&P 500 fell 1.1%, and the Dow slipped 0.7% as sellers dumped growth stocks. Nvidia plunged over 4% after a US ban on AI chip exports to China, while Palantir, Tesla, and SoFi extended steep losses. Consumer sentiment dropped to 50.3 and inflation expectations hit 4.7%, stoking fear of slowdown. Take-Two crashed 9% on a GTA 6 delay, while Expedia jumped 17% on strong earnings. The AI stock bubble may be cracking faster than expected. (Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Title: Retail industry remains one of ‘hardest hit’ from 2025 job cuts
URL: https://www.retaildive.com/news/retail-industry-hardest-hit-2025-job-cuts-layoffs/804999/

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The federal government again did not publish its monthly jobs report, but Challenger, Gray & Christmas data shows another period of high layoffs across sectors. October turned out to be a bleak month for some retail employees who, just ahead of the holidays, found out their roles are being eliminated. It was also a rough month overall, as it marked the highest job cut total in October in more than 20 years. Through the first 10 months of the year, U.S. employers have now cut more than 1 million jobs, according to Challenger, the highest total since 2020. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes.” In retail, October brought on major layoff announcements from some of the industry’s biggest players. Target announced it would cut 1,000 corporate staff and close 800 open roles — representing about 8% of its global headquarters workforce — as part of an effort to streamline its corporate structure. However, the impact is not immediate, with laid off employees receiving pay and benefits until Jan. 3. E-commerce giant Amazon also announced it would cut about 14,000 corporate roles and will offer most employees 90 days to find a new position internally, if they wish to. Additionally, Puma in October revealed it plans to eliminate about 900 more corporate jobs globally and Carter’s said it will lay off about 300 corporate employees by the end of the year. Some retailers are still focused on hiring for the busy holiday season though. For example, Dick’s Sporting Goods is aiming to hire 14,000 associates across its businesses, Amazon will again plan to hire 250,000 workers and Michael's is planning to bring on 10,000 seasonal workers.

Title: Friday Bullet Points More Video Game Endings

Time Published: 2025-11-07T16:15:23Z
Full Content:
And not the good kind. It is Friday and there are some news items that have popped up that I want to notice, even if only in passing. The writing was on the wall for the unloved Tencent MMORPG. I am pretty sure the MMO news sites spent more time trying to cast some spurious unflattering narrative or another about the game than actually seeing it for what it was… another mediocre entry in a very tired niche market. Is that the sun setting over the clouds? Is this MMORPG Elysium? The crime wasn’t cloning or being a throw away title as one columnist kept suggesting. There was nothing intrinsically wrong with it, even if I did not love the control scheme. Rather, it was another failure to read the room, to see that the classic DikuMUD inspired, level grinding MMORPG is dead. Or, if not dead, then stale enough that the odor coming off of the genre suggests death. I haven’t really looked forward to a new fantasy MMORPG in over a decade. Maybe I am jaded… or maybe there has really been nothing new under the sun in the genre for a long, long time. I mean, I have a quote from GDC 2007 that called it almost 20 years ago: …because of WoW, and all the dumb money and all the publisher pressure, there’ll be lots of games that shouldn’t have been MMOs but would have been great boxed products. Lots of publishers are pushing for that subscription pie, but they’ll fail. -Rob Pardo, MMOs Past, Present, and Future Panel at GDC 2007 Some titles are great and thrive as a massive experience. But most don’t. We’ve seen it over and over and over and over again. It isn’t that nobody can beat WoW or that WoW destroyed the genre… it is that replaying the same tropes and mechanics over and over for a couple of decades gets old. Tarisland was a competent recycling of those tired tropes. It did all the things expected of it. In a vacuum where nobody had seen a fantasy MMORPG, it could have been a winner. But we live in the real world where we have seen this model too many times, and the market for that sort of thing isn’t limitless… and was never as big as some suggested. The WoW-killer of myth was never going to be a copy of WoW’s model. Speaking of fantasy MMORPGs and tropes and what not, the Greg Street (formerly Ghostcrawler at Blizzard) and his studio Fantastic Pixel Castle lost its financial support from NetEase and was unable to find any other backers. My tirade above about the staleness of the MMORPG market and the complete failure of anything new in that specific niche to grab an audience and make a strong name for itself in the last decade or so could feed into this. We don’t know what plans they had or if their vision might have broken new ground or just attempted to revisit the same old scenes. Maybe NetEase couldn’t be convinced that there was any “there” there in the studio’s plan. Or maybe investors are skittish about big projects in general. The layoffs do not seem to be slowing down in the video games industry. We just saw Amazon bail out on the idea of any sort of large scale, live service game last week when they found that even their money couldn’t make the genre something it was not. Anyway, the princess that will save us from this was clearly in another castle this time around. EA is out there trying to woo the SEC to allow its board of directors to cash out… because not one of them ever cared a whit about making video games.. by selling the company to the Saudis in a deal that is structured in such a way as to blow up whatever EA was so as to end up with a shell of the former structure. I’ve been over that before in a whole post bidding farewell to EA and whatever it was. Despite having paid off the president by allowing his son-in-law to “broker” the deal for a huge fee, they are going through the motions and pretending somebody might object or try to block the acquisition. But nobody will. The president has put the most grossly incompetent people in charge of every government department to ensure they are only loyal to him and will only do what he says because they are mentally unprepared to do anything else. So the acquisition theater goes on, which included the FAQ that EA sent out to employees with the following entry: That is such a lie that I assume that the lawyer who wrote it was wearing asbestos underwear in order to shield himself from the inevitability of his pants bursting into flames due to the flagrance of the lack of candor being displayed. I mean sure, that first point is technically true, depending on your definition of immediate. EA won’t be driving people into the street with clubs the very moment the deal closes. But the company will be saddled with so much debt that the only reason some people will be kept around is that they probably can’t sell an unstaffed studio to another company. It will be a bloodbath and I will be mightily surprised if the company employs 20% of its current staff a year after the merger is complete. It will, in common with all such mergers and acquisitions, lead to job losses, studio closures, price increases, service reductions, and a variety of other lesser bad outcomes for the consumers, all to make a few individuals incrementally more wealthy and to allow the Saudis to have Madden titles featured at their esports complex in an attempt to put a friendly face on their bloodthirsty dictatorship. When people complain about the problems with late stage capitalism, this is what they are talking about, a situation where billionaires are rewarded for eliminating jobs and screwing over the general public with the full support and assistance of the government they have bought and paid for. My final entry is pretty small potatoes relative to the above. Another EVE Online fan site appears to have fallen over and will likely not be revived. This is a story that will keep repeating itself I am sure. Such sites do not last forever and the game suffers from time to time because CCP leans so hard on the community to fill in the gaps it cannot, or will not, fill itself. The company couldn’t even maintain a wiki about the game after all. In this case it was a simple site that collected the RSS feeds from the now dwindling few bloggers who write about the game and presented them in a few different views as well as a consolidated RSS feed that I run on the side bar of my other blog. It looks like the inner workings of the site gave up the ghost on October 18, after which it collected no more entries. The site only maintained a seven day combined feed, so its unified output dried up a week later. The site was run by Steve Ronouken, or Fuzzy Steve, a long time EVE Online industrialist and a former CSM member. Judging from his blog he hasn’t been active on the site for a few years. Something changed in the background or got updated and things broke I guess. The funny thing is that a dozen years ago there was a fight over who would host the site and claim the name when Marc Scaurus decided to step down from running his iteration of the site. There was community drama and name calling as two sides struggled to claim the EVE Bloggers name. Now none of the sites I mentioned in that post are up and running… except for Foo’s EVE Blogroll. We still have that at least. The site was never a huge source of traffic here or at my other site, but it was often a quality source, bringing people in already keen on the game. So it goes. Addendum: Oh, and a Warhammer MMO was cancelled as well. Re: Fantastic Pixel Castle, Josh Strife Hayes had a video a couple of months ago about him being invited to the pre-alpha of their MMO and he was entirely whelmed. Obviously it was early days, but it didn’t really look like they had a strong, coherent vision for their product (yet). LikeLike Yeah, I could see that. As soon as you start framing it up as an MMORPG or something adjacent, you get roped into a lot of assumptions, and building something out in a pre-Alpha state that speaks to the vision is difficult. LikeLike I expect EA to simply pump out annual FIFA and Madden updates, utilizing AI for all of the data (and the QA/QC work), and get rid of everything else. Okay, maybe throw The Sims a bone and have a few addons there too, but I’d also see The Sims more “aligned” with Saudi “sensibilities”. Everything else? Pretty much gone. The thing is, boardgames saw this already with the Embracer Group fueled buyout of everything under Asmodee’s umbrella. It took about 5-10 years, but all that bloodletting inevitably let to the game developer diaspora creating vibrant new boardgames under independent companies. That’ll happen with video games, but it’ll take a while. LikeLiked by 1 person Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: AMC Networks Sheds 5% Of Global Workforce Via Voluntary Buyouts
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/11/amc-networks-workforce-voluntary-buyouts-1236610587/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T14:28:30Z
Full Content:
By Dade Hayes Business Editor AMC Networks, which is continuing to navigate the transition from linear TV to streaming, is shedding less than 5% of its global workforce of 1,800 employees via voluntary buyouts. CEO Kristin Dolan announced the reduction Friday during the company’s third-quarter earnings call with Wall Street analysts. The company had earlier reported mixed results for the quarter, with advertising sliding 17% but streaming revenue climbing 14%. In the company’s earnings release, Dolan called the quarterly performance “a key milestone in our transition from a cable networks business to a global streaming and technology focused content company.” Dolan said “less than 5%” of the workforce would be departing as a result of an initiative to “ensure we have the right skills for the future.” She added that company leaders are “thankful for the contributions of those who have chosen to pursue new opportunities, and of course those who are driving this new era of the company.” Watch on Deadline AMC Networks, parent of cable networks AMC, IFC, Sundance TV, We TV and BBC America, also operates a portfolio of niche streaming services AMC+, Shudder and Acorn TV, with a total of 10.4 million subscribers. The downsizing at AMC Networks comes during a much broader pullback across the entertainment sector. Paramount, in the wake of its merger with Skydance, is laying off about 2,000 workers, about 10% of its total head count. Warner Bros. Discovery recently initiated layoffs in its cable business, and is likely to be part of more cutbacks as it nears a transaction to either be acquired or split into two companies. Disney also let several hundred workers go last summer. It isn’t just traditional media tightening the belt, however. Advances in artificial intelligence are resulting in significant cuts even at Big Tech firms. Amazon last month said it was cutting 14,000 corporate employees, including in publishing and video game development. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: ‘Do I need it?’ Groceries cost 20% to 40% more than before the pandemic. How San Diegans are making do

Mike Portal uses a no-fee credit card that gives 6% back on groceries. He pays it off every month. The chicken drumsticks in Chris Lovelace’s freezer cost 99 cents a pound, far cheaper than the red meat he used to buy. Margi Thornburgh, a night owl, checks ads and clips coupons every Wednesday at midnight and hunts for more discounts on store shelves. “I really get a thrill out of getting a bargain,” she said after spotting $1.99 smoothies at Vons recently, down from $3.99. Because they were half off, she bought 12 instead of six. “I was skipping out of the store with a big smile on my face.” These are some of San Diego’s super shoppers, who have been training for this era of fast rising grocery prices for decades. Some have the resources to turn frugal shopping into a sport of sorts — a car that lets them buy in bulk, time to shop for deals, storage space, multiple grocery stores close to home. For others, strapped for space or time, the path to eating adequately while not overspending is more challenging. Grocery prices have risen for a mix of reasons, including pandemic-era supply chain blockages and import tariffs that are passed on to shoppers. In San Diego County, food eaten outside of restaurants cost 4.4% more this July than a year earlier. That is the latest figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose publications stopped due to the federal shutdown. Fresher data — St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s nationwide FRED figures for September — show milk prices were up 10 cents a gallon over last year and up 68 cents over five years earlier, a rise of almost 20%. White bread was down 11 cents from last year but up 38 cents from five years earlier, about 25% higher. Ground beef cost $6.32 a pound, up from $5.67 a year ago and $4.08 in 2020. In the San Diego metro area, meat was 41% higher last month than in October 2019, dairy was 27% higher and produce was 18% higher, according to a grocery price index by Datasembly, a market analytics company that tracks prices of 1,000 products weekly across the United States. Local prices of meat and non-alcoholic beverages kept rising in the past six months, produce is almost even, and dairy and bakery items have fallen slightly, Datasembly found. Faced with these higher prices, San Diegans have changed how they plan and eat. They are abandoning foods and replacing stores they shopped at for decades with ones that have sales and coupons. They’re clinging to a few favorite items — Diet Coke, Diet Snapple, eggs and bourbon were mentioned. But they’re giving up a degree of control, opting to eat what’s on sale and not what they’re craving. They’re doing the math: if I spend this much on gas to drive around or spring for a freezer, but I save that much on food, is it worth it? As a teenager, Thornburgh learned to write grocery lists and shop weekly sales. Some 50 years later, she still uses those methods. But as local food prices have risen, outpacing the national inflation rate, Thornburgh has taken things further, combining every strategy she can think of so she doesn’t spend more than she must. “I look at all the ads either through the emails I receive or directly on the apps. I make my list by store of which items that I want to purchase. … I’m able to shop at multiple stores in one trip. I always bring a cooler to store cold and frozen items,” she outlined in an email to The San Diego Union-Tribune. Strolling through aisles, she keeps looking for deals. “I can be in a store, see an item on the shelf, and I will pull up the Target app, the Walmart app, the Food 4 Less app,” she said. “Any app of the store that I’m not in. And I will look for the price … and I will say, ‘Am I going to buy this here or am I going to go to another store?’” Her weekly grocery loop is time intensive, taking 90 minutes to two hours and covering as much as seven miles. Stops include Walmart, Food 4 less, Trader Joe’s and Vons. She recently folded in Aldi, drawn by an ad for 55-cent avocados. She picked those up, plus raspberries and asparagus, all on sale. Thornburgh, 70, gets income from contract sewing and Social Security. She is not among the 53% of adults who, according to a poll by AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, see grocery expenses as a “major source of stress.” (Groceries beat housing and health care costs and having inadequate savings or income as the top financial worry.) “I feel that I’m skilled enough and take advantage of all the tools out there,” she said. “I don’t feel stressed. But I’m very conscientious.” She reminds her husband: “If it’s not on sale, I’m not buying it. So he was really happy this week when Ding Dongs were on sale.” With these efforts, she spends around $100 a week, up from $60 before the pandemic, and saves around 50% on average at Vons and 40% at Food 4 Less. “With the money I save, it’s worth the investment of time,” she said. Thornburgh offered one more hint: don’t just shop online. Go inside stores. She acknowledged that shopping online and picking up groceries is convenient for some people, including parents of young children, but “you will miss the in-store sales, and sometimes those are substantial.” Jeff Lonsdale, Ken Sobel and Chris Lovelace are cutting back on red meat. “I don’t buy steaks anymore,” said Lonsdale, 68, who lives in a mobile retirement community in Oceanside. A half-package of sirloin burgers from Costco has been sitting in his freezer because he has “better, more affordable choices” today. He used to buy what he wanted, but as his income as a contract circuit designer fell and food prices hit new highs — especially for the beef burgers, steaks and pork chops he once enjoyed — he has changed his habits. “It used to be: I want it, I’ll go get it. Now I think, do I need it? Then maybe I go get it,” he said. “I don’t need doughnuts and cakes and desserts and that kind of thing, so I don’t even bother.” Currently, he said, “my income is short of expenses each month. My savings account keeps me above water.” Worried about cash flow, Lonsdale started tracking all food spending this year — both at stores and the occasional trip to Taco Bell. All together, his monthly spending on food is around $65 this year, he said. A food rescue program he visits three times a week helps him hold down costs, bringing surplus items from local grocery stores to his community. Around 40 people visit each time, he estimated. One recent morning, he picked up seafood salad with crackers, a 12-ounce watermelon cup, two mesquite-seasoned pork chops that totaled 12 ounces, an Earthbound Farms brand veggie tray with ranch dip, baby carrots, broccoli and celery, a Nathan’s hot dog and a 6-ounce Caesar salad. Based on the price tags he saw, he said the total might be around $20. “I mean, would you spend $3.99 for a little tray of cut up watermelon?” he said. “I get it for free and I’m loving it. And it’s not just the volume. It’s the variety. Things I have never thought about trying, never knew they had, wouldn’t have looked for.” Another nice surprise: goat cheese with herbs. “Wow, I’ll try that. It’s free. It was good.” Sobel, 71, who lives in La Jolla, cut out most meat and some other high-cost grocery items. “Sticker shock was a huge part of it — the prices that went higher all the time and the quality going down, almost commensurately,” he said. “That brought my focus back into buying only healthy foods, buying only what I’m going to eat, being careful about our choices.” After a hospitalization, Sobel decided to lose weight. He changed his diet in June and stopped buying “a lot of the high-price, mass-produced snack foods … that have skyrocketed in price.” One more change: “I really don’t throw away food anymore.” He makes a chef salad using turkey breast or sliced ham and eats that several days in a row, “until it’s completely gone.” “I’m lucky enough to be able to cut about 40% from my food budget and afford to eat,” added Sobel, who reduced his household’s average monthly grocery bill from around $550 (not counting the occasional restaurant delivery) before June to around $400 now. “But what about kids and seniors and low-income families who are losing their SNAP benefits?” Almost 400,000 San Diego County residents saw their CalFresh benefits — the state’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — halted Nov. 1 amid a federal government shutdown, now in its sixth week. Federal judges later ordered that funds be restarted. Between workers whose pay was frozen by the federal shutdown and people whose food benefits were postponed or trimmed, demand is surging at food banks and food-rescue nonprofits, whether in small communities like Lonsdale’s or at large distribution centers. In Encinitas, Lovelace rarely buys red meat at the store anymore. Instead, he goes out for quality burgers. “It’s got really, really good meat,” he said of Versailles Cafe’s $18 cheeseburger and fries. “It’s a real half pound, not a seven ouncer.” Lovelace’s rooftop solar on the house he and his wife, Dana, bought almost 50 years ago powers the two chest freezers he keeps in his garage. “I still don’t have any chicken breast in my freezer that I paid over $2 a pound for,” he said. Bacon was purchased at $4 a pound — around half of what it costs now full price. He is still working through the dozen packages of breakfast sausage he bought at half-off a while back. When he shops, he buys enough meat to last until the next big sale. Lovelace, who is 75 and retired, stopped shopping at stores that don’t send weekly ads. Like Thornburgh, he lives in a grocery-dense neighborhood with “all the big chains, so it’s really easy to get to places.” He focuses on house brands over pricier, name-brand versions. In-season food is also cheaper, he added. And he knows the market. “You have to know your prices. Sometimes that good deal really isn’t,” he said. These efforts are keeping the couple’s grocery costs almost even with last year: $560 a month in 2023 and 2024 and $577 this year, on average. “Doubtless expenses will begin to rise this holiday season as we liquidate our older inventories but we’ll still be kicking butt on money spent for food compared to any of my friends or neighbors when we compare notes on this topic,” Lovelace wrote in an email. He also credited his wife, who embraces his “cheapo philosophy.” In Mt. Helix, Portal is back to shopping like he did when he was a newlywed in the early 1990s — only now he has that cash-back credit card. “I was in the beginning of my career,” he said of his frugal youth. “We chose to have my wife stay home and take care of the babies. So, yeah, we pinched pennies and cut corners to save money.” Now his kids have kids and Portal, 65, has a home on Mt. Helix and a mortgage consulting business. But with the “tremendous increase in food costs” he has observed this year, he buys food on sale and stopped shopping at Whole Foods. “It’s just too high.” His small freezer holds berries bought on sale, which his toddler grandchildren devour. He also buys discounted meat and uses a vacuum sealer to avoid freezer burn. Ribeye on sale rose from $6 a pound to $9 or more, but even that is a relative bargain compared to full price, he said. Uncooked beef steaks cost on average $10.88 a pound last September and $12.26 this September, up from $8.13 five years ago, according to St. Louis Fed FRED data. To keep grocery expenses roughly the same as last year, even while springing for steak — and the chicken he cooks for RiRi, his 13-year-old Labrador pitbull mix — Portal and his wife stock up ahead of big holidays, when sales are “the best.” He gushed about his credit card, an American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card. Never carrying a balance is key, he said. Portal pointed value hunters to GTM Discount General Store, a surplus seller whose weekly sale recently featured 50% off Eddie Bauer sweatshirts, 40% off flood lightbulbs and 40% off spring wreaths. It has great deals on food, Portal added. Lovelace said he’s lucky to have two freezers and the garage shelves he built himself. “We have places to put stuff, and some people don’t. A lot of the things we do don’t apply across the board.” But his approach of stocking up when prices drop has worked across his lifetime. “In any given era, the same rule applies: prices on food have not gone down realistically over any real period of time in my lifetime. Little dips down and big jumps up,” he said.

Title: October Layoffs Were the Worst Since 2003 and Hit Tech Workers Hard

Reading time 2 minutes A lot of people can feel that the economy isn’t doing so hot right now. Unfortunately, due to the government shutdown, we don’t have much in the way of official economic data to give statistical clarity to that feeling. However, more and more, private firms are releasing their economic analysis, and, much of the time, it doesn’t bode well for the American worker. Now, a new report shows that this October was a particularly brutal month for the U.S. workforce—and it was especially bad for the tech industry. The analysis, from career transition services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, shows that this past month was the worst in decades. The report states that U.S. employers announced some “153,074 job cuts in October, up 175% from the 55,597 cuts announced in October 2024. It is up 183% from the 54,064 job cuts announced one month prior.” Yikes, that’s a lot. And the cuts have been especially deep for Silicon Valley: Technology continues to lead in private-sector job cuts as companies restructure amid AI integration, slower demand, and efficiency pressures. In October, the sector announced 33,281 job cuts, up sharply from 5,639 in September. For the year, Technology firms have announced 141,159 job cuts, up 17% from the 120,470 announced through the same period in 2024. Yeah, that’s bad. That is not good at all. There’s no real way to spin that as good. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” the report states. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape.” “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month. Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” We’ve already written about the huge layoffs that impacted the tech industry last month—including some 14,000 people who used to be (but are no longer) employed with Amazon. The exact reason for why tech companies are shedding jobs right now is still up in the air. One narrative attributes the layoffs to the rise of AI, but other commentators have noted that it could be much more mundane economic/business factors that are squeezing the industry like a lack of growth in non-AI sectors and tariff policy eating away at profits while making it difficult to plan for the future.

Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture. Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. It all began with an anonymous Twitter handle named “Ivan the K.” The self-appointed “Lead Independent Director of Finance Twitter” had a dark theory in the depths of the pandemic. In 2020, they asked the universe, “Why is no one talking about a K recovery?” since there was much discussion at that time about an economic bounceback in the shape of either a U, an L, or, most bullish of all, a V. “Some things will bounce back,” Ivan wrote, “some will not recover. Think about it.” Economists seem to have thunk on it and agreed: The K is real. It bears similarities to another saying, invented nearly 200 years earlier by the great English romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley: “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.” This is also called “the Matthew effect,” as some trace the sentiment all the way back to the bible’s Book of Matthew 25:29: “For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.” If you ask Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, this old-time religion got a new lease on life in the Reaganomics of the 1980s. “You really start to see this in the Reagan era,” Zandi told Fortune. “That’s when you get a structural divergence between productivity growth and median wage growth.” Zandi argued that many elements combined then to weaken labor in favor of capital income: globalization, the decline of unions and manufacturing and major tax reforms. “The share of national income going to labor has been trending down since the early 1980s,” he said, “and the share going to capital owners—those who already have wealth—has gone up.” So what is it about 2025, five years after the pandemic severed something economically, that accelerated both sides of the “K” for the wealthy and the poor? First, consider the extraordinary surges in economic data seen, halfway through the 2020s. The stock market rallies have led to several record highs in 2025, incentivizing the (wealthier) Americans with money in the markets to loosen their purse strings. But the bottom half of the K is extending downwards, with fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and Cava, and fast-food joints like McDonald’s, noting that lower-income customers, especially young people, are pulling back and preferring to dine at home. Zandi’s own research has turned up some stunning results, notably that in the second quarter of 2025 the top 10% of wealthiest Americans were responsible for a whopping 49% of consumer spending. That means the economy has grown so lopsided—or K-shaped—that the richest Americans are responsible for half the economy. The K-shape is creating the illusion in economic data that despite sticky inflation and tariff-related sticker shock, consumer spending remains “resilient.” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Lisa Shalett has increasingly been sounding the alarm from her perch as chief investment officer. She told Fortune in an October interview that “the income inequality stuff is really getting like completely wackadoo,” specifically citing Zandi’s research: “That means 90% of the country is only half the consumption, I mean holy cannoli.” Shalett covered the K-shaped economy specifically in a November 3 research note, in the context of whether 2026 marks an early or late stage of the economic cycle for investors. “Decoding this conundrum may hinge on the so-called K-shaped economy,” she wrote, “a concept that captures the widening chasm between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots.’” Then Shalett said the situation is actually even worse than what Zandi produced: “For the U.S. consumer, wealth concentration has produced a situation where the top 40% of households by income account for approximately 60% of all spending; those households, in turn, control nearly 85% of America’s wealth, two-thirds of which is directly tied to the stock market, which has climbed more than 90% in three years.” She calculated that spending by the wealthiest households was growing 6x-7x faster than for the lowest cohort. Even Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell talked about seeing the pattern at October’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “If you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big, public, consumer-facing companies, many of them are saying that there’s a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower cost products,” Powell said last week. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.” The concept of a bifurcated economy has been baked into American society longer than even the days of Reagan, according to Tyler Schipper, associate professor of economics at the University of St. Thomas. “There’s this underlying thing that has been true for decades and decades and decades,” Schipper told Fortune. “Number one, lower income households always struggle more in the economy. They tend to be more impacted by price changes because they’re spending a higher percentage of their income. “And second, that it tends to be that after each recession, lower income workers fall further behind in the income distribution,” he added. Today, conversations around the shape of the American economy are more urgent because more of the middle class—and those making about $100,000 per year—are getting pushed into the lower half of the K, Schipper said. This can be seen in mid-income and higher-income earners flocking to discount retailers like Walmart and Dollar General. It can even take on more absurd forms, with “Ralph Lauren Christmas” trending at unprecedented levels heading into the projected $1 trillion 2025 holiday season, but TikTok and Instagram full of tips on how to achieve the look of red-tartan-plaid and cozy sweaters on a budget—in other words, not at an actually expensive Ralph Lauren store. That lower half of the K is extending ever downward as the consumer encounters a unique set of challenges, including the inflationary impact of tariffs, according to Schipper. Lower-income households tend to spend more on essential goods more likely to be impacted by tariffs. The Yale Budget Lab calculated that the levies impact the bottom of the income ladder more than three times more than the top. A low-fire, low-hire labor market has also contributed to evidence of a two-tiered economy, said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Federal Reserve economist. While tech layoffs have been top of mind following massive cuts from Amazon, layoff rates are still low, Sahm told Fortune, meaning if you have a job, you may feel more financially secure. If you’re just entering the job market like Gen Z is, you may have a hard time finding a job as firms contract following a post-COVID hiring spree, and as AI begins to displace entry-level jobs. To be sure, data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas released on Thursday found U.S. employers cut more than 150,000 jobs last month, the largest October reduction in two decades. But another part of the resurgence of discussions about a bifurcated economy comes from the relative nature of a K-shaped economy, according to Schipper. While the economy has historically been two-tiered, diverging consumer sentiment has also contributed to a narrative that two income groups are moving away from each other. For example, in 2022 when the stock market declined, consumer sentiment in both the top-third and bottom-third of income levels converged, according to data from the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers. A similar pattern occurred in April, when the announcement of Liberation Day tariffs spooked Americans across income levels, Schipper noted. Last month, however, consumer attitude toward the economy saw a greater split, with low-income Americans feeling far less confident about the economy than those high-income. Some economists point to the widening divide between the rich and the poor as a consequence of monetary policy. The Fed, over the past few years, has had a historic tightening cycle – eleven rate hikes between 2022 and 2024—which was meant to pare down inflation. However, it also reinforced the split since wealthy households, flush by years of asset appreciation, could weather the slowdown better than lower income households facing higher mortgage rates and shrinking credit, Zandi said. Cheap money in the 2010s and early pandemic years boosted stocks and home values, but the 2022-and-on tightening squeezed borrowers and renters without necessarily reversing those gains. That means even as inflation has cooled, the damage lingered as asset holders retained their windfall but wage earners bore the brunt of disinflation. “Folks in the top third of the income and wealth distribution are doing well, but the remaining two-thirds of Americans are struggling… they borrowed during the pandemic when rates were low, and now they’re having to pay on that debt at a higher rate,” Zandi said. Though Fed chair Powell has acknowledged today’s K-shaped economy, a restrictive monetary policy is helping keep it in place, Sahm argued, making it unlikely for the two diverging K lines to come any closer together. “We have a Fed that’s still trying to fight inflation that’s been elevated, and part of the tool that they have for fighting inflation is interest rates are elevated, and they’ve been elevated for some time,” Sahm said. “This is the way restrictive monetary policy works: It’s going to hit households hardest who are more financially constrained.” Zandi had a different perspective. He argued that the gap will require policy changes far beyond the Fed’s remit. “The Fed can’t fix the K-shaped economy,” he said. “It can only stabilize prices and employment. The distributional effects are up to fiscal policy.” Instead, Zandi argued for a reversal of some choices made on the fiscal side that would “do no harm” to lower-and-middle-income Americans. “Don’t impose tariffs—that exacerbates inequality,” he said. “Lower- and middle-income households spend a much higher share of their budget on imported products like food, clothing, and cars.” He also criticized President Donald Trump’s “highly restrictive” immigration policy, which he said hurts jobs for industries that rely on immigrants, such as construction, agriculture and manufacturing broadly. Beyond just addressing self-inflicting wounds, Zandi argued that progress depends on both structural and cyclical forces: raising productivity through education, broad-based jobs creation, and ensuring that gains from AI will be equally shared. “If the benefits of AI are distributed more broadly,” he said, “and if job losses are offset by new opportunities, we’ll be fine.” Clear evidence of a two-tiered economy doesn’t mean a recession is imminent, economists said. It does, however, mean that if economic indicators were to take a nosedive, the risk of a recession would increase. “The K-shaped economy, the bifurcated economy, is potentially a more vulnerable economy,” Sahm said. Though layoff rates are still relatively low, if the rate of job cuts increased, there would be many more people in a job market where there’s not much hiring. The labor market today doesn’t look like it did in the job-hopping era of 2023, even when interest rates were still high, Sahm noted.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning and welcome to First Trade. It's no-Jobs Friday! Thanks to the government shutdown, we won't get new employment data. But don't worry, we have you covered with a roundup of private figures. Rundown But first, let's get in touch with the populace. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings Earnings season has been good. Perhaps… too good. The run-ups in the stock market's favorite tech darlings after earnings last week apparently pushed valuations to a point where investors decided they'd had enough. It's led to a chaotic current week, with two separate valuation-driven sell-offs in a matter of three days. The institutional class is as split as ever over what the future holds. JPMorgan is recommending investors buy any dips. Billionaire Ray Dalio sees a short-term rally, and then a Fed-driven sell-off. And then there's the overhang of what will happen with President Trump's tariffs, which are facing a prolonged legal battle. But that only tells part of the story. As retail investing has exploded in popularity, so has the influence of the day-traders populating Reddit and Discord forums. Their behavior can often be a harbinger of what's to come, and the strategy team JPMorgan has conveniently been keeping tabs. Here are the four main themes that have dominated retail trading over the past week as volatility has raged. They went on their biggest buying spree in four months, almost entirely in mega-cap tech But they're not blindly buying market dips They're getting tired of gold and bitcoin after torrid rallies They're most excited about these meme stocks Judging by a "social interest score" tracked by JPMorgan, the "most hyped" stocks this past week were: Beyond Meat, Nokia, POET Technologies, UiPath, Palantir, Nvidia, Chipotle, and Reddit. Are you a retail investor that's leaning into these trends, or doing something completely different? Let us know what portfolio moves you've been making at firsttrade@businessinsider.com. On the heels of another difficult day in the market, console yourself with another example of the value-creating impact of AI deals. Snap stock surged as much as 18% after announcing a $400 million partnership with Perplexity AI, to incorporate its AI search engine into Snapchat. It's a good reminder that — even on the toughest of days — AI deals trump all, and can carry a stock to market-beating performance. Is the gig up for gold? At least as an S&P 500-crushing speculative asset? It appears so. Following a 20% run up through September and into October, the price of the precious metal has come back down to earth. The chart above, from JPMorgan, reflects a corresponding shift in sentiment, specifically among retail investors. Note the blue line, which shows that retail buying has plateaued. Each Friday, I'll discuss and review a piece of markets- or finance-related media: movies, books, TV shows, podcasts, etc. Today's entry is the movie "Boiler Room" (2000). There are some quotes at the beginning of "Boiler Room" — namely "I just want to get in" and "nobody wants to work for it anymore" — that echo the frivolous, fundamental-lite stock market activity that characterized the meme stock era. Right away, you know this is a movie that's going to deal with a popular evergreen theme: how to get rich quick. This film is best approached by suspending belief around the illegalities occurring. The schemes are sub-Wolf-of-Wall-Street penny-stock pump and dumps, where the companies don't even exist. It would never happen, at least this flagrantly, but that's not the point. It's all merely a vessel for the movie's top-notch cast of wisecracking early-2000s actors masquerading as stock-brokers. Vin Diesel executes a pitch-perfect sales call in front of 100 associates, closing the deal to rapt applause. Ben Affleck — the firm's head recruiter — delivers two scintillating motivational monologues to a room full of new hires. Key quote: "Anybody who tells you that money is the root of all evil, doesn't f**king have any." Leading man Giovanni Ribisi excels as a whip-smart, money-hungry youngster who's looking to make the leap from backroom poker games to stock-broking millionaire. And it feels like Jamie Kennedy is acting in a different movie — perhaps channeling his "Malibu's Most Wanted" character at some points — but it doesn't matter, he steals every scene he's in. At one point, the core group of brokers sit around trading extended recitations of the original "Wall Street." There's an analogy in there somewhere. Of course, the movie doesn't take place exclusively within the walls of the Long Island-based JT Marlin (yes, it's that obvious of a play on JPMorgan). The crew ventures into NYC a handful of times to beat up rival brokers from the "real" Wall Street, and party at a hotel in celebration of a new (fraudulent) IPO launch. These are electric and hilarious scenes, and they show that the movie is at its strongest when the core cast is ripping it up, even if a lot of the dialogue is offensive enough to be left in the year 2000. It's not the best finance movie of all time. But, for my money, it's the most fun. And for that reason it gets a 10/10 rating. Do you have any ideas about what I should review next?

Title: You can’t sit down! Peloton warns 900,000 customers to stop using bikes following reports of seat posts breaking and falling off

Like this site? Help us to make it better. We’re not sure if anyone working at Peloton is a fan of early 60s doo-wop group The Dovells. But if they are, the American band’s 1963 hit ‘You Can’t Sit Down’ would form a rather apt soundtrack for the fitness brand’s offices this week. On Thursday, Peloton issued a voluntary recall notice for almost 900,000 of its Original Series Bike+ models, following reports of a seat post defect which causes it to break and fall off, potentially resulting in, the company says, “injury risk” for users. Peloton has received three reports of the seat posts breaking and detaching during use, and two reports of injuries as a result of falls. Approximately 833,000 models have since been recalled in the US, while 44,800 bikes sold in Canada may also be affected, though Peloton says it is yet to receive any reports of seat posts breaking from its Canadian customers. The American company has warned users affected by the recall to stop using the Original Series Bike+ model immediately, while offering customers a free replacement seat post, which can be self-installed at home. > Peloton set to charge customers £70 for using second-hand bikes, as brand’s sales finally rise by 0.2%, prompting shares to surge months after large-scale redundancies and restructuring The recall applies to Original Series Bike+ models manufactured in Taiwan between December 2019 and July 2022, which were sold in the United States and Canada from January 2020 to April 2025. The bikes were sold by Peloton directly, as well as through third-party retailers such as eBay, Amazon, and Dick’s Sporting Goods, retailing at $2,495. Peloton says the affected models can be identified by the PL02 model number and a serial number beginning with the letter ‘T’, on the label located inside the front fork, behind the front fork, or behind the flywheel. “The integrity of our products and our members’ well-being are our top priorities,” Marcio Oliveira, Peloton’s senior vice president of Global Hardware Operations and Product Safety, said in a statement. “The recall is due to the fact that the Original Series Bike+ seat post assembly can break during use, posing fall and injury hazards to the user. “Peloton has received three reports of seat posts breaking out of approximately 833,000 units sold in the US. Peloton has received no reports of a seat post breaking, out of 44,800 units sold in Canada. “We are taking this opportunity to make replacement seat posts available to all affected Bike Plus users and we encourage them to contact us to receive the redesigned seat post as soon as possible.” > Peloton reports a defect in its bike seats after users report injuries, also announces ninth straight quarter of loss This latest recall comes over two years after Peloton issued an even larger recall notice concerning a faulty seat post, following the indentation of a defect in its Original Series PL-01 model, affecting 2.2 million of its entry-level bikes. That recall, issued in May 2023, came after 35 reports from users that the seat post was vulnerable to breaking at the weld joint, leading to 13 injuries, one customer sustaining a fractured wrist, cuts, and bruises. Last year, we reported that, after a turbulent period characterised by restructuring, a curtailed retailed presence, and a series of layoffs, Peloton saw its first sales increase in nine quarters, beating analysts’ estimates and sending shares surging as much as 41 per cent. That rare bit of positive news came as the American fitness company controversially confirmed that it will start charging customers a £72 “activation fee” when they buy one of their exercise bikes second-hand. In May 2024, at the same time CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down, 15 per cent of Peloton’s workforce (around 400 people) was made redundant in another round of cuts. This latest cull, McCarthy claimed, was necessary to bring the New York-based brand’s spending in line with its revenue, following three years of continuous losses thanks to sales of connected indoor fitness equipment plummeting as Covid-era restrictions eased.

Title: They got laid off from the Microsoft country club and dumped into a hellish job market

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After 31 years at Microsoft, Mike Kostersitz never saw it coming. In May, his team met with a senior leader about a new product. "Everybody was happy with the progress," said Kostersitz, then a principal product manager lead working on Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure. "Everything was peachy." The following morning, he noticed a high-priority virtual meeting had been added to his calendar — and it wasn't good news. "Me and 120 other anonymous faces got told our jobs had been eliminated," said the Washington-based 60-year-old. His manager and two of his direct reports were also among the 6,000 employees affected. In July, roughly 9,000 more were laid off. Previously, in January and February, Microsoft had made nearly 2,000 performance-based cuts. I spoke with seven of the Microsoft workers who lost their jobs over the past 12 months. Microsoft was once known for its "country club" culture, but as Ashley Stewart reported for Business Insider earlier this year, leaders worried the company had gone soft, and it ramped up scrutiny on performance. A Microsoft spokesperson has said that most of this year's cuts were not performance-based but were intended to reduce management layers and streamline operations. Along with Amazon, Meta, and Google, Microsoft is one of many companies — from Silicon Valley to corporate America — that are fueling the Great Flattening. The tenure of the ex-Microsofters I spoke to ranged from a few years to more than three decades. Some said any sense of job security they once had was shattered. Several said they were caught off guard by their layoffs, citing factors like long tenure, no documented performance issues, and Microsoft's position as the world's third-most valuable company. They wondered: If job security is dead at Microsoft, will they find it anywhere else? Kostersitz is one of them. To help with his job search, he said a Microsoft-funded career advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by erasing work done in the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now only shows professional experience since 2003. The advisor also emphasized that today's job market is an endurance test. "They said it's a game of chicken right now," he said. "The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job." Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: The experiences of laid-off Microsoft employees are part of a broader shift in corporate America. As Business Insider's Aki Ito has reported, job security was a defining feature of white-collar work during the postwar boom, a period when layoffs and firings were rare. However, globalization — and the overseas competition that accompanied it — gave rise to a new management philosophy focused on cost-cutting, downsizing, and viewing employees as interchangeable. It's not just about flattening. In cuts this year, companies have cited AI — if not directly for taking jobs, then for creating an environment in which companies can operate with leaner staff. It's what workers have been fearing will happen on a large scale as AI continues to improve and become increasingly omnipresent. While Microsoft's culture has evolved over the years, some laid-off employees said they believe the recent cuts show the company has entered a new era — one where avoiding layoffs appears to be a lower priority. The former Microsoft employees, in addition to dozens of other laid-off workers I've spoken with over the past year, told me they are grappling with how to protect their careers and financial well-being after an unexpected chop. Before Eduardo Noriega was laid off by Microsoft in May, he'd been nervous about his job security since 2009, when the company cut about 5,000 workers. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle. After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a side business he could rely on if he ever lost his job. By the time he was cut in May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit Microsoft and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." For other workers across corporate America, the challenge of landing a new role in today's economy has upped the stakes of sudden unemployment. While layoffs across the broader economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar roles have been particularly vulnerable. At the same time, US businesses are hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013. "If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job," said Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, she said, the shift may feel especially stark. Ian Carter began working at Microsoft in 2021, and he said the company's layoffs in 2023 and 2024 sent a clear message: His job wasn't safe. "It felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not," said the 33-year-old. "Everybody was at risk." Since being laid off in May from his position as a technical program manager, he has struggled to find a job. He drew on savings for several months to cover expenses and switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment — crossing his fingers that he'd land something soon. But he never did. In late October, he stored his belongings and moved to Florida to live with his family and save money while continuing his search. "Rent is expensive," he said, "but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive." In May, Joe Friend learned that he and 14 other members of his working group had been laid off. Friend's tenure at Microsoft spanned more than two decades across three stints, but this was the first time he hadn't left by choice. Friend said he believes there's been a culture shift within Microsoft — one that's left employees with less job security than they once had. Some of his concerns extend beyond Microsoft to Big Tech more broadly — which is why he plans to be highly selective about his next role. "I think I'd rather earn $50,000 a year doing something I'm excited about," said the 62-year-old. "It doesn't mean I won't jump back into a job, but it certainly won't be Big Tech." Deborah Hendersen took a different approach. After 14 years at Microsoft, Hendersen, a user researcher in the company's Xbox division, was one of about 9,000 employees laid off in July. "It wasn't so much like watching a car wreck," said the 45-year-old, who lives in Seattle. "It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck." The moment she received a mysterious meeting invite that she suspected would bring bad news, she began laying the groundwork for her future. She shared a message internally and on LinkedIn to tell her network that she'd been laid off and to learn who else had been affected. This led to the creation of a Discord chat of more than a dozen affected colleagues, where people shared job opportunities, helped each other prepare for interviews, vented their frustrations, and celebrated their successes. Hendersen also turned to her network to find openings and secure referrals. One of the roles recommended to her was a user experience researcher position at Meta. She received a referral and, in late August, a job offer. Hendersen credited her network — and in particular her laid-off colleagues — for supporting her during this challenging period. "It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows," she said. "Because everybody gets turned down, gets their hopes up, and is just figuring out how to remain sane in a really challenging time." Jump to

Title: Is the job market getting worse? As the shutdown continues, this is what we know

Scott Horsley The government shutdown has delayed a report on the October job market. That leaves policymakers looking for other signals about the pace of hiring and firing. Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America hide caption The government shutdown is again making it it hard to answer a critical question: How is the U.S. job market doing? The impasse in Congress over funding has delayed a closely-watched report on the labor market for the second month in a row. Without that official jobs tally, the available signals are mixed. This week, a big payroll processing company reported an uptick in October hiring, for example. But a consulting firm that tracks pink slips noted a big surge in layoff notices. Policymakers typically look to monthly surveys from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the broadest and most accurate snapshot of the job market. But BLS number-crunchers have been furloughed for more than five weeks, so the September and October jobs reports have not been published. "Due to the government shutdown, this is a challenging time to give an economic outlook speech," Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook told an audience at the Brookings Institution on Monday. "The longer the shutdown lasts, the more data could be disrupted." But Cook insisted she and her colleagues are not "flying blind." They look to private-sector data for signals about hiring and firing, as well as anecdotal reports from a wide range of business contacts. Workers and people looking for work do the same, as they form their own impressions of the job market — and there are signs of concern. A measure of employee sentiment from the job-search website Glassdoor found workers are less confident about the availability of jobs now than they've been in the last three months. Glassdoor users who received a job offer in October were less likely to turn it down than the previous month, suggesting that workers feel they have less leverage in the current market. "October's decline in employee confidence reflects how quickly economic uncertainty can ripple through the workforce," said Glassdoor's chief economist Daniel Zhao. "The government shutdown and mounting layoff fears have clearly shaken employee sentiment." A number of high-profile companies such as Amazon and UPS have announced widespread layoffs in recent weeks, which likely weighs on workers' confidence. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says U.S. businesses announced plans to cut 153,074 jobs last month — the worst October in more than two decades. Tech firms and warehousing companies reported some of the biggest downsizing plans. "Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market," says Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer at the firm. State tallies of new unemployment claims have remained relatively stable, however, suggesting that there hasn't been a big spike in overall layoffs yet. On the positive side, ADP, which handles payroll for more than 26 million U.S. employees, says it counted an increase in the number of private-sector employees last month, after two months of decline. "Private employers added jobs in October for the first time since July," says ADP's chief economist Nela Richardson. At the same time, Richardson notes that "hiring was modest relative to what we reported earlier this year." A recruiter speaks with job seekers at a job fair held in Sunrise, Fl., on Sept. 25, 2025. Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America hide caption Official data from the BLS had also shown a slowdown in hiring during the summer, before the government shutdown halted its reporting. Employers added just 22,000 jobs in August — the last month for which official numbers are available. Some of the drop in job growth could be the result of having fewer available workers. Some 10,000 baby boomers retire every day. And the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement likely means there are fewer foreign-born workers in the job market. While the unemployment rate inched up to 4.3% in August, that's still quite low by historical standards. "The slightly rising unemployment rate indicates the labor market is softening, but only modestly so," Cook said Monday. She cautioned however that unemployment rates for young and African American workers jumped more sharply over the summer, which could be a warning sign. The jobless rate for workers aged 20-24 in August was 9.2% while the unemployment rate among African Americans was 7.5%. "This is sometimes called a "two-speed" economy," Cook said, "when the well-off are doing well, while [lower-income families] and vulnerable households are not." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: The Vulnerability of Forests to Natural Disturbances
URL: https://agriculture.gouv.fr/vulnerability-forests-natural-disturbances
Time Published: 2025-11-07T09:54:24Z
Full Content:
Ministèrede l'Agriculture,de l'Agro-Alimentaireet de la Souverainetéalimentaire 07 novembre 2025 Info + Partager la page Sommaire The Analysis Notes present, in four pages, the main points of discussion on a current topic relevant to the areas of activity of the Department of Agriculture, Agri-Food, and Food Sovereignty. Depending on the topic, they take a forward-looking, strategic, or evaluative approach. Analysis n°224 Forests are increasingly threatened by natural disturbances, which are being exacerbated by climate change. This note explores the growing risks that will emerge in the future. It details several vulnerability factors and the associated environmental and economic impacts. In an uncertain context, understanding the interplay between the various components of risk makes it possible to prioritise actions that can mitigate it. Proactive management of forest fuel or the recovery of storm-damaged timber, for instance, are measures that can help address this challenge. Forests are affected by so-called “natural” disturbances, whether biotic (e.g. pathogens) or abiotic (e.g. fires). Their occurrence may nevertheless be of anthropogenic origin, as is the case for the majority of fires in France. Climate change intensifies these disturbances and places an increasing threat on the functions of forests: timber production, carbon sequestration, biodiversity reservoir, etc. The recent multiplication of extreme events, such as the fires in France during the summer of 2022 or the wildfire events that devastated forests in the Aude department in August 2025, has heightened the visibility of these disturbances in public debate. Awareness has also grown of their role in the decline of the land carbon sink1. The concepts associated with the notion of “risk” are numerous, each carrying a specific meaning. This note clarifies the constituent elements of the risks generated by natural disturbances in forests and illustrates them with concrete cases concerning Europe (including France) and the United States. The first part defines the components of risk (hazard, asset, vulnerability) and presents trends of the future evolution of hazards for the main disturbance agents. The second part reviews some of the environmental and economic consequences of current and future disturbances. Finally, examples of practices to reduce vulnerability through forest management or organisational solutions are described. Risk is a polysemous term, defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the potential for adverse consequences for a system to which certain values and objectives are attached2. It is a composite notion, resulting from the encounter of three components: a hazard, an element exposed to that hazard (or asset), and its vulnerability. The hazard corresponds to the physical phenomenon capable of causing harm. The notion covers both the characteristics of the event (e.g. wind speed, burnt area) and its probability of occurrence. Hazards that correspond to punctual events (e.g. fire, storm) cause catastrophic mortality, i.e. sudden and massive, in forest stands. Others have more diffuse impacts, such as droughts, which correspond to periods of thermal and/or rainfall anomalies compared to past references. The exposed element here is the forest ecosystem, which possesses use and non-use values for society and provides ecosystem services (e.g. timber production, landscape amenities). The asset corresponds to the proper ecosystem functioning of the forest. Independently of its degree of exposure, i.e. presence in a given area, a forest is characterised by a certain level of vulnerability, meaning a predisposition to being negatively impacted. It may be vulnerable due to its predisposition to damage (sensitivity) or its limited ability to adjust to and recover from damage (adaptive capacity). Figure 1 – Breakdown of the concept of risk Ce schéma montre que le risque émerge à l’intersection de trois notions : l’aléa, l’exposition et la vulnérabilité. This diagram visually represents that risk emerges at the intersection of three notions: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Reading: risk emerges from the encounter of a hazard that affects an exposed element characterised by a certain level of vulnerability. Source : IPCC, 2022, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Vulnerability may be intrinsic, linked to the physiological traits of trees, the composition and structure of stands, etc.3. For instance, some species are more resistant to fires due to thicker bark, or better adapted to rapid recovery, by resprouting (e.g. oaks) or via seed banks (e.g. Aleppo pine). Conversely, a forest with a high presence of fuel (e.g. dense understorey) is more prone to high-intensity fires. Forest vulnerability may also be extrinsic, linked to forest management, spatial planning, or land use. For example, the presence of roads makes forests more accessible for prevention and firefighting, but also more exposed to fire outbreaks caused by humans. Similarly, the existence of a monitoring system enables earlier detection of pathogen invasions. Climate change increases risk by worsening disturbance regimes (the hazard component), in other words by altering the frequency, intensity and seasonality of disturbance events and the areas they affect. These effects may be direct, for example when water stress due to lack of rainfall and longer, more intense periods of high temperatures weaken trees. They may also be indirect, particularly when new pathogens migrate and become viable (e.g. pine processionary caterpillar) or when endemic species enter epidemic phases (e.g. spruce bark beetle). Between the periods 1950–2000 and 2001–2019, damage caused by natural disturbances increased by 17% in Europe. Storms accounted for 46% of damage across both periods, followed by fires (24%), bark beetles (17%), other biotic agents (8%, e.g. diseases such as ash dieback and chestnut blight), and abiotic agents (8%, e.g. drought, snow). The increase in damage has been particularly marked in recent years for fires and bark beetles (Figure 2). The latter were responsible for 50% of the timber harvest in Germany in 2021. In France, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, 30,000 hectares of coniferous forests containing spruces (18% of the regional total) were destroyed or harvested between 2018 and 2022 due to bark beetle attacks. Since 2023, the crisis has affected all altitudinal levels of the Jura massif, including above 1,000 m4. Droughts, meanwhile, affected 0.5 million hectares of forests between 1987 and 2016 in Europe, and four of the five most severe events occurred after 20005. Figure 2 – Annual damage due to natural forest disturbances in Europe, 1950–2019 Ce graphique représente l’évolution des dommages en forêt causés par plusieurs catégories de perturbations naturelles, de 1950 à 2019. On voit que ceux-ci ont fortement augmenté au cours du temps. This graph shows the evolution of forest damage caused by several categories of natural disturbances, from 1950 to 2019. It illustrates the strong increase in damage over time. Source : Patacca M. et al. 2022, “Significant increase in natural disturbance impacts on European forests since 1950”, Global Change Biology Southern Europe could, during the 21st century, experience a 40 to 100% increase in annual burnt area. The fire season could lengthen by 20 days, and the probability of “megafires” increase tenfold6, 7. Temperate and boreal regions would also be affected, albeit to a lesser extent. In France, fire risk is expected to rise particularly sharply in the West and along the Mediterranean coastline8. For a +4 °C warming by the end of the century, the fire season would last 131 days and fires would affect 67% of the south-eastern quarter of the country, compared with 78 days and 28% at present9. Climate change accelerates the development cycle of pathogens and extends the areas favourable to them. The main epidemic currently underway is that of the spruce bark beetle. In western Europe, the damage it causes could be six times higher in 2021–2030 compared with 1971–201010. Storms are rare and complex events that are difficult to model. Climate change could increase wind speeds and make extreme events more common. In central Europe, a storm that is currently expected once a century could see its return period shortened to around 70 years by 210011. The different hazards interact with one another. For example, a forest damaged by a storm is more vulnerable to pathogens, and a drought increases the likelihood of fires. These interactions are expected to intensify under climate change, particularly with regard to biotic risks, making it necessary to adopt a “multi-hazard” perspective12. The occurrence of a hazard directly alters the structure and composition of the forest, as well as the ecosystem services it provides. In the short term, many trees may be destroyed or damaged, and biogeochemical cycles and habitats disrupted. The reorganisation phase that follows immediately after the hazard is crucial13, as it is when the communities that will make up the future forest establish themselves. Several outcomes are possible, ranging from full resilience (same composition and structure) to transition towards a non-forest state (in the case of major and/or repeated hazards), with intermediate states also possible. Biodiversity is affected through the impacts of disturbances on habitats. An affected area may see its species richness (number of species present) increase, decrease or remain stable14. This ambiguous relationship varies depending on the species and the dynamics of disturbances. Negative impacts often concern species that favour closed canopies (e.g. lichens), while others depend on disturbances to survive and establish themselves in open environments. The highest biodiversity levels, at landscape scale, are observed for disturbances of medium severity and size. Conversely, extreme events are generally harmful due to their tendency to homogenise habitats over large areas. The disappearance of a particular species may also be caused by certain hazards (e.g. pathogen affecting a specific tree species, such as ash dieback). A global meta-analysis has shown a negative impact of disturbances on most ecosystem services, particularly carbon sequestration. Soil quality and organic content, timber production and water quality are also affected15. Fires, for instance, increase soil erosion, reduce the recreational value of forests, and cause carbon emissions and release volatile compounds that can affect human health. According to a recent estimate, the three main disturbance agents in Europe (storms, fires, bark beetles) currently threaten the provision of forest ecosystem services by 10.4 to 12.3%. In total, 20 million hectares of forest (9.7% of the total area) would see their multifunctionality threatened, particularly in central and western Europe (Figure 3). Figure 3 – Areas affected by high risk of loss of forest ecosystem services in Europe Cette figure comporte des cartes qui montrent où sont situées, en Europe, les forêts dont les services écosystémiques sont le plus menacés par les perturbations naturelles. Les cartes concernent la production de bois, le stockage de carbone, la protection contre l’érosion et l’usage récréatif. This figure contains maps showing where, in Europe, forests have ecosystem services most threatened by natural disturbances. The maps relate to timber production, carbon storage, protection against erosion and recreational use. Reading: the coloured areas correspond to those most affected (beyond the 8th decile) by the risk to the ecosystem service considered. Other areas are also affected, but the level of risk is lower. Source : Lecina Diaz, J., et al., 2024, “Ecosystem services at risk from disturbance in Europe’s forests”, Global Change Biology Natural hazards pose risks to timber production and the wood industry. A major crisis, such as a storm, causes in the short term an influx of lower-quality timber on the market, reducing prices and disrupting trade16. Later, the damage causes a reduction in timber supply and pressure on prices (which rise), potentially lasting for several decades. In the Czech Republic, the 2018 bark beetle crisis caused an increase of 5.3 to 18 million m³ (+340%) in salvaged damaged timber compared with 2017, leading to a drop in timber prices from €55/m³ to €15/m³ (–73%)17. Disturbances also affect the value of forest land. For example, it decreased by an average of 10% between 1984–2003 and 2001–2020 in western US states, due to the multiplication of fires and droughts. Even unburnt areas are affected, to a lesser extent, through a change in risk perception by buyers18. Hazards also pose a risk of non-permanence for carbon stocks mobilised to mitigate climate change. In Europe, in the future, carbon losses linked to natural disturbances could be of the same order of magnitude as the gains expected from forest management aimed at mitigating climate change19. Due to the inherent uncertainty of meteorological phenomena, the forest carbon sink may vary greatly from year to year20. For example, Storm Vaia alone reduced Italy’s forest carbon sink by 4% in 201821. Recovering damaged timber for industry nevertheless makes it possible to transfer part of the carbon to downstream sectors, partially mitigating these consequences. The introduction of new pests could cause further degradation of the carbon sink. Seidl et al.22 estimate that 10% of European forest carbon would be exposed to five major new pests in Europe by 2080 under a high-warming scenario (RCP 8.5). An invasion by these pests would increase carbon losses due to natural hazards from +2.3% (for beech canker) to +50% (for the Asian longhorn beetle, which attacks several hardwood species). Beyond the direct mortality due to hazards, the decline of the carbon sink may also be attributed to the loss of photosynthetic activity by dying trees (Figure 4). Figure 4 – Breakdown of the decline of the French forest carbon sink between 2010 and 2020 Ce diagramme montre l’évolution du puits de carbone forestier en France de 2010 à 2020. On y voit que sa forte baisse est principalement due aux impacts du changement climatique, et notamment aux dépérissements dus aux perturbations naturelles. This diagram shows the evolution of the forest carbon sink in France from 2010 to 2020. It illustrates that its sharp decline is mainly due to the impacts of climate change, in particular dieback caused by natural disturbance. Source : Secrétariat général à la planification écologique, 2023 1 Direct action on hazards is often difficult, but risk can be reduced by lowering the vulnerability of exposed forests. Interventions are possible at different levels. Two examples are presented here: fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber. Many other measures, which we do not develop here, can also contribute to reducing vulnerability: diversification of forest composition and structure, enhanced monitoring, raising awareness among local stakeholders, etc. In forests, the presence of fuel in the understorey (e.g. low vegetation, branches) increases the risk of fire. It raises the probability of fire outbreaks and their ability to intensify and spread. When fuel is dry and continuous, the risk is even greater. Removing this vegetation preventively reduces forest vulnerability, particularly by lowering sensitivity, while also affecting the hazard component. This is, for example, the aim of the legal obligations for clearing undergrowth. These apply, in 43 French departments, to land located within 200 m of forest areas, within a radius of 50 m around buildings. These “wildland-urban” interface zones are particularly vulnerable, due to the high potential for fire outbreaks and the presence of buildings, people and economic activities. Similar measures exist elsewhere, for instance in Catalonia, Spain. In some regions, grazing is used to reduce fuel, through payments for environmental services23. A recent study assessed the impact of forest fuel management in California, where fires caused average annual damage estimated at $117 billion between 2017 and 202124. By 2050, the increase in fire intensity could be offset by the annual treatment of 240,000 hectares. The current target is to treat 400,000 hectares, which would avoid losses of $10.9 billion for an estimated annual cost of $3 billion, while each year of delay in achieving this target would lead to $4 billion in losses. However, according to the economists behind the study, the optimal area to treat to maximise benefits would be 1.6 million hectares per year, four times higher than the current target. Fuel can also be deliberately burnt preventively. Prescribed burning is a preventive measure that reduces the fuel load to prevent fire outbreaks. In France, it is planned by the State, local authorities or their representatives, and carried out by professionals. This practice also helps to maintain the good condition of certain ecosystems. Another solution, tactical fires and backfires, are firefighting techniques used during a blaze. They aim to channel the fire and support firefighting personnel. When storms occur, they generate a sudden influx of damaged timber. Recovering it enables owners to generate income, which is then reinvested in forest management. Being able to commercialise this “crisis timber” improves the adaptive capacity of forests. Conversely, leaving such timber on site increases the likelihood of another crisis (e.g. disease, fire outbreak), raising the sensitivity (and therefore vulnerability) of the stand to potential cascading hazards. Following a major crisis, wood recovery may be coordinated and supported by the State. It mainly involves two methods: storing timber for later processing locally; or exporting it to other regions25. These interventions help to ease pressure on local markets and smooth out negative economic impacts (e.g. price falls). First, an assessment of the damage must be carried out to prioritise operations. Rapid intervention is particularly necessary in the case of disease, to avoid its spread and timber degradation. During storage, timber health can be stabilised by treating it once removed from the forest (heat treatment, fumigation) and by ensuring proper storage conditions (ventilation, distance from forest, contact with the ground). A timber mobilisation plan was implemented in France following Storm Klaus (2009), which destroyed 42.5 million m³ of timber, mainly in the Aquitaine region. It included direct support for timber storage (creation and rehabilitation of storage areas) and transport outside the region, for a total of €126 million. Ultimately, 55% of the 29.5 million m³ of timber harvested post-storm benefited from direct aid. An economic model26 showed that this plan encouraged storage (+25%), accelerated and increased timber recovery (+33%), although it did not prevent the fall in prices (–60% for maritime pine). Over ten years, the plan is estimated to have generated an economic gain of €44 million for the forest-wood sector. An even more storage-focused strategy would have been more beneficial but would have slowed the recovery of prices, to the detriment of local producers. In the future, more damaged timber will be available due to the worsening of disturbance regimes. A recent foresight study27 emphasises the importance of anticipating this dynamic, not only for the economic aspects mentioned above, but also for maintaining the forest carbon sink. Upstream, it will be necessary to increase proactive harvesting of declining timber and prioritise it, in crisis years, over standard harvesting. Downstream, processing and storage capacities will need to be increased. Innovation will also be a key factor, in order to make better use of downgraded timber and, where possible, direct it towards long-life uses (e.g. construction), which are more beneficial from a climate perspective. The vulnerability of forests to natural disturbances, exacerbated by climate change, is a crucial issue for the management of forest ecosystems. This note has clarified the components of risk, distinguishing hazard, vulnerability and the assets associated with forests. Concrete examples show that forests are increasingly exposed to multiple hazards, particularly in Europe, with varied effects on ecosystem services, the forest economy and biodiversity. Adaptation strategies, such as fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber, can mitigate these impacts by reducing forest vulnerability. In the future, the development of a multi-hazard approach and proactive management practices will be crucial. To this end, it will be necessary to rely on clear conceptual frameworks in order to target the different components of risk appropriately. However, uncertainties remain about the complex interactions between the different hazards and the scale of future changes. Further research is needed to refine our knowledge, particularly regarding the impacts of extreme events. Other elements beyond forests are exposed, and potentially vulnerable, to the hazards discussed here. These include populations (fires can harm health through air pollution) and infrastructure (transport, housing, etc.).

Title: Robinhood’s Crypto Revenue Miss Tempers Solid Quarter: JPMorgan

Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) called Robinhood’s (HOOD) third-quarter results solid but lower quality, as weaker crypto revenue and tax benefits drove much of the earnings beat. The bank said the roughly 15% earnings per share (EPS) beat was mostly due to a lower tax rate tied to stock-based compensation from the 52% rise in the share price, in a report published Thursday. Analysts led by Kenneth Worthington expect the trading platform's margins to keep improving and raised their price target on the shares to $130 from $122, while reiterating their neutral rating on the stock. The shares slumped 11% yesterday, closing around $127. Crypto was the main drag, with net revenue of $268 million missing both Street and JPMorgan estimates, sending shares lower despite strong volume growth. The bank said Robinhood’s crypto fee rate slipped to 67 basis points from an expected 68, as management continues to adjust pricing. Prediction markets offset some weakness, though the analysts cautioned that the segment depends on a small group of active traders.

Title: Vodafone and AST SpaceMobile Announce New EU Satellite Constellation and Select Germany for European Sovereign Satellite Operations Centre

Time Published: 2025-11-07T07:00:00Z

November 07, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: Vodafone Group PLC Vodafone Group PLC London London LONDON, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vodafone Group and AST SpaceMobile Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) have selected Germany as the location for their main Satellite Operations Centre. The centre will allocate, and map satellite connectivity used by SatCo to serve mobile network operators (MNOs) across Europe to ensure ubiquitous mobile broadband in underserved areas and support emergency services and disaster relief agencies. It will be located near either Munich or Hannover, depending on final negotiations with all relevant parties. AST SpaceMobile is building the first and only space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by everyday smartphones, designed for both commercial and government applications. SatCo aims to provide a scalable European satellite mobile broadband service for use by MNOs to benefit all European citizens, businesses and public sector organisations. MNOs in 21 European Union (EU) member states and other European countries have expressed interest in adopting the service, with commercial launch planned to commence from 2026. The planned EU constellation will include a comprehensive ‘command switch’ feature to support European oversight and security. This capability supports updating all telemetry, tracking, and control (TTC) encryption keys for both S-Band (used to connect smartphones from space) and Q/V-Band (used for links between satellites and earth stations). It also allows for the modification of service encryption keys for communications across the continent, as well as manages the activation, deactivation, and direction of satellite beams in Europe. In addition to commercial mobile broadband, the constellation will support public protection and disaster relief efforts (PPDR). It does this by providing reliable, broadband-speed connectivity from space directly to the everyday smartphones and other cellular devices of emergency responders, even in the most dangerous and challenging environments. Margherita Della Valle, CEO of Vodafone, said: “SatCo delivers a sovereign satellite solution to the whole of Europe. It will give European operators access to secure and resilient satellite communications, complementing existing terrestrial telecommunications networks. By establishing a satellite constellation in the EU and our principal command centre in Germany, we are ensuring the next frontier of communications infrastructure is firmly embedded in Europe.” “Together with Vodafone, we are accelerating the arrival of true mobile broadband from space across Europe,” said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. “Germany’s Operations Centre will be the operations hub for our BlueBird constellation in Europe, enabling us to serve millions of users. Alongside our gateways, we are building a robust, secure infrastructure that ensures Europe stays connected with seamless mobile broadband, always.” The planned satellite constellation can also contribute to the development of a pan-European mobile broadband system, enhancing the communication and coordination of emergency services during crises and disasters, in line with the EU Critical Communication System (EUCCS) vision. In particular, the satellites will support frequency bands that are suitable for PPDR radio communications, subject to national decisions and deployment choices. While many functions are automated, specialist engineers at the Operations Centre will monitor and respond to extraterrestrial events such as solar flares, as well as manage issues that arise on Earth. It will also house one of a network of SatCo ground-based gateway stations across Europe. These gateways provide secure backhaul links between the satellite constellation and terrestrial 4G/5G networks, enabling users to switch automatically between space-based and land-based coverage for uninterrupted, resilient connectivity. AST SpaceMobile has submitted through Germany the appropriate filings with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialised agency of the United Nations. This will help manage and mitigate any signal interference and ensure the smooth integration with existing mobile telecoms networks. Germany’s strategically central location provides SatCo with the ideal foundation to complement terrestrial networks, supporting the need to keep users across Europe remain securely connected anytime, anywhere. In addition to providing service to all EU MNOs using their national spectrum bands, SatCo is a candidate for access to the EU 2GHz Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) spectrum. If secured, this would enable existing MNOs to distribute a fully pan-European, sovereign, space-based broadband service directly to their customers. The aforementioned PPDR frequency bands (698–703/753–758 MHz and 733–736/788–791 MHz) would be used to support this capability.
