We have now updated our massive collection of Black Friday deals, the Google sale is already live, and Samsung is in full swing, but there’s even more we want to bring to your attention. Firstly, Backbone One USB-C – one of the best Android mobile game controllers – is now seeing solid price drops, but we also have Samsung’s originally $600 34-inch Odyssey G5 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor at just $265 as well. A fresh collection of Google Nest deals are also live – Nest Doorbell and cameras are now now up to $100 off – and we have some seriously notable deals on ultra-affordable A9+ and S6 Samsung Galaxy tabs from $149. Everything else awaits below. If you’re looking for a super affordable 2024 tablet for casual browsing, video chatting, or even something for the whole fam, the Amazon Black Friday sale is now offering Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Android tablet down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $330, this is $130 off, $30 below the early Black Friday sale price, and within $0.50 of the lowest we have ever tracked. This is easily one of the most notable deals we have tracked since its release back in April and among the most affordable Samsung tablets we have seen to date that actually ships with the S Pen in the box. It is worth noting that the Galaxy Tab S6 comes in at roughly $50 more than the Black Friday deal we are tracking on the brand’s other ultra-affordable tab, the Galaxy Tab A9+ at $149 shipped. However, as alluded to above, the S6 is a more complete experience with slightly better specs and includes the Samsung S Pen so you can sketch and doodle away without spending any more money. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: The Google Black Friday sale is now live, we are tracking the very first price drop on the all-new Google Nest Learning Thermostat 4th Gen, and now it’s time to take a look at the rest of this year’s Google Nest Black Friday offers. Alongside the new smart thermostat deal, we are also tracking price drops on the latest Nest Cam Outdoor or Indoor Battery model as well as the wired indoor variants and the Google Nest Doorbell down at $99.98 shipped in all colorways. This includes both the wireless and the wired options for folks looking to integrate the smart video doorbell into an existing chime and power system. Everything you need to know about the all-time low now live on the brand new Google Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) is waiting right here. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. As part of its Black Friday deals, Amazon is offering one of the best gaming monitor deals by dropping Samsung’s 34-inch Odyssey G55T 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor to $265.04 shipped. This originally $600 gaming display has fetched as much as $500 in recent months, but it has mostly been sitting at the $380 mark. We saw it drop to $300 over a month ago in September, but today’s Black Friday deal at Amazon lands it $35 below that price to mark a new all-time low. This is easily one of the best gaming monitor deals we’ve tracked over the last few weeks for Black Friday, and you can learn more about this model below. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

The cryptocurrency market in November 2024 showcased significant milestones, regulatory shifts, and industry trends. Here are the key takeaways: November 2024 marked a historic moment in the cryptocurrency market, driven by the increasing influence of U.S.-approved spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). With inflows reaching $6.2 billion this month alone, these ETFs have significantly transformed Bitcoin’s adoption trajectory. The shift from futures-based ETFs to spot ETFs signals greater confidence among institutional investors and provides a regulated, accessible pathway for traditional finance to engage with Bitcoin. Unlike futures ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs track the cryptocurrency’s market price directly, eliminating inefficiencies caused by contango or backwardation in futures markets. The inflow of institutional funds has reshaped Bitcoin’s market dynamics: Source: Santiment Source: Farside Investors Source: Glassnode Bitcoin’s performance in November 2024 reflects the combined impact of macroeconomic forces and on-chain dynamics. With institutional confidence growing and on-chain activity reaching new heights, Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency landscape. However, cautious optimism is advised as the market approaches the critical $100,000 milestone. November 2024 has been a month of technical milestones for Bitcoin, with bullish patterns forming on the charts. A key highlight is Bitcoin’s breakout from a multi-month ascending triangle, signaling strong upward momentum. This section analyzes the technical indicators that defined Bitcoin’s trajectory this month and explores potential scenarios for December. Whale accumulation: Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s technical performance in November underscores its bullish trajectory, with strong patterns and indicators supporting further upward movement. While challenges remain at critical resistance levels, the outlook for December remains optimistic, driven by both technical and on-chain factors. Ethereum has maintained its position as a leading blockchain network in November 2024, driven by record-high staking participation, significant contributions to the DeFi sector, and anticipation for its next major upgrade. These developments underscore Ethereum’s resilience and adaptability in a competitive crypto landscape. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) continues to strengthen, with staking metrics reaching new milestones: Source: Dune Analytics Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance ecosystem, contributing to its robust performance: Source: DefiLlama Ethereum’s development roadmap remains a critical driver of its market sentiment: Ethereum’s price movements mirrored its strong fundamentals: Ethereum’s achievements in November 2024 highlight its leadership in staking, DeFi, and network development. With record-high staking participation, growing Layer 2 adoption, and a major upgrade on the horizon, Ethereum is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in the blockchain ecosystem. November 2024 marked a defining moment for Solana (SOL), as it solidified its position as a leading altcoin through groundbreaking performance and ecosystem growth. With its price reaching an all-time high of $264, significant institutional interest, and surging decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, Solana has emerged as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency landscape. Source: DefiLlama Solana’s breakout performance in November 2024 underscores its potential as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. With record highs in price, trading volume, and ecosystem adoption, Solana is poised to redefine its role in the blockchain space. For market participants, aligning with its growth trajectory could yield substantial rewards in the months to come. Donald Trump’s re-election in 2024 has ushered in a pro-crypto agenda aimed at fostering innovation and regulatory clarity. This shift has bolstered the cryptocurrency market, driving institutional participation and expanding the scope of digital asset investment vehicles. A key development has been the wave of spot Bitcoin and Solana ETF filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reflecting the growing interest in regulated crypto products. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto governance is shaping the U.S. cryptocurrency market by fostering innovation, attracting institutional capital, and expanding investment opportunities. The influx of ETF filings, including those for Solana and Bitcoin, highlights the evolving landscape. With regulatory clarity on the horizon, the U.S. is poised to solidify its position as a global leader in digital assets. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of innovation within the blockchain ecosystem. In November 2024, AI-focused tokens surged in popularity, driven by partnerships, real-world applications, and increasing institutional interest. These tokens are bridging the gap between blockchain technology and AI, positioning themselves as key players in the Web3 landscape. Risk management: AI tokens are reshaping the Web3 narrative by bringing real-world utility to blockchain technology. As adoption grows across industries, these tokens have the potential to redefine how decentralized ecosystems interact with AI. For traders and investors, the focus should remain on projects with strong partnerships, innovative applications, and a clear regulatory roadmap. Blockchain gaming continues to solidify its role in the Web3 ecosystem, addressing criticisms of prioritizing profits over playability. November 2024 witnessed notable advancements as projects focused on enhancing gameplay experiences, while adoption metrics highlighted the sector’s resilience. This section explores key trends, case studies, and market performance within the blockchain gaming landscape. Blockchain gaming is undergoing a transformative phase, balancing profitability with meaningful player experiences. As projects innovate to address accessibility and retention, the sector’s potential to drive Web3 adoption becomes increasingly apparent. For market participants, staying aligned with evolving player preferences and technological advancements will be crucial. Blockchain is pushing the boundaries of what Play-to-Earn (P2E) models can achieve. In November 2024, AMBCrypto conducted an exclusive survey involving over 5,000 participants, shedding light on key challenges and opportunities in this growing sector. The findings reveal a shift in player priorities, with an increasing emphasis on playability and sustainable ecosystems. The NFT market in November 2024 continued its transformation from a speculation-driven space to one emphasizing real-world utility and innovation. While trading volumes declined by 15% MoM, projects focusing on functional NFTs gained traction, highlighting a shift in market priorities. Source: NFTGo The NFT market in November 2024 reflects a critical pivot toward sustainability and utility. As speculative interest wanes, projects delivering real-world benefits are poised to lead the next phase of growth. For investors and participants, focusing on functional NFTs and cross-chain innovations will be key to staying ahead in this evolving landscape.

Title: What's Happening With Super Micro Stock?

Time Published: 2024-11-29T16:30:05Z

POLAND - 2024/11/15: In this photo illustration, a Super Micro logo is displayed on a smartphone ... [+] with stock market percentages in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Server maker Super Micro Computer stock (NASDAQ: SMCI) extended its recent rally, gaining close to 30% over the last five trading days. The stock now trades at $35 per share, up about 2x from recent lows seen around mid-November, when investors were concerned about the company’s potential delisting from the Nasdaq exchange. Last week, the company said that it had hired BDO as its public auditor, replacing Ernst & Young, who resigned in October after it raised concerns regarding the accuracy of the company’s financial statements. With the new public auditor on board, Super Micro is expected to gain additional time to avoid delisting from Nasdaq as it works to file its overdue 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 2024 and its September quarter report. Separately, see how Disney may be undervalued in Disney Stock To 2x? Looking over a longer period, SMCI stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 39% in 2021, 87% in 2022, and 246% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Now even considering the strong historical performance and the recent rally, SMCI stock is still down by a massive 70% from its all-time highs earlier this year. The stock also trades at just about 9x projected 2025 earnings. However, jumping into SMCI stock might not be a wise move just yet, in our view. Here’s why. Significant risks remain for Super Micro. The company’s new auditor will have to rework its financial statements and this process will likely take time. Super Micro has only indicated in filings that it plans to submit its overdue financial reports, but has not provided a specific timeline. Separately, earlier this week, the company announced it had prepaid borrowings from Bank of America and Cathay Bank. Some of the debt had covenants that required the company to file its FY 2024 and most recent quarterly financial statements by December 31. On the upside, by fully prepaying these loans, SMCI has eliminated the need to meet this reporting deadline. On the downside, this could also signal that there could be further delays in filing its audited accounts. Now, Super Micro Computer has been a big winner in the generative AI space, as demand for its server systems surged as companies looked to deploy the latest GPUs using the company’s server solutions. Revenues more than doubled in FY’24, with consensus estimates pointing to an additional 80% increase for the current fiscal year. However, the AI growth story doesn’t compensate for the company’s corporate governance concerns and questions about its financial reporting. Want to profit from shifts in the AI market? Consider this trade Sell Nvidia, Buy AMD Stock The company’s recent troubles began in August after short-seller Hindenburg Research pointed to multiple red flags in the company’s accounting practices. Further, The Wall Street Journal reported in late September that the U.S. Justice Department may be probing the company, although the investigation was reportedly in its early stages at the time. The company’s history of delayed reports and concerns raised by various parties doesn’t exactly inspire trust. Even if the company’s valuation looks reasonable today, issues with internal controls and accounting practices may impact its long-term viability and ability to deliver shareholder value. It also remains to be seen if the new auditor will indeed sign off on the company’s accounts. Given these risks, it’s probably best to exercise caution with SMCI stock until there are signs that the company’s core accounting issues have been be resolved.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Rocket Lab USA (RKLB, Financial) reached its highest level at $27.5 per share on November 29, 2024 after recorded a single-day gain of 8.3%. This reflects an impressive 398% year to date return, fueled by increased investor risk appetite and a vibrant market environment. Currently, the company has a market capitalization of $13.5 billion, with expected annual revenue growth of 77%. Some financial highlights include the third quarter of 2024 revenues of $105 million, 55% more than a year earlier. So, in Q4, Rocket Lab's projected revenues are $125-$135 million and gross margins of 26-28%. Further, expanding the company's growth narrative, the company has been awarded a $23.9 million grant following the recent signing of the CHIPS Act to advance to increase semiconductor production in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The aerospace businesses also started their growth with this company. Its Neutron rocket went through the qualification process and secured the first commercial order. This is well aligned with Rocket Lab's current Electron rocket, which will be instrumental in this firm. Wall Street has paid attention, adjusting price targets for the Company BofA Securities, Cantor Fitzgerald, and TD Cowen to show a hopeful forward for Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab's progress includes building and launching the Neutron rocket while achieving notable milestones. The company has accomplished two launches in under 24 hours and secured a multi-launch deal for its Neutron lander. It has achieved these milestones by demonstrating its position as a responsive space solutions provider and a comprehensive aerospace solutions and services company.?

The company announced its 12th stock issuance in a Nov. 28 notice . Metaplanet will issue the 29,000 stock acquisition rights for 100 shares each to Cayman Islands investment management firm EVO Fund. *Metaplanet Announces Issuance of Moving Strike Stock Acquisition Rights to Raise Up to ¥9.5 billion ($62 million) for Accelerated Bitcoin Accumulation* pic.twitter.com/bL7rs6Qkk4 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) November 28, 2024 “The majority of the funds raised this time will be strategically allocated for the purchase of additional Bitcoin,” the notice reads. “We have made it clear that we intend to utilize debt and periodic stock issuance to systematically increase our Bitcoin holdings while reducing exposure to a depreciating yen.” Metaplanet further highlighted that Bitcoin’s “prominence continues to grow” after it nearly hit $100,000 earlier this month. On the other hand, “the Japanese yen continues to depreciate, with the USD/JPY exchange rate returning to the 154 level on the same day, presenting ongoing concerns.” “Given these circumstances, we recognize the urgent importance of increasing our Bitcoin holdings and have therefore decided to proceed with this fundraising initiative,” the company concluded. The stock acquisition still needs approval by local regulators under Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. If approved, the operation will take place from Dec. 16, 2024 until June 16, 2025. At the current price of about $98,000 per Bitcoin, the company would acquire over 638 BTC with the proceedings of the deal. Metaplanet also said that it had decided to put aside its “metaverse related businesses plans” since “there is still no prospect of profitability, and has decided to incorporate the purchase and holding of Bitcoin as part of our stated corporate treasury strategy.” The comments follow public disappointment with the results of the metaverse under development by Meta (formally Facebook) following a $177 billion investment by the company by the summer of 2022. As Decrypt reported at the time, the platforms' graphics being heralded as at the forefront of the metaverse look about the same—if not worse—than the 20-year-old virtual world Second Life. In its acquisition of Bitcoin for its corporate treasury, Metaplanet is following in the footsteps of U.S. business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which under the direction of its chairman Michael Saylor has pursued an aggressive strategy of Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy now holds well over 1% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply, while Saylor has touted his “Bitcoin playbook” to a number of firms, including Tesla and more recently Microsoft. Still, after seeing renewed interest at the start of the current crypto bull run, MicroStrategy’s stock took a 16% dive just as Bitcoin was approaching $100,000. At the time, one analyst explained why their firm took a short position on MicroStrategy while being long on Bitcoin.

UPDATED 10:16 EST / NOVEMBER 29 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof It’s time to get ready for Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference, starting Monday in Las Vegas — the biggest cloud computing conference of the year. To prepare, check out our new Special Report: AI and the Cloud, with exclusive features, interviews and analysis, and all the important news starting next week. We take a deep dive into AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation, and also analyze the prospects for AI’s hottest new thing: agents, as well as the considerable challenges to their roll-out. In addition, theCUBE Research analyst John Furrier interviewed top AWS executives ahead of re:Invent, including AI and data chief Swami Sivasubramanian, enterprise solutions head Colleen Aubrey, developer experience VP Deepak Singh, and Dilip Kumar, head of Q for Business. We’ll have all the news next week from re:Invent keynotes and interviews, along with analysis from theCUBE Research and interviews on theCUBE. In other news this past week, big money continued to roll into cybersecurity as Halcyon raised $100 million and N-able acquired Adlumin for $266 million. TheCUBE Research Chief Analyst Dave Vellante assessed his 2024 predictions. ChatGPT gave him an A-, but he gave himself a B. This week saw a mixed bag of earnings reports ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but some significant guidance disappointments from Dell, HP, CrowdStrike and Workday weighed on stocks. Meantime, Pony AI’s IPO disappointed as well. Lots of earnings reports are coming next week too, among them Hewlett Packard Enterprise, UiPath, Salesforce and Zscaler. Here’s the news and analysis this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Check out our newest special report on the intersection of cloud and AI, ahead of AWS’ annual re:Invent conference Dec. 2-6 in Las Vegas. As at just about every tech conference these days, AI will be the star. We’ll have all the news from re:Invent, plus exclusive interviews from theCUBE and analysis from theCUBE Research. First up is our deep dive into Annapurna Labs, Amazon’s accelerator chip operation in Austin, Texas: Amazon’s secretive AI weapon: An exclusive look inside AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation We took a deep dive into the promises and perils of agentic AI, which will be a prime topic at re:Invent — and just about every tech conference after that: Safety and reliability concerns temper agentic AI mania And a closer look at the challenges underneath the hype: AI agents are practical.

Title: Conor McGregor Inc: the fighter’s potential losses in the fallout from civil rape case are enormous

When a High Court jury found against Conor McGregor in his civil rape case last week, the Hollywood Reporter jumped on the story of his legal woes. The coverage in the US film industry’s go-to news publication was as big a sign as any of McGregor’s seemingly unstoppable journey into the ritzy world of entertainment from the bloodied mixed martial arts octagon. Now he is counting the cost of what he did on that December 2018 day in the penthouse suite of the Beacon Hotel in Sandyford, south Dublin. His potential losses in the fallout from the case are enormous. This was shaping up to a big year for McGregor. But that was before Nikita Hand told a believing jury of a terrifying sexual assault by a professional fighter who “would not take no for an answer”. The Dublin woman was awarded nearly €250,000 in damages after the jury found that she was raped by McGregor in the Dublin hotel in December 2018. McGregor (36) owns three Dublin pubs: the Black Forge Inn and the Marble Arch in Drimnagh, and the Waterside in Howth, where plans for a boutique hotel were rejected by Fingal County Council. But he always wanted to stride on a bigger stage – and did so with alacrity. [ Conor McGregor was facilitated by a culture of entitlement and cheered on by adoring fansOpens in new window ] He made his Hollywood debut in March, starring in the move Road House with A-list actor Jake Gyllenhaal. In June he struck a new deal to use his image in the Hitman video game, a global franchise. He continued to promote Proper No. Twelve, the whiskey brand he sold three years ago for $130 million (€123 million) and was on a drive to create international markets for his Forged Stout brand. The sales slogan said much about his ambition for the new brew: “Better watch out, because we’re not here to take part, we’re here to take over.” It echoes McGregor’s famous line from his post-fight octagon interview at UFC Fight Night Dublin in 2014, when he was at the vanguard of a number of Irish fighters appearing on the promotion. Now it is events that have taken over, threatening an empire that traded on McGregor’s ability to connect directly with a certain cohort of young men with an almost cult-like appeal. Ms Hand’s account of how McGregor “brutally raped and battered her” has dealt a crippling blow to his earning power. Retailers are taking McGregor drink from their shelves – and his image has been pulled from whiskey marketing and video games. His childhood soccer team in Crumlin, Lourdes Celtic, is said locally to be removing his name from players’ kit but the club itself did not reply to questions. Even the National Wax Museum has removed his sculpture. Forged Stout was sold in off-licences and supermarkets and a relatively small number of pubs so the delisting inflicts financial pain. However, for the McGregor brand the real money was in the US. There could be serious implications there too. “Financially, and then [in terms of] future revenue generating, it’s very damaging for him,” said Prof Norm O’Reilly, author of 20 books on sports sponsorship and dean of the University of New England business school. “I would say for most brands this is now like a hands-off, certainly in the very short term. It doesn’t look good. It’s about images. Image transfer is the core of why sponsorship works. He added: “If you and I own a company and we’re trying to be a little edgy, he’s no longer our choice, right?” There are “many other athletes out there who have a bit of edge” but who haven’t “done something like this to women”, said Prof O’Reilly. McGregor was in full plumage when he claimed to be “the highest-paid first-time actor of all time” for his villain role in Road House, an action thriller remake of a 1980s blockbuster that starred the late Patrick Swayze. He is said to have received $5 million for the role, prompting his claim to have been paid more than wrestler-turned Hollywood star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson when he burst on to the screen decades ago. Nikita Hand has won her civil case against MMA fighter Conor McGregor. The 35 year-old Dublin woman alleged he raped her in the penthouse suite of The Beacon Hotel in December 2018. The jury, believing her account of assault, found in her favour; returning a verdict yesterday evening after six hours of deliberations. McGregor has been ordered to pay Ms. Hand almost €250,000 in damages. But why has the UFC fighter not been found guilty of rape? How has Ms. Hand successfully sued him in the High Court? And what did the jury hear to persuade them she was the one telling the truth. Frank Greaney is courts correspondent for the Bauer Media group, which owns radio stations including Newstalk and TodayFM. He explains how Nikita Hand faced down McGregor at great personal cost. Please be advised this episode contains details of sexual assault, which some listeners may find distressing.Produced and presented by Aideen Finnegan. Johnson is now a superstar. Any hopes of McGregor to follow him or Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder-turned movie star-turned politician, must be measured against the jury’s verdict. Despite the boycott, Road House remains on Amazon Prime’s streaming service. The company had nothing to say about McGregor. “We’re not offering any comment,” Amazon Prime said. McGregor’s Hollywood agent, Audie Attar, did not reply to questions. Similarly, his London-based spokeswoman did not respond to queries. These included the question of whether McGregor was contractually bound to repay fees in the event of adverse court findings. “Those are pretty common in contracts now if this [behaviour] is over a line that the brands wanted,” Prof O’Reilly said. The business meltdown started on Monday when IO Interactive, Danish owner of the Hitman gaming franchise, cut ties with the fighter. “In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately,” the company said. “We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr McGregor from our storefronts starting today.” IO Interactive did not respond to further questions. Yet it is clear the company had high hopes for a Hitman game with a “mysterious Disruptor featuring global superstar Conor McGregor”. At the time IO Interactive said it was “beyond thrilled” to work with the fighter, citing his “raw charisma and energy”. McGregor said he had “a lot of fun creating the character and bringing him to life”. All of that has now ended. The Irish response was less immediate, coming two days after Rape Crisis Network Ireland urged retailers to stop selling McGregor stout and the whiskey brand he sold to Mexican group Proximo Spirits in 2021. But the dam broke just before lunchtime on Tuesday when Barry Group, owner of Costcutter stores and Carry Out off-licences, became the first to drop Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve Whiskey, saying: “This action reflects our commitment to maintaining a retail environment that resonates with the values of our customers and partners.” [ More than 1,000 shops including Tesco, SuperValu and Centra stores remove brands linked to Conor McGregorOpens in new window ] Musgrave, owner of the Supervalu and Centra chains, quickly followed. So too did wholesaler BWG, saying it will no longer distribute McGregor-linked brands to Spar, Eurospar, Mace, Londis and XL stores. BWG’s decision removed product from 1,000 outlets. Bigger still was Tesco’s move to delist McGregor brands from more than 4,200 Irish and UK stores and its online shop. Then came the response of Proximo, the Mexican owner of Bushmills Irish whiskey and Tequila which made a big bet on Proper No. Twelve in 2021: “Going forward, we do not plan to use Mr McGregor’s name and likeness in the marketing of the brand.” The properwhiskey.com website was soon offline. The bad news kept coming. Retailer Asda dropped Forged Stout from 500 UK stores on Thursday. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon cut the product from seven Irish pubs. Off-licence chain O’Brien’s cut both stout and whiskey, as did State airport group DAA. Manchester-based LWC, the UK’s largest independent drinks wholesaler, also cut ties with McGregor, saying it had taken the “necessary legal steps” to end distribution of his stout. [ From the very start Conor McGregor was telling us and showing us who he wasOpens in new window ] “We are consulting with our customers to support them in the replacement of Forged draught taps. LWC does not want to be associated with Conor McGregor or Forged Irish Stout.” The irony is that McGregor’s “notorious” image once gave business something akin to a golden ticket into the world of young men. Research in 2016 by a sports consultancy then known PSG Sponsorship showed he was the athlete most admired by almost one-in-three Irish people aged 18-34. He was less popular with older people. But the nationwide poll of 1,000 people reflected McGregor’s meteoric rise, placing him ahead of boxer Katie Taylor, rowers Gary and Paul O’Donovan, jockey Ruby Walsh, rugby star Johnny Sexton and soccer player Robbie Keane. He was sixth most popular only two years earlier. Although this carried immense business appeal, the accounts of McGregor’s main Dublin company give little insight into his overall fortune. Abridged financial statements filed on Monday for McGregor Sports and Entertainment Ltd show profits fell in 2023 to €194,297 from €528,263 the previous year, with accumulated profits at €506,475. No longer is the image positive, it’s negative ... now the brand senses a problem McGregor’s returns from the $130 million Proximo deal and the $100 million he reportedly received for a Las Vegas boxing defeat in 2017 to Floyd Mayweather seem to be elsewhere. The money came on top of the tens of millions of dollars he earned from his UFC fight career. Business magazine Forbes listed him as the world’s highest-paid athlete in 2021, behind football stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with salary/winnings of $22 million and endorsements of $158 million. For as long as it lasted, business was fully behind McGregor’s macho personality. “Only a very, very few athletes have properties that reach the kind of markets he does,” said Prof O’Reilly. “He’s kind of on the edge but he’s never really gone over the edge.” That changed with the High Court verdict, no matter that these were civil and not criminal proceedings. “So, no longer is the image positive, it’s negative. So now the brand senses a problem,” said Prof O’Reilly. Right now, McGregor is short on supporters. But one man who has leapt to his defence is Roger Stone, acolyte of incoming US president Donald Trump and a Republican Party activist going back to the time of Richard Nixon. In a bizarre claim, Stone contended in a message to McGregor on X that the allegations against him stemmed from the fighter “telling the truth about how they are trying to destroy free speech in your country”. “Don’t give up. Keep fighting for the Ireland you love. God bless you,” Stone told him in the social media post. Stone’s intervention was in line with dismissive response of the Make America Great Again movement to court findings against Trump. Still, this was a world away from the mass-market allure that McGregor cultivated. Only weeks have passed since a Netflix boxing match yielded a $20 million pay-day for Mike Tyson, who served a prison term for rape in 1990s. Asked whether this showed McGregor could find a way back, Prof O’Reilly said Tyson’s appeal was at the box office, not in sponsorship. Mixed martial arts sponsors may stay with McGregor but “they’re very small”, he said. The bigger potential loss was from sponsors not directly linked to fighting. Citing Tiger Woods’ loss of non-golf sponsors after the exposure of his marital infidelity, Prof O’Reilly said: “It’s literally cost him hundreds of millions of dollars.” McGregor will appeal the court findings but the strain on his business interests could hardly be greater. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit.

READ NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings The Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years. “The use of AI presents the rare — possibly unique — opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system”. While adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists’ outlook on AI and healthcare is “a mix of enthusiasm and despair”. “Enthusiasm because there’s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. … But there’s friction due to regulation, due to incentives — because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things — and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities”. In other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup.

Title: Exclusive | Jamie Dimon has been secretly communicating with Donald Trump on White House agenda for months: sources

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been communicating with Donald Trump in recent months through secret back channels, helping the president-elect hammer out a policy agenda before and since his decisive White House victory, The Post has learned. The 68-year-old Wall Street titan — who, like 78-year-old Trump, grew up in Queens in New York City — has acted as “a sounding board” for the incoming commander-in-chief’s economic manifesto, four sources close to Trump’s transition team said. One GOP insider said the president-elect’s inner circle held a series of “no-holds-barred conversations” with Dimon — who at the time was rumored to be eyeing a government job himself. “They have been speaking regularly for months,” said another GOP source briefed on the situation. Three of the sources close to Trump said the secret back channel focused on plans for cutting government spending, banking regulation, taxes and trade. A company insider added that Trump’s top aides set up the calls, which continued after the election, to “create a bit of daylight” between the two men and stop details of the exchanges leaking. A spokesperson for the Trump transition team declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokesman also declined to comment. The quietly cozy relationship between Trump and Dimon has flourished despite the banker’s cryptic and tight-lipped tendencies when it comes to politics. Trump had floated Dimon’s name as a possible Treasury secretary pick in June and later claimed he had won his White House endorsement — despite a lack of any public statement from Dimon to that effect. Trump and Dimon also have continued to talk despite bouts of tension, including on Nov. 14 when the president-elect declared on Truth Social that Dimon ”will not be invited” to join his Cabinet. The banker promptly shot back: “I haven’t had a boss in 25 years and I’m not about ready to start.” The JPMorgan CEO, a registered Democrat who declined to back either candidate in the White House race, had even reportedly toyed with the idea of joining a Kamala Harris administration but then ruled himself out of leaving the Wall Street giant when her poll numbers tanked, The Post previously reported. On Nov. 22, The Post broke the news that Trump was also consulting with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, a major Dem donor, on policy issues. Nevertheless, the former” Apprentice” star’s admiration of Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase for nearly two decades and has a net worth estimated by Forbes at $2.6 billion, was described by one source as “a man crush.” Another individual close to the president-elect said Trump “greatly appreciated” it when Dimon, an avid reader of the New York Post, told CNBC in January the eventual election winner was “kind of right” to criticize illegal immigration and weak defense spending by America’s NATO allies. Dimon’s comments angered left-wingers within the Biden administration who then blacklisted Dimon from the White House in a fit of pique, as The Post exclusively reported. Two weeks ago, the JPMorgan boss said Trump’s threat of slapping tariffs on Uncle Sam’s major trading partners “will bring people to the table” if “done wisely.” Dimon, a vocal critic of current US banking rules, recently slammed the ‘onslaught’ of red tape drafted by Dem-backed regulators, launching a foul-mouthed tirade over a list of his most-hated pieces of legislation at a recent conference in New York, “It’s time to fight back…I’ve had it with this s–t,” Dimon told the stunned audience. The JPMorgan boss singled out regulations aimed at keeping banks resistant to financial storms by forcing them to hold more capital on their balance sheets. The proposal, known as Basel III, would see major lenders raise that emergency buffer by 9%. “Things are becoming unfair and unjust, and they are hurting companies, a lot of these rules are hurting lower-paid individuals,” Dimon said on Oct. 28. Dimon, who pulled down a salary of $34.5 million last year, urged the US government in his annual letter to shareholders last May to deliver “effective policy-making” issuing a warning that “a politician’s dream is a businessman’s nightmare.” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said Trump’s second term as president will present “the biggest inflection point for banking regulation in three decades.” “This is Jamie’s vindication,” Mayo told The Post. “He is looking at all the bureaucracy and red tape and saying enough of the regulatory theater. It’s like banking with one hand tied behind your back” Mayo added that Trump potentially taking an ax to stringent banking rules “should mean borrowers get better rates for their loans and better services for customers.” The top analyst said: “It would be foolhardy for any administration not to hear Jamie Dimon out. Everyone should at least be consulting him for ideas.” The revelations that Trump has sought advice from a “kitchen cabinet” of Wall Street bigwigs comes after his appointment of staunch loyalist and hedge fund mogul Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. He has been hunkered down at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach building his team for his new administration. Trump’s move to seek informal counsel from titans of American finance, who are outside his MAGA inner circle, could provide further reassurance to investors ahead of his second term in the White House that kicks off on Jan. 20.

Two weeks ago, the JPMorgan boss said Trump’s threat of slapping tariffs on Uncle Sam’s major trading partners “will bring people to the table” if “done wisely.” Dimon, a vocal critic of current US banking rules, recently slammed the ‘onslaught’ of red tape drafted by Dem-backed regulators, launching a foul-mouthed tirade over a list of his most-hated pieces of legislation at a recent conference in New York, “It’s time to fight back…I’ve had it with this s–t,” Dimon told the stunned audience. The JPMorgan boss singled out regulations aimed at keeping banks resistant to financial storms by forcing them to hold more capital on their balance sheets. The proposal, known as Basel III, would see major lenders raise that emergency buffer by 9%. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER “Things are becoming unfair and unjust, and they are hurting companies, a lot of these rules are hurting lower-paid individuals,” Dimon said on Oct. 28. Dimon, who pulled down a salary of $34.5 million last year, urged the US government in his annual letter to shareholders last May to deliver “effective policy-making” issuing a warning that “a politician’s dream is a businessman’s nightmare.” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said Trump’s second term as president will present “the biggest inflection point for banking regulation in three decades.” “This is Jamie’s vindication,” Mayo told The Post. “He is looking at all the bureaucracy and red tape and saying enough of the regulatory theater. It’s like banking with one hand tied behind your back” Mayo added that Trump potentially taking an ax to stringent banking rules “should mean borrowers get better rates for their loans and better services for customers.” The top analyst said: “It would be foolhardy for any administration not to hear Jamie Dimon out. Everyone should at least be consulting him for ideas.” The revelations that Trump has sought advice from a “kitchen cabinet” of Wall Street bigwigs comes after his appointment of staunch loyalist and hedge fund mogul Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. He has been hunkered down at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach building his team for his new administration. Trump’s move to seek informal counsel from titans of American finance, who are outside his MAGA inner circle, could provide further reassurance to investors ahead of his second term in the White House that kicks off on Jan. 20.

For Black Friday, Nintendo is offering a great bundle that includes a Switch console, a free copy of Mario Kart 8, and a one-year Nintendo Switch online membership. The bundle is available with the Switch or Switch OLED. Each bundle offers a savings of $80 to begin with and Walmart has them both on sale for $50 off, so you get a total savings of $130.

The Spectra model also has color-changing LED lights. The Tomtoc Carrying Case comes with an integrated stand that lets you play your Switch while charging it. This Ivoler case can be carried with a handle or shoulder strap. It's big enough to fit a Switch, dock, controller, and 18 game cards. Microsoft is offering an excellent selection of Black Friday gaming deals, including discounts on various Xbox consoles and accessories. The Xbox Series X Digital Edition is down to an all-time low of $398 while the 512GB Xbox Series S is $50 off at Best Buy. This Series X model offers the same graphical performance as the standard edition but it does not include a disc drive. It typically costs $50 less than the disc-drive model. The Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as the Series X, but it still benefits from Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft's robust online services, offering great value for less money. The iconic Xbox Core controller works with various Xbox systems, but it can also connect to your PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android. Microsoft’s official battery pack for the Xbox wireless controller replaces the standard AA batteries and can be charged with the controller’s usual USB cable. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers a Netflix-style subscription with hundreds of games for Xbox and PC, along with online multiplayer support. Members can also stream games on mobile devices, Samsung TVs, and select Fire TV sticks. An Ultimate membership typically costs $20, but most retailers sell one month for $17. PlayStation 5 systems and accessories are seeing great discounts for Black Friday. The Digital Edition console is down to a new low. Meanwhile, the PS5 with disc drive is available for $75 off, and this PS VR2 bundle is a whopping $250 off. And though not discounted, the brand-new PS5 Pro is in stock for its regular price of $699. The PS5 is one of the best consoles thanks to its powerful hardware, exclusives, and 4K Blu-ray drive. Though it typically costs $50 more than the digital-edition PS5, this model lets you play game discs. This slim version of the console is also slightly smaller than the original and has 1TB of storage. The PS5 Slim Digital Edition is for downloadable games only and costs $50 less than the standard PS5 with a disc drive. A disc drive add-on can be bought separately should you wish to use physical discs at a later date for an extra $80. This bundle includes a slim disc-drive edition PlayStation 5 console with a copy of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latest entry in the popular action RPG franchise. With this bundle, buyers get a slim PlayStation 5 console with disc drive and a copy of Madden NFL 25, the latest game in the long-running football series. The PS VR2 is a virtual reality headset built for the PS5. It also supports a PC adapter (sold separately for $60) that can pair with computers to play SteamVR games. This bundle includes a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. These wireless earbuds are designed for gaming with a PS5 or PC. They support active noise cancellation and a 2.4GHz wireless connection for lag-free playback. This wired gaming headset has a white color scheme that's designed to match the PS5 console. It has a boom microphone for voice chat that can be flipped up to mute. For Black Friday, you can now snag a Quest 3S bundle that includes the 128GB headset, the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, a three-month Meta Quest+ subscription, and a $75 Amazon credit for a total of $299. To get the deal, just use the coupon code QUEST75 at checkout. You can learn more about the 3S VR headset in our Meta Quest 3S review. The 256GB Quest 3S and the step-up Quest 3 model aren't available with the Amazon credit but they both still include the free game and subscription. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). As an added bonus when buying from Amazon, enter code: QUEST75 at checkout to get a free $75 credit. The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. PC and laptop gamers can save tons on new systems during Black Friday. Right now, the Asus TUG A15 gaming laptop is down to $999 which is just $20 more than the lowest price it's ever dipped to. We're also seeing great deals on monitors, like this 50% discount on Samsung's 43-inch Odyssey Neo G7. The Asus TUF is built with military-grade shock resistance, and its incredibly powerful battery can last for around nine hours on a single charge. This Katana model sports a 15.6-inch QHD display capable of up to 165Hz. It has a supremely powerful processor, and and upper midrange GPU for games that can handle any game at high settings, depending on the game and the frame rate you're looking for. Acer's Nitro V Series is known for offering solid performance at budget-friendly prices. This entry-level gaming laptop features an Intel Core i7 CPU and a GeForce RTX 4050 GPU. It also has a Full HD 15.6-inch screen with a 144Hz refresh rate. HP's Omen PCs are built for gamers, and this configuration features a great lower-midrange setup with an AMD Ryzen 7 8700G CPU, 6GB DDR5 Mmmory, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPU. This 27-inch 1440p monitor from LG has a well-rounded set of features and a great price, which help make it an ideal choice for most gamers, whether you need a single monitor or want to build a side-by-side setup. Alienware's AW3225QF is the first 4K QD-OLED monitor and one of the few 4K displays you can get with a 240Hz refresh rate. It's expensive but delivers stunning performance while setting a new benchmark for gaming displays. The Samsung Odyssey Neo series offers 4K image quality in a sleek and stylish package. They’re among the best gaming monitors on the market. The Asus ROG Ally is a handheld gaming PC with Windows 11. Its hardware is powerful enough to run nearly any game, but its control issues make it awkward to use. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is an excellent choice for entry-level users, casual gamers, and those shopping on a budget. Despite being one of the most affordable wireless gaming mice on the market, it doesn't compromise quality or performance, and it's almost always on sale. See more of our Black Friday roundups The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both powerful gaming consoles with similar graphical capabilities. However, they each have pros and cons. Our gaming experts think the PS5 has an edge in exclusive games, with franchises like Marvel's Spider-Man, The Last of Us, God of War, Ratchet & Clank, Astro Bot, and Ghosts of Tsushima that you can't play on Xbox systems. We also prefer the PS5's DualSense controller since it has extra perks like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Xbox consoles have their own exclusive titles as well, including Halo and Starfield, but the selection isn't as large and Microsoft is starting to experiment with releasing some of its first-party games on the PS5. However, the Xbox Series X has an edge in multimedia capabilities and its Game Pass subscription service, which offers tons of titles, including brand-new releases the day they launch in stores. Ultimately, you can't go wrong with either system, but the PS5's exclusive titles and unique controller make it a slightly better option for gamers who don't want to miss out on big releases. Check out our PS5 vs. Xbox Series X comparison for more details. Top gaming PCs and laptops feature components built to handle modern games at stable frame rates, along with support for features like ray tracing and AI upscaling. This makes them notably more expensive than typical computers designed for everyday use. High-end gaming desktops and laptops can cost more than $3,000 but entry-level options with solid specifications can be found for around $800 to $1,000. When shopping for a gaming computer the most important spec to look at is the graphics card. Nvidia and AMD are the top brands in graphics cards, and they both sell excellent options. However, Nvidia's top GPUs are typically more powerful and the company's RTX 40-series cards have a feature called "Deep Learning Super Sampling" (DLSS), which can improve frame rates with AI. Meanwhile, AMD's graphics cards tend to be a little less powerful by are also often less expensive. For the best gaming performance, we recommend focusing on PCs and laptops that have an Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card or higher. Shopping for more discounts today?

Title: ‘Very Promising Start’: Top Analyst Says Ethereum Headed Higher Against Bitcoin – Here Are His Targets

A top analyst who accurately called the end of the 2022 crypto bull market thinks Ethereum (ETH) is poised to rally in both its Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) and US dollar pairs. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 826,200 followers on the social media platform X that ETH/BTC looks good after respecting its support at 0.30 BTC. According to the crypto strategist, ETH/BTC may bounce to as high as 0.4597 BTC. “Very promising start. Let’s see if we can get to the target.” At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0373 BTC worth $3,563. As for Ethereum against the dollar, Pentoshi thinks it is within the realm of possibility for ETH to surge above $4,000. “No reason this doesn’t challenge this year’s highs, or higher in my opinion. Which likely has confluence with the ETH/BTC target posted.” He also thinks that the rally will be driven by investors allocating hundreds of millions of dollars in capital to ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Starting to become more consistent for ETH. We could see a few $250-$500 million days at some point too in the near future for this [BlackRock ETH] ETF. Had a $91 million day just in the last week. Probability of that you have to assume is very high and not far stretched at all.” Pentoshi is also keeping a close watch on the native asset of the graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering network Render (RENDER). The analyst says RENDER looks bullish after flipping a key resistance level at $8.10 as support. “Was a very short wait, RENDER flipped it, retested, and confirmed on the four-hour [chart]. Structurally a great looking chart.” At time of writing, RENDER is worth $8.61, up over 8% in the past day.

Title: How did Nvidia expand nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years?
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jesen-huang-company-workforce-growth-stock-price-climbing-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-29T12:28:00Z

Good morning! Hallam Bullock here, once again writing to you from London. Black Friday is upon us and Business Insider's Reviews team has rounded up the best deals on the products and brands they swear by. In today's newsletter, we're looking at how Nvidia expanded nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A few years ago, Nvidia was largely unknown. It's difficult to believe, considering the company can now boast about back-to-back earnings beats, a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, and a stock price that has climbed nearly 200% over the past 12 months — Citi analysts also recently eyed a catalyst that could push the stock a further 27% by January. So, how can a company grow so much, so quickly? The data behind the evolution of Nvidia's workforce tells the story, BI's Emma Cosgrove writes. Nvidia's workforce has grown nearly 20-fold since 2003. Beyond its historic rise in market value, this growth has been aided by a slew of employee incentives, including a futuristic headquarters that reflects the company's "no barriers and no boundaries" philosophy (it's easy to see why they named the building "Voyager"). This workforce growth continued through 2024, a particularly brutal year for the Tech industry, during which time Meta and Google made significant cuts. It's one of the best-paying firms in Silicon Valley. In 2019, Microsoft's median employee salary was nearly $20,000 higher than a Nvidia worker. As of January 2024, Nvidia's median salary (excluding the CEO) had surpassed Microsoft and reached more than $220,000. As the above chart illustrates, it's also left other tech giants in the dust. Nvidia's revenue per employee has recovered after years of investment. The company's revenue-to-headcount ratio showed a downward trend from 2003 until 2014, and then steady upward progress until the AI boom in 2023. During that year, this ratio doubled. This is in part due to early investment in building a programming software layer called CUDA — the main element that keeps AI builders from easily switching to competing hardware. However, the company isn't as far ahead in other areas. Gender representation in the company's workforce and the semiconductor industry as a whole has remained relatively unchanged in the last decade, Emma writes.

Russia is close to an autarky these days, and it banks are not exposed, so this is less consequential than it might seem. If I had to guess, the Russian very high inflation plays a big role, particularly if interest rates are deemed to be too low in light of that. But it may just as well have to do with technical matters, like Russia (generally? always?) requiring FX trades to be crossed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. While this greatly increases the value of Russia’s energy exports in home country terms and should boost inbound tourism, Russians who normally travel to warmer countries for vacations will likely shelve those plans for now. Historically a low rouble has been seen, like depressed stock prices, as a sign within Russia of weakness. I don’t know if that is as true now as it was historically. A more granular take: What is happening with the ruble? The ruble has experienced the most significant rate of devaluation since August 2023. Compared to the dollar, it has reached lows not seen since mid-March 2022. It's currently trading at 108.1 rubles per USD.

Maybe they even tried to steer him towards IMF loans or something. The fact that the Chinese are acting just like business people may have saved his bacon and explains why he is so happy with them. In a similar vein, from the link to Numb in India with this quote, “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.” Starmer will vote in favour IMO. Why do I predict that? Our newly elected UK Labour MP was one of the new intake that got immediate promotion to a select committee (thus annoying long-serving MPs). This has confirmed in the minds of everyone round here that he’s a Starmer …. ahem …. loyalist. He posted his letter to Twitter announcing his support in last day or so. He might have hoped it wouldn’t get noticed, given that he’s one of many Labour MPs suddenly to have new Blue-sky accounts. So I screenshot his letter and posted it to my mostly quiet Blue-sky account, tagging him. Irony is I’m probably not his least liked member of my family after my mum wrote rude stuff about him on Facebook within weeks of voting for him at the general election. All fun and games in this very marginal constituency! His track record proves he is all in for the kill https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-winter-fuel-allowance-pensioners-b2611986.html When did this phrase “assisted dying” get chosen as the message. Euthanasia just sounds bad, can’t get the dogs to.eat the dog food, but assisted dying? That’s all about the actus reus and not about the mens rea. That’s not what I would want: I would want a decriminalisation of the assistance of my suicide, with a boring paper-based process involving the court of protection and some sort of independent medical examination that I am compos mentis. I realise this rules out dementia patients and others who lack capacity but I don’t see how to resolve the dangers in allowing us to choose that others would like to die. A tolerance of the dual effect of opiates in pain relief would be one route, I suppose, provided the person acting on behalf of the incapacitated has explicitly agreed and there was no previously “do not sedate to death” paperwork. Re Russian economy: Yesterday I had a long phonecall with an excellent Russian journalist whom I have known for a long time. We talked about the prospects of an armistice and he believes that chances are quite good. Trump would give Selensky the necessary cover – “the bastard doesn´t want to deliver weapons anymore” – to call it quits and Putin is under a lot of domestic pressure because of inflation. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways and other economic troubles. I’m hoping your journalist friend is correct. I for one would appreciate moving away from the cliff edge. I propose that no one but NATO should want this result at this stage–least of all Russia. If the conflict freezes prior to the collapse of Ukraine’s military, I’ll bet we will be at war again–and worse–within a few years. Consider how emboldened the Ukrainian regime was by Putin’s restraint and miscalculations in 2022. On net NATO has not yet been chastened, but rather emboldened up to now. That is a recipe for more red-line pushing and more war. Yes. Too optimistic?- The Europeans will try to torpedo any kind of agreement. What if they decide to admit Ukraine in the EU (I am not sure this is possible) that is now seen in Russia as NATO proxy? Yea, right. MInsk 3 here we come. All because of that damned inflation, and spareparts for the railways. Economic troubles are so bad that Russians are considering selling the Crimean Bridge. Did…did you just say that if people are convinced that the west is winning in the Ukraine, that the Russians have a bridge to sell us? In typical Yankee Trader style, we will then try to purchase said bridge with gold painted BRICS. Wuk? Is that you? Punsters are proliferating on this site. Sorry, I am but a humble shadow of the refulgent Wukchumni. along with swampland in Florida – Is your contact associated wit the late J Barkley Rosser’s “contacts”? There are the similar voices saying “you did not do enough” on both sides. For the NATO side it is “not enough [effete, V-1 like] super weapons, soon enough, in numbers enough! For the Russian side: “you did not stay the course”. “Staying the course” is less insane than more V-1’s. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways […] That is sort of surprising to hear since Russian railways have their own gauge and own couplings, which means they’ve always been sort of closed market for the rolling stock. Soviet Union/Russia always (had to) build their own diesel and electric engines, so not much of replacing imports to do, really. And given the strategic significance of the railroads to the military logistics, one would be aghast to find out it has been neglected. Even more surprising is lack of problems with parts for Boeings. Please “Snowless Finns suffer ‘eco-grief” ‘Snow has special meaning for many Finns, often connected to cherished memories, but a lack of snow can cause a sense of loss that researchers refer to as eco-grief.’ It’s those damn Russians. Finland joins NATO. Then suddenly their snow starts going away. Coincidence? I think not! Does the Baltic Sea still freeze in winter, allowing one to wander for kilometers on the ice? Most of it does, but not to the extent it did in the 1950’s. I’m happy my kids have had the experience, but I’m not sure their kids will know the feeling… Damn, those pesky Russians are behind everything. This quote from Anne Karhu-Angeli caught my eye, Snow brings light with it. It’s no longer dark and horrible. You can feel it in your body and your mind,” she says. I have a friend in Alaska who every winter spends two weeks in Oaxaca to beat the endless nights. He has mentioned that this is a thing for those who can manage it, and that the extended winter nights literally drive people crazy. Same thing in all Nordic countries. During winter holidays, those who can fly away to places with a 100% sun-guarantee. Frankly, most of us endure the short period of dark, wet and cold before the permasnow falls and it’s winter wonderland everywhere. Only the weak leaves. For any military purpose they should be filtered away. The real men, wearing pants, stick around and laugh at the darkness while waiting for the snow. Photoperiod is linked to depression to which even real men in pants are susceptible. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going, laughing maniacally through the depression and snow until sometime in May. Lol, my version includes whiskey and maybe a re-read of Blood Meridian. My wife is very susceptible to Seasonal Affective Disorder while I hardly notice it at all. Mind you I haven’t ever lived north of Quebec City. Nothing weak about taking Vitamin D supplements…you don’t even have to wear pants! Yep. Remember when the Chilean trapped miners were supplied with water, food, and vitamin D, specifically, while waiting for their eventual rescue? There was a reason for that. / ;) https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna39000893 Nordic diet, oddly enough, is full of salmon, milk and eggs. Have lived here decades, never taken Vitamin D supplements. Also helps to have a fair skin tone. I am male and have lived on the coast of Alaska most of my adult life. Dont always wear pants. Winter is when i head into the woodshop crank the heat and the tunes crack a beer and start creating something. Spring comes all too soon it seems. When the sun does come out you go for a walk. Sometimes end up with the geezers at local watering hole. Good ideas start there sometimes. I know i live a blessed life. Being a member of AFDU (Alaska functional drunkards union local chapter 86). You cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning. Cheers. I once saw a funny text describing how to determine the temperature without resorting to a graded thermometer. Everything was based on what people from various countries (supposedly) do when the weather becomes colder and colder. Clues such as “Finns finally close the windows before going to sleep”, or “Even your Volvo helps you plan the trip to Tunisia” and the like. The real men, wearing pants, leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia … https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRdur8GLBM&t=6s I lived in Seattle for 35 years. I got around the dark and wet by going on bike rides in the wet and cold. It took a couple of years to figure out how dress correctly and bring multiple pairs of gloves and an extra base layer to change into. Having company to share in the fun misery also helps. For the record there was sometimes alcohol involved and herb. Before you knew it the days get a bit longer and there is light at the end of the tunnel. If possible, and many do, a get away to the SW or warmer parts are a nice option. Now that I have been south for 5 years, I am not sure if I miss it. I do miss the biking crew. Shout out to the PNW riders. Useful Idiots on RU just posted: Ukraine vs. Russia: Nuclear War, Frozen Conflict, or Peace? Debate w/ Simon Shuster Senior Correspondent at TIME Magazine Simon Shuster on newly increased aggression in the Ukraine-Russian War p.s. since I only started – Shuster as expected so far, is – well – in military terms not speaking about Ukraine but some other conflict on Venus or Pluto may be. But not this one. https://www.usefulidiotspodcast.com/p/ukraine-vs-russia-nuclear-war-frozen I wonder what others have to say to this. Because the deep-seated prejudice of Shuster is very unsettling to witness. The disagreement with Maté starts TC 20:00. 99% of what Shuster says is State Department ideology the kind of which doves share. Which is probably worse than nutty people who want to to bomb Russia but would never dare to carry that out. Shuster is undermining serious understanding and makes scrutiny of US responsibility virtually impossible in the future. One point where Maté agrees much too easily is Shuster´s allegation that Putin – of course – was lying around 2015 when neglecting RU troops in Donbas. Jacques Baud has showed that there were no covert RU supportive military operations. What is an undeniable indication that something is fundamentally wrong here – never would Shuster in this context say that e.g. Biden oder Austen or Blinken lied. Putin? YESSSS! WH? neva. p.s.When Shuster says “the genocidal regime” early on it´s hard to wonder why the interview is happening at all. What is the surplus value here? Of course their bulk audience is not just NC-commentariat. But it´s disconcerting. With this kind of mindset I see no way out of this for the next 50 years. This is a closed “cold case.” This is really distressing. Re 2015, the media was braying with one voice that Russia was sending troops and materiel to Donbass. Baud finding for the UN that there were no Russian small arms sent would seen pretty dispositive, since that would be the easiest to provide. The theory I once had, but it does not fit Baud’s facts, is that Russia might have provided deniable support, by allowing Russian soldiers to go what would otherwise be AWOL for some set time to help relatives in Donbass. There’s the evidence of the contemporary Donbass militias that they felt left alone by Russia, and the rather recent personal apology by V.V. Putin for leaving the Donbass alone supporting the narrative that Russia indeed did not provide more than diplomatic support for the militias and population that, shall we say, defended the Ukrainian constitution. That said, Russia is Russia, and as far as autocrats go, Putin has no control over what people do. So if they decide to volunteer for Donbass militias, they will. Oddly enough, there seems to be not so small anti-authoritarian inside every Russian. Shuster is crawling into the rabbit hole with every passing minute of that interview. He is insane. It is getting worse when Halper asks him about WWIII. TC 53:00. Baud revisits the 2015 issue with Eva Bartlett here (I already posted this back then): JACQUES BAUD: NATO THREATENED RUSSIA DECADES BEFORE 2022 27/10/2024 https://rumble.com/v5fjhrh-jacques-baud-nato-threatened-russia-decades-before-2022.html When I listened to it then I made following notes (I have no time now to re-check, sorry): TC – 21:00 Crimea NO green men TC – 33:00 no human rights for minorities TC – 42:00 UKR said officially 2015 no RU Army in Donbas TC – 49:00 Z´s decree 24/3/2021 to conquer South and the Donbas and that led to SMO TC – 51:00 never separatism only autonomy I take a wild guess: Not a word of this in Shuster´s book. p.s. Baud is very difficult to contact as I understand. And just because it fits: “Boris Johnson: ‘Mate, let’s face it… We’re waging a proxy war” https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862320989432160459 Bertrand: “Wow, this has got to be one of the most ‘saying the quiet part out loud’ statements since the start of the Ukraine war.” But yeah, it´s about Ukrainian agency against a genocidal regime. When did Shuster last look up the definition of genocide. Fortunately Maté didn´t ask him about Gaza. Then I would have probably smashed my computer against the wall – for lack of better – fucking – agency… Nima and Orlov. Pretty straight forward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBQhqveeXg&t=9s Time magazine was founded by Henry Luce in 1923. Luce was a big promoter of The American Century idea. https://classicsofstrategy.com/2015/09/16/the-american-century-luce/ The Time’s reportage apples haven’t fallen far from the founder’s tree, so to say. / ;) I think the US ‘deep state’ or establishment realized after this year’s US prez election that podcasts and alt media are important news outlets for a huge number of people. It’s not enough to dismiss the non-MSM as ridiculous and unimportant anymore. (The MSM made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of many over the past few years.) I expect to see more push into the alt outlets by ye olde deep state/establishment actors going forward. It’s an ironic idea that the establishment figures might try to regain credibility by going on alt media and podcasts, not necessarily to tell the truth. / ;) good point! Henry’s wife was Clair Booth Luce, famous in her day as a writer and ardent anti-communist, anti-USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce Western Europe and the US opinion of Russia hasn’t changed in 200 years. The form of govt didn’t really matter. Tzarist, Soviet, non-communist, that didn’t really matter to the West, imo. It was and is something else that matters. That something is the fact that Western mineral resources somehow got buried in Russia’s ditch. They are still missing talk radio, which is HUUGE in some parts of the country. Remember the debacle of Air America? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network) (I know it’s ‘wiki’ but, well then….) It’s all about that elusive “Big Tent” show. The Democrat/PMC Party has become based on a niche demographic. Love him or hate him, Trump has tapped into a real goldmine of “populist” angst. As Lambert says, without supplying concrete material benefits to the People as a group, not just a donor niche, the Party loses its original reason for existing. Maybe I am dating myself, but I have never listened to a podcast. I enjoyed Joe Rogan on News Radio. And, the last video game I played was Pong. I do listen to talk radio, but it’s so hard to wade through the BS. Henry Luce was the son of American missionaries to China, born in China, and returned to America in his teens. He passionately hated the Communists, and Time magazine was a huge supporter of the Vietnam war. Henry used to spike stories from his reporters in Vietnam and print handouts from the Pentagon instead. In spite of his efforts, some news from Vietnam managed to get through, but not much. After his death from a heart attack in 1968, his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, took over as publisher of his stable of magazines, and continued his anti-communist policies. Well , an entire mass media once promoted a “counterculture” by way of spawn of the military-industrial complex. ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat They know exactly what they’re doing 😂’ My god. I had forgotten that about cats. Sometimes having a cat in your home is like having an unsupervised toddler running around and not noticing them. Rev Kev Indeed! I have seen this same thing as in video! They always seem to have thought out whatever they are doing. Mine will very specifically open a certain drawer or cabinet, even a closet and go after a certain object. I have chastised myself for thinking that they are this smart. They are! I never had cats before these two and I’ve missed out on a whole world of amazing acts. I will have cats in my life forever now. Can’t believe I ever lived without them! The picture was most probably generated. Even the HTTP link looks like a prompt: “a-butterfly-with-orange-and-black-wings-on-a-beige-background”. Looks like a photo of a gift shop trinket. If you follow the “via” link, it states quite clearly that it is a 3d render, i.e. a drawing done on a computer. A new Kingdom of “creature,” the AInimalia. ‘The Redheaded libertarian @TRHLofficial The Mayflower passengers who arrived in Plymouth November 11, 1620 vs. The Mayflower passengers who survived to Thanksgiving 1621, less than one year later.’ Looking at the survivors for patterns, I can see a few. Larger families had a better chance of surviving than individuals. Women were heavily hit. And I notice more than a few children/teenagers as well surviving. Of course that is all only first impressions and would need a statistical analysis to see what the real story was. Some food for thought… https://blackagendareport.com/end-american-thanksgivings-cause-universal-rejoicing-1 The End of American Thanksgivings: A Cause for Universal Rejoicing. “The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission.” thank you, best thing Glen Ford ever wrote, and he wrote many powerful essays. You also had basically 4 groups: the Puritans, who called themselves the Saints, (everyone else was a sinner), their indentured servants, a few stragglers crazy and well heeled enough to pay their own passage (as in why did they need to really hot-tail it out of England; dunno if any had indentured servants too) and the crew. Of my at least 7 (verified by church birth and death records and/or gravestones) and as many as 11 ancestors on the Mayflower (out of 110 survivors), all were sinners. Not sure about this “saint/sinner” dichotomy. AFAIK, Pilgrim theology was pretty much orthodox Reformed, with double pre-destination meaning that there was the concept of the Elect of God. But I don’t think it was ever a belief that the Elect were/are free from sin, except in the sense of Baptism and original sin. For example the Westminster Confession Chapt 11: “4. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them. 5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and, although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.” What is missing from the discussion is the politics. Bear in mind that the King of England was the head of the Church of England (CoE) and any attempt to create a church based on your own religious ideas was not only dangerous but viewed as contempt for the monarchy and could easily land you in jail or worse. Thus, for example, Roman Catholics were automatically targeted because they looked to the Pope for religious guidance rather than the king who at the time of the Mayflower was King James I. Two groups, the Puritans and Separatists, were prominent. The Puritans wanted reform but they remained within the CoE, as well as England. The Separatists wanted freedom from the CoE, hence the name Separatists, because they saw no reason the king should be involved in religious matters. Facing arrest and persecution, the Separatists first emigrated to Holland where they lived for 12-years. When conditions in Holland became dangerous they succeeded in obtaining a contract from London for a settlement in the new world. The Separatists who left Holland and boarded the Mayflower became known as Pilgrims to distinguish them from the Separatists that remained in Europe. By 1620, Jamestown was a settlement but the Pilgrims wanted their own colony to distance themselves from the king in order to not be persecuted in the new world as they were in England. I think their rebellion against the King of England is worth remembering. Aftonbladet tells us that assisted dying is on the docket in England and its captive nation, Wales. The headline is: “British Parliament votes on euthanasia” Two thoughts: — For whom? And will there be less parading around by the members in silly costumes with props like maces? — Will anyone notice if the brain-dead English elite is euthanized? I think that we all know that assistance in dying has gone on since time immemorial. Pneumonia is called the old-man’s friend. There is a debate in Italy as to exactly what women in Sardinia who took on the roles of an abbacadora did in easing death. The irony here is that people now want to schedule their deaths. PS: Of course, zombies exist in the U.S. of A., too. Steny Hoyer, at the age of 172, was just returned to the Congress. I don’t subscribe to the idea that the voters are stupid, but I sure would like to know what kind of stun drugs are in the moo juice in southern Maryland. Tsk. It will never be the old and powerful who are urged and encouraged to ‘go.’ It will be the inconvenient, the old powerless and costly, the politically problematic who urged (maybe even pushed) to go. Simple look at what is happening in Canada. In the UK, if this passes, watch the push on the disabled or costly old people to ‘go’ as a civic duty to save the NHS. You no doubt think I’m kidding or wildly exaggerating. Reminds me of the Reichs Ministry of Racial Purity and its campaign to ‘normalize’ suicide and “assisted” suicide. All done in the interests of “The Greater Good.” When I read or hear that, I know that I should get out of there as quickly as possible. No ‘Good’ can come of it. Aktion-4 does have that neoliberal feel about it. Much of the propaganda over the “life unworthy of life” was over how much it cost the state to care for someone who was disabled. Note, the argument was not that it was unaffordable to care for the disabled, but rather that it was just expensive. Thank you, JBird4049. As someone raised in the Christian tradition of life, the idea that their are some peoples’ “life unworthy of life” is abhorrent to me on basic principles. See also the medieval Christian hospitallers (from whence comes the modern hospital idea) of charities care for the ill. Throw the ill outside the town’s gate to die, or care for them as our fellow humans. I haven’t seen any evidence of actual oversight in Canada. And if there is any, it is always post mortem… Israeli scorpion gotta 🦂 https://x.com/RaniaKhalek/status/1862397943195562124 https://thecradle.co/articles-id/27889 That article says that Hezbollah are waiting for the Lebanese army to deploy but the army itself has no illusions what the Israelis are all about. Several times during the past few weeks the Israelis deliberately murdered troops of the Lebanese army with an airstrike for no reason whatsoever. The commander of Lebanon’s Armed Forces has just briefed the government on their plans for deployment but he also refused to go into any detail or say where Lebanese soldiers would have their barracks. And that can only be because he is not willing to show his plans to the Israelis. They are quite capable of bombing a barracks full of Lebanese troops on the grounds that they are not effective enough in disarming Hezbollah forces as a sort of message- https://thecradle.co/articles/beirut-in-the-dark-about-lebanese-armys-deployment-plan-for-south-lebanon-report The AP report on Cyprus becoming a member of NATO is like some letter from some fantasy land. Cyprus is a well-kept mess for the convenience of the bigger states involved. Note the mention of Turkey having 35,000 in the occupied / breakaway north. This is on a small island with a total population of roughly one million. From WIkipedia: “The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[126]” Meanwhile, the final paragraph is a piece of self-defeat: “Cyprus’ Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.” I’m taken aback that this base is named after socialist politician Andreas Papandreou. Natch, there is no mention of the U.K. extraterritorial carved-out bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. So Cyprus is just a little Ukraine waiting to happen. Can’t see the Turks voting to let Cyprus into NATO. If it happened, that Greek part of Cyprus would be quickly overrun with NATO bases for troops and ships and would become a festung in the eastern Mediterranean. And that would mean that all sorts of pressure could be brought to bear on the Turkish part of the island, even though they are in NATO as well, and maybe forcing some sort of deal on them. That is one headache that the Turks do not need. Re: Turkey Propaganda Word on the street was that turkey outside Wilmington, NC was $0.29 / lb., so maybe that was the ‘Farm Bureau’ price. Somehow I doubt that was the price at Whole Foods. My better half bought a turkey the day before Thanksgiving for around that amount per pound, which was a heavily discounted sale price. Normally you see that price the day after, but maybe they hadn’t sold as briskly ahead of time as the store expected. She also just paid $5.00 for a dozen of the cheap eggs. Organic/cage free were quite a bit more. I showed those stats to my MIL who cooked dinner yesterday. Her dinner for 20 was well over the $116.00 the Farm Bureau estimates. Ian Welsh is clear and to the point. I have nothing else to add except that he’s spot on. The resistance will be picked apart one by one. Not so sure about that. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis have just had their a**** handed to them by Hezbollah. Remember, Hezbollah has their base in the Lebanese people and if they had let the massacres by the Israelis to continue, would have led to the loss of support of their base which is why the – temporary – truce. Hezbollah has used a fair number of their rockets up but they made to make sure that the really good stuff was kept stored. As it is, the north of Israel remains unstable and people are afraid to move back there which will roil Israeli politics. And five IDF divisions and more have been badly mauled by Hezbollah with thousands of Israeli casualties. If this is an Israeli victory, then it is a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis The current events indicate that the Syrians are just having their a**** handed back to them by an international force of jihadists amply supplied by Turkey and supported with judicious aerial attacks by Israel, and that the Palestinians are slowly but surely being exterminated without reprieve. As for Iran, it definitely does not want to be involved in a full-fledged war. The only ones possibly crazy enough to continue engaging in military operations are the Yemenis — but for how long if nobody else does? Their supplies of missiles and drones are not inexhaustible. Things are therefore not looking good at all for the Near-Eastern enemies of Israel and the USA. Thus, Israel has a not negligible probability to secure a victory — costly, prohibitively so perhaps, pyrrhic even, but a victory nevertheless. The interviewer here (Ali Alizadeh) said that there are reports that there are 10,000 Turks fighting for Israel in Gaza. The u of houston professor Fadi Kafeety did not comment on that specifically. How Yemen Became a Rising Power in West Asia? A Conversation with Fadi Kafeety https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeIR2TIHljU has anyone else heard anything about that? If the ceasefire holds it will be a victory for Israel – That may be true but, anyone, or, group, being successful in genocide and massive human rights violations – that’s not something, in my mind, to be victorious or successful about. Assuredly the dimension of time will prove it short term and disastrous – but hey, why speculate about the future and it’s outcome when the now is the deal. What risks being utterly disastrous in my mind is a world in which genocide becomes normalised and international law is dead. If Israel and the US axis get away with it, that’s what we’ll get. Harris losing was a small victory but this is the main risk for our future as a species. E.U. Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? Because they have a letter of marque. A Freedom of Anchoring exercise? Not a Coastie, but there are various authorities for boarding. See in particular Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Numb in India, part 7: Land of gloop Sam Kriss. Trust me, worth a read. A lovely read and thanks for the reminder of how good a writer Sam Kriss can be. I used to be a regular reader and somehow he fell out of my regular subscriptions (too many good things out there to keep up with). Not many westerner writers travelling in Asia provide genuinely new insights, but he is one of them. I’ve never been to Kerala, I just know of it from the lovely patient Keralan nurses who cared for my parents in years past. It has long been recognised as one of the best run Indian States, although the competition isn’t all that high. Its also a good reminder of the incredible diversity of India – there are plenty of chunks of that country as big as many other countries which are very different in culture and politics from what we usually think of as ‘India’ – the many cultures of the Himalayan foothills and plateaus as one example. There are also a surprising number of hot wars going on at any one time in the sub-continent, usually entirely unreported, even in India. The question of why India seems to have faltered while China surges is one that seems to be consuming both Indians and Chinese these days – my Chinese media feeds are full of mocking commentary on India. Some Indians seem quietly confident their country is at the beginning of a renaissance, others have their exit plans well prepared. I guess it all depends on what you think of Modi. Assuming climate change doesn’t make the sub-continent uninhabitable, its not too late, there are plenty of models in Asia for late take-offs economically – Vietnam and Indonesia in particular seem to have hit that acceleration stage and both had similar problems to India. India has its success stories. It has some of the biggest companies in the world, a vast amount of domestic talent, nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, and satellites. As well as…. all the other things we know about. But sometime around the mid 1990’s it started to fall very far behind its most obvious peer nation, in terms of raw GNP, human development and in tech. Many a book and article has been written on the topic, you can pretty much pick your theory as to why India has fallen behind according to your particular prejudice. Too much capitalism, too little capitalism, too big a state, too weak a state, colonialism, the wrong type of colonialism, cultural diversity, lack of it, the caste system, paternalistic family companies, laziness (the latter often opined by upper caste Indians), and so on. I’m something of an geographic determinist. Big continental or island States that succeed economically tend to have certain things in common – big navigable rivers or inland seas connecting natural harbours, easy to access mineral riches, good soils. India lacks many of these – it has few natural harbours, its rivers are not suitable for much transport and with some localised exceptions its soils are generally poor and unproductive without intensive labour inputs. It has plenty of coal and other minerals, but it is generally low quality and difficult to access and refine. The difficult topography of inland India always seemed to lead to lots of little feudal states historically, which proved easy for outside conquerors, with plenty of those from north of the Himalaya preceding the British. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things The God of Small Things, a Booker award winner takes place in Kerala. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_We_Imagine_as_Light All We Imagine as Light, a Cannes award winner, follows to Kerala nurses trying to make it in Mumbai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_India Kerala is the only surviving communist state in India.

There is no single tragedy at the heart of Arundhati Roy’s devastating first novel. Although ”The God of Small Things” opens with memories of a family grieving around a drowned child’s coffin, there are plenty of other intimate horrors still to come, and they compete for the reader’s sympathy with the furious energy of cats in a sack. Yet the quality of Ms. Roy’s narration is so extraordinary — at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple — that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish. This ambitious meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family is part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, and it begins at its chronological end, in a landscape of extravagant ruin. When 31-year-old Rahel Kochamma returns to Ayemenem House, her former home in the south Indian state of Kerala, its elegant windows are coated with filth and its brass doorknobs dulled with grease; dead insects lie in the bottom of its empty vases. The only animated presence in the house seems to be great-aunt Baby Kochamma’s new television set — in front of which she and her servant sit day after day, munching peanuts. Rahel has come back to Ayemenem not to see her great-aunt, however, but because she has heard that her twin brother, Estha, has unexpectedly returned. Estha and Rahel were once inseparable, but now they have been apart for almost 25 years — ever since the winter of 1969, when their English cousin, Sophie Mol, drowned in the river with their grandmother’s silver thimble in her fist. ”Perhaps it’s true that things can change in a day,” Ms. Roy’s narrator muses. ”That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house — the charred clock, the singed photograph, the scorched furniture — must be resurrected from the ruins and examined. Preserved. Accounted for.” And this is precisely Ms. Roy’s undertaking as, throughout her book, she shuttles between the twins’ past and present, continually angling in, crabwise, toward the night of Sophie Mol’s death…. https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/books/melodrama-as-structure-for-subtlety.html June 3, 1997 Melodrama as Structure for Subtlety By MICHIKO KAKUTANI THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS By Arundhati Roy ”The God of Small Things,” Arundhati Roy’s dazzling first novel, begins as a sort of mystery story. What caused the boy named Estha to stop talking? What sent his twin sister, Rahel, into exile in the United States? Why did their beautiful mother, Ammu, end up dying alone in a grimy hotel room? What killed their English cousin, Sophie Mol? And why has a ”whiff of scandal” involving sex and death come to surround their bourgeois family? While such questions may sound crudely melodramatic, they provide the narrative architecture of a novel that turns out to be as subtle as it is powerful, a novel that is Faulknerian in its ambitious tackling of family and race and class, Dickensian in its sharp-eyed observation of society and character… A millennia-long tradition of organized martial arts may have helped them retain their cultural and economic identity. Kalaripayattu. Kerala is the most lovely part of India imho. I’ve been going to India on holiday almost every year for 20 years or so, because I love it so much. Last year I decided to fly up to Ahmedabad on my way home to spend a few days. I can’t really recommend it. Only place I’ve been where the Hindutva vibe was too much to take. Good thali though and the Gandhi ashram was worth the hour it took to visit. But Kerala is fab. The ayurvedic treatment you can get there is very reasonably priced and they are not dogmatic or trying to convert you to some new lifestyle but rather help you to get better. Kochi is a lovely little city and Thiruvanathpuram (Trivandrum) is a sort of quirky state capital with a giant wooden maharajah’s palace next to a huge temple and very walkable. But the best part is just to get out to the backwaters and eat a Keralan fish curry, washed down with coconut toddy… My mind makes an association between Sam Kriss’ gloop and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop. You’re welcome. Re: ‘organ damage’ As a cardiologist with Long Covid and a fan of this blog permit me to say that it’s impossible to know what to make of the “mild atrial irregularity” without knowing the age of the patient or the nature of the “irregularity”. Millions of people had mild atrial issues long before COVID — and it correlates with age and various other items like hypertension, alcohol consumption patterns, etc. Atrial arrhythmia is one of the most overdiagnosed and overtreated cardiac ‘conditions’, and a source of much business for the electrophysiology labs that have sprouted up all over the country in the last 20 years. That said, since so much of the phenotype of Long Covid runs parallel with aging in general, it wouldn’t surprise me if an increase in atrial issues were one of the post-acute things we see. Still, I wouldn’t put it high on the list of things those of us with Long Covid need to fret about.

Hope lies with von der Leyen in Brussels.” Absurd and offensive.

Ultimate Irony Comes as Taliban Asks Russia’s Help To Evade US Sanctions, Closing 50-year Loop of Violence Antiwar.com (Kevin W) The US had spent billions arming freedom fighters to fight the Russians out of Afghanistan, … No it didn’t. US had intentionaly spent gazillions arming extremists of all sorts all around the world, knowing very well what they are, and rebranding them as freedom fighters in order to sell the lie to idi*ts. If the Russians manage to bring Afghanistan in from the cold like they are doing for North Korea, then maybe that country can develop all those mineral reserves that the Pentagon tried to use to justify the occupation and rebuild their country. Just don’t forget the real reason why the occupation- https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1547752702511263745 I once read an interview of a warlord from the Northern Alliance which I hope I had bookmarked, but no such luck, so I have no proof. But in that interview the man clearly declared that had they (mujahideen) known what would follow for Afghanistan, they certainly would have not fought “the shuravi”. I guess Taliban learned from all those mistakes. Andrew Korybko has an interesting take on Russia’s strategy re Afghanistan. The Kremlin is playing the long game, as usual. https://asiatimes.com/2024/11/russias-grand-geo-economic-plan-a-step-closer-in-afghanistan/ “Russian Ruble Collapses As Putin’s Economy in Trouble” I think that Newsweek are getting their hopes up. I don’t think that the sanctions are causing the inflation in Russia so much as the Russian economy is overheating due to it’s expansion as a wartime economy. A shortage of workers is not helping things either. Inside Russia the ruble is not a problem as that is what the workers are getting paid in so if Newsweek is hoping, like Biden, that the ruble will become rubble they may have to wait a while. Just wait until these Russian collapse stories meet the China collapse stories and have babies together. Maybe with some “at what cost” polycule added in. The data other than an artificial currency value are fine. While what matters is currency support from China, which is there along with general economic support. China is by far the largest world economy and open and inviting to Russian exchange. Russians as a number of other peoples can come and go in China with no visas and Hainan could not be a better winter refuge; even a free port refuge. Russia has made China more than energy self-sufficient, and the Russian and Chinese economies are complementary in important ways beyond energy. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/October/weo-report?c=223,924,132,134,532,534,536,158,546,922,112,111,&s=PPPGDP,PPPSH,&sy=2000&ey=2023&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Gross Domestic Product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) for Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States, 2000-2023 2023 China ( 33,552) United States ( 27,721) India ( 14,620) Russia ( 6,512) Japan ( 6,398) Germany ( 5,876) Brazil ( 4,457) Indonesia ( 4,335) France ( 4,211) United Kingdom ( 4,137) With a weak Ruble, Russian gas exports will be even cheaper in comparison to what the suckers EU will pay for strong-dollar US LNG. The ruble-Euro exchange rate on 23.02.2022 was 90.88, today it is 114.31; this is not a particularly significant change after nearly three years, especially in light of all the fireworks that have taken place. RWA’s summary is interesting. I would add one more thing, based on my 20+ years of experience importing into Russia. Every year without fail, as the new year approached, the ruble would depreciate vs the $ and Euro. Always. This drove our accountants crazy, as it made it more expensive for us to buy $/Euro (usually Euro) to pay our EU suppliers before the end of the year, and because we were pricing in Euro (though selling in rubles) it also drove up our ruble profits (i.e., more income taxes to pay). And every year, after the holidays ended after 15 January, the ruble would appreciate (usually back to its previous level). Then as now, two factors were at play: higher seasonal demand for $/Euro (Russians preparing to vacation abroad, retailers buying imported products for the holiday shopping season, trading companies settling their foreign accounts payable before the close of the year), and the Russian government gently leaning on the scales to weaken the ruble (in order to boost corporate income tax revenues across the board, a nice holiday gift for the upcoming year’s budget). I think there is nothing new under the sun. Let’s see what the exchange rates look like at the end of January 2025 before jumping to conclusions. Since January 2000, the real exchange value of Russian currency has increased by 55.7%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mvBn January 15, 2018 Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Russia, 2000-2024 (Indexed to 2000) I don’t see why Russians should be too concerned about currency fluctuations. Free floating currencies bounce all over the place for a variety of reasons. Over the last 25 years the Canadian dollar has swung from 68 cents US to 1.10 $ US and back down again. It doesn’t make much difference at the retail level for consumers but has caused serious problems for exporters when the CAD was high. Many factories have closed as a result. I should add Canada is a net energy exporter, as is Russia. For a net importer a low currency could cause serious problems.

It is required to specify a rate of change for every specific domain. Rationally progressive means embracing progress by accepting a certain rate of change deemed optimal. Too high a rate of change cancels the gains from previous mutations; while too slow a change leads to misfitness. : Pandit, Pradhan, & van Schaik: Figure 6 shows the number of feasible classes as a function of the skew in power, σ, and the original group size, N(0). … the number of feasible classes has a very weak dependence on group size. Thus, for the N(0) in the typical range of human group sizes, the number of classes only depends on σ. Intriguingly, at lower σ we expect to find more classes… The size of the upper class is largest for σ → 0 (~ half of the group), thus potentially leading to a large number of middle classes. Power.

Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? From the article” “But U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that the cables were not cut deliberately” It not something I’m up to date on, but international law on undersea cables is mostly based on the Paris Convention of 1888 (yes, thats right, 1888). In simple terms, there is an obligation on ships not do do anything that could break a cable, and its up to national governments to enforce the law on vessels registered in its country. Military ships do have the right under Article X to board a ship suspected of having broken a cable so even if the breaking was accidental, stopping and checking the Chinese ship would be lawful under the law of the sea. This Atlantic Council (booo!) article says otherwise-stating your aforementioned treaty doesn’t provide guarantees and protections for undersea cables. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/hybrid-warfare-project/international-law-doesnt-adequately-protect-undersea-cables-that-must-change/ They are not really contradictory. The right to check a vessel under any flag that is suspected of causing damage is established in Article X, but its always been ambiguous about what rights and obligations apply after the stop occurs, especially if a State actor is suspected to be involved in the damage or the ‘home’ country of the vessel involved refuses to co-operate. There has also been questions raised about other types of cable, specifically transnational electric cables, as they are not explicitly covered by the convention. High profile stops are rare, but on a more local scale in seas like the Irish Sea or Dogger Bank, stop and checks in international waters by military vessels of fishing boats suspected of dredging too near to cables happens all the time (fishermen regularly complain about this) – it doesn’t matter where the fishing boat is registered, its a well established right. It just gets ambiguous when you are dealing with contested areas as in the South China Sea or if the suspect is a military vessel -, that’s what the article is about. Re: British Parliament votes on euthanasia: I immediately thought “well they’ve mined “1984” for all it’s worth and are turning to a US novel, “Make Room Make Room”upon which the movie “Soylent Green” was based.

Any thoughts on the idea of a western sourced false flag operation in an allied state? The London camera thing is weird but no where near convincing. And would London even be the best target? Is there a euro state where the people aren’t fully on board with project Ukraine and a massive event would act to pull the West together? Perhaps blowing up the Hague would accomplish multiple things at the same time? First, because of the UK’s role in NATO’s war on Russia, London will be one of Russia’s three most obvious targets, two of which are in the UK, amongst all the possible targets throughout the Collective West; second, the British security services are best placed and most motivated to organise a false flag; third, the UK’s Parliament and population are incredibly gullible (note the ease with which the ridiculous explanation of the Skripal affair has been accepted); and fourth, it was planned before the Oresnik strike when the various intelligence services still thought that the public would accept that Russia would use a nuke. The problem the West has now is that Russia could take out ALL the decision-making centres (and population centres) in Europe without nukes and the only possible source of effective (that is, nuclear) retaliation would be the US, and that would be disastrous for the US, so the US would consider Article 5, as it is obliged to do, and say “No thanks, old buddies. The war against Russia is now strictly a European affair”. There was a pamphlet about the decline of the UK published by Encounter magazine, a CIA front, in the fifties entitled, as I remember, “Suicide of a Nation” (God knows where it is among my shelves). The title was, of course, metaphorical. The question now is whether the Brits are prepared to play a game of Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. Unfortunately, the answer will most likely be that the ideologically driven incompetents who’ve been running this war beyond the reach of sanity will say, “Yes, please. I’ll go first, so pass me the gun”. I have to admit that I did not understand how virulently various interests in the UK hated the Russians. I’ve been amazed to watch my UK friends post meme after meme describing how awful the Russians are and how we should just annihilate them all. It makes me think that western leaders will only be happy when Gaza is full of ghosts and Russia is a graveyard. I seem to have missed some crucial Britishness classes because I have never felt this way. And I really don’t see where my compatriots have got this from. However, I did have a New Year’s party in Dec 2022 which nearly ruined a thirty year friendship group when it turned out that two of us (me + gold trader) took Russia’s side and two of us (particle physics professor and healthcare informatics / pandemic data analysis PhD) took the Ukraine’s. We were shocked by their fact-free convictions. We have agreed not to speak of it again! Actually, if you do a YT search about the CCD cameras in London; you’ll find many videos stating that they have been off-line for the past 85 days or more, not just 24 hours. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but then again, what reporter nowadays would dare to ask the question? I say, “off-line” because the theory is that they’re still working, just no longer accessible to the public (nor to the regular police either, for some reason). Commenters on these videos have stated that a similar thing has happened in Manchester, and I believe Bristol. Apparently, MI-5/6 has form on this because the CCD cameras around London were supposedly not operating on the day of 7/7 either. I’m just repeating what the YTubers have been saying on this last bit, but they’re all pretty insistent on this. Who knows what the truth is anymore? For anyone who wants to have some real fun; do a YT search about those drones that have been showing up at UK airports. The false flag theory is plausible but if the goal is all-out war with Russia, western war planners once again fail to take everything into account. I, an average guy living an average life, know for near certain that a co-ordinated allied attack on Russia would be met with a similar mobilisation from China. It’s just obvious that China’s best interests are Russia not falling into western hands and getting used in turn to isolate China.

However, he is kind of a one-trick “lawfare” pony. Regular machinations of the Federalist Society or ALEC appear to escape his eagle-eye. It’s unbecoming for a person to speak out of one side of his mouth, but it’s a regular thing for lawyers. Business articles persisting in the myth that xmas shopping begins after Thanksgiving. I guess they never venture out themselves to see the first of the Xmas displays being set up around labor day and the store being fully overwhelmed with yuletide expressions right around halloween. There is no longer a black Friday but rather, a black November. If the supposed holiday seasons’ sales are less than than stellar, retail has no one to blame but themselves as they have cannibalize the season with an uber-long ramp up. https://www.axios.com/2024/11/27/americans-consumer-spending-holiday-season This is more than a panic reaction. It seems my government is really committed to WW3: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/abandoning-ukraine-infinitely-higher-costs-head-of-mi6 When a minimizer of the ongoing Pandemic is worried about H5N1, that is a sight to behold. A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History – Zeynep Tufekci And it is not paywalled, either, which is extremely rare at NY Times. Rest assured, after H5N1 hits, she’ll be minimizing yet another Pandemic, if it turns out people don’t turn blue and explode. None the less, clearly some subset of the elite are rightly freaking out. Just a few weeks ago, a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu. It seems to have gotten it from sick poultry on the same farm. Pigs cause extra worry because they are considered to be ideal mixing vessels for various animal flu viruses to adapt and spread among humans. Last week, the virus was found in a flock of ducks at a pet fair in Hawaii, the one state that hadn’t previously found a case — likely transmitted by wild birds, which continue to spread the illness far and wide. Of the 34 individuals who had been exposed at that pet fair, including 13 who had respiratory symptoms, all were offered voluntary testing. Five declined. A teenager in Canada was infected, and the virus showed some key mutations that bring it closer to adapting to spread among humans. This outbreak has so far been mostly mild in humans, but historically it has been deadly, and further mutations could make it so again. That Canadian is in critical condition, unable to breathe independently. There’s also an infected child in California who was not known to have come into contact with any sick animals at all, which raises the terrifying possibility that he got it from another human being. And the virus levels in the wastewater in several states keep spiking. We’ve definitely arrived at the bucket-up phase of this. One thing I keep in mind about the “Collective Biden” is that the husk alone has had Covid 3 times, Dr Jill has had it several times and Blinken, Sullivan and the rest have had it several times as well. This may have something to do with why the USA is now in a shooting War with Russia and it does not bode well for the future. Maybe we’ll get lucky… This was also reported by TASS but no sign in mainstream media in the states… https://news-pravda.com/world/2024/11/28/886216.html “Up to 40 specialists from the USA were destroyed”: The Ministry of Defense revealed details of the retaliatory strike against Ukraine The Ministry of Defense told what losses the Ukrainian side suffered after Russia’s retaliatory strike against attacks with long-range ATACMS missiles. According to the ministry, on November 28, the Russian Armed Forces launched a comprehensive attack on defense and industrial facilities, as well as the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. In addition, on November 25 and 26, Iskander ballistic missiles destroyed ATACMS launchers, installations with experimental samples of Grom-2 missiles, as well as a transport and loading vehicle of the Neptune anti-ship complex. In addition, during the attack, Russian missiles landed directly at the headquarters of the Main Intelligence Directorate “Kraken” in Kharkov. As a result of the strike, up to 40 foreign specialists were eliminated, most of whom were specialists from the United States. From A strange new climate era is beginning to take hold It will be those investments — and the energy choices of up-and-coming developing nations — that will determine the future of the planet. So WaPo basically blames developing nations, Trump tariffs, AI, whatever, the blame directed everywhere except at the capitalist class itself. No, the solution to climate is to terminate capitalism. Instead we’re all gonna burn alive. Without a serious discussion of what all of this energy usage is in service of, and what people really need to live a decent life, there won’t be any worthwhile progress on avoiding an extinction level event. Good stuff. As much as I like the the idea of Putin as Cobra Commander holding the West hostage, it makes about as much sense as the more hyperbolic claims about the Oreshnik. We already have decades of research and experimental data on fairly similar cases: 1) On the low end, large sabot penetrators (tungsten or depleted uranium): 10kg at Mach 5-6 2) On the high end, HEAT warhead penetrators (copper): 1kg at Mach 15-25 Neither of these cause destruction by mystical waves of pressure or heat. The damage is purely kinetic: direct impact and spalled fragments of whatever they hit. A 100kg* penetrator travelling at Mach 10 will cause proportionately scaled damage–but it is not remotely comparable to a nuclear weapon. At least, that seems like the safest assumption unless we see dramatic evidence to the contrary. * The throw weight of a Bulava at max range is 1,000 kg bus and warheads, but let’s be generous and assume something with more weight and less range. (This was meant as a reply to AG’s GI Joe clip, but it looks like I missed it). Since you mention COBRA – your post could either be about Covid OR Oreshnik. p.s. Did Putin not state that several Oreshniks could cause as much destruction as a tactical nuke? If so I don´t know what value of a nuke´s powers he was referring to. Fission is a different beast altogether. But with conventional destructive capabalities added? Yes, that’s right. Let’s do some rough math (hopefully correctly) and see where this might be coming from: A small nuke = a kiloton of TNT = 4.2E12 joules A 100kg* penetrator traveling at Mach 10 = 5.9E8 36 penetrators in an Oreshnik = 2.1E10 100 Oreshniks (or just 10 Oreshniks if it is a big missile) = 2.1E12 It seems that Putin is doing a sleight of hand that several others have done to impress the folks at home. You add up the joules of energy from a vast number of penetrators with such and such weight and velocity and eventually you get an impressive number. But it doesn’t add up to quite as much practical destructive force as the number implies. And even then, Putin must have been using numbers from a small tactical nuke. * 100kg is just a guess. If the missile is small, they couldn’t be much heavier, but a big short ranged missile could carry 10x more weight. What do you want to destroy? Counter force or counter value? Critical issue is accuracy of penetrators. If you have 18 hard targets (assign 2 “penetrators” to each) spread around the area of Hiroshima, you can achieve results equal to a 20 kt bombs. Would as air burst have gotten deep vaults? Jeffrey Lewis on TWITTER tried to ridicule the Oreshnik a bit by describing that buildings that were not targeted but were next to where the factotry was located had suffered cracks. Thus it was a bad weapon and the claims of accuracy fraudulent. I don´t understand these people. Why do scientists have to act like propagandists. It reminds of the German nuclear phyisicists when they were interned in Farm Hall in 1945 and were mocking US and others as not able to pull off a nuke before August 6th shell-shocked them… Kinetic penetrators were never about sheer energy, but about focusing it in a small area. They can get much deeper than surface explosion can. Comparing just energies of different projectile types is like comparing just GDPs of countries. Here’s a math problem. How big would a surface detonation have to be, in order to destroy underground bunker that one Oreshnik kinetic penetrator can? re: Project Zeus Did Zeus eat hazelnuts? I don´t think so. They are not your typical Greek flora, or are they? Most of the calculations I’ve seen compare the energy delivered by the mach 10 mass to that of kilotons of TNT, like nukes. Putin claimed that the temperature of the mass was 4000° which is above the melting point of most metals, and the plasma envelope around it was evident. That added thermal energy, and the dynamics of a plasma shielded molten blob might lead to some interesting effects not obvious from more mundane experiments. I agree with you that this is more than it seems. It is only a closed system in a vacuum. Passing through the atmosphere the air resistance creates the friction that generates this heat. That is likely adding to the net effect of the explosion but not figured into the equation. Metallurgists know about the molecular changes that take place above critical temperatures making some stainless steels magnetic and some non-magnetic. When tool steels (normally cubic-centered structures) reach critical temperatures they become austenitic (face-centered cubic grain structure) and lose their magnetism. Unknown changes are probably generated by this heat to the unknown substance of these rods, but it has been tested in Russia. Deferring to people who have practical experience in this is not magical thinking but pragmatic. I have seen several suggestions that the process at the end is magnetohydrodynamics, no official word yet. The scientist in charge is saying that currently they operate at 2,200deg. centigrade but theory lets them hope to get it up to 3,000 deg centigrade. i.e. Mach 15 @ Wisker. About the only realistic assessment I’ve read here. One has only to look at the published pictures of the above ground buildings at Yukhmash to see the sturdy Soviet era buildings have hardly “turned to dust”. Some caught fire from the white hot heat of passing projectiles. Subsequent descriptions of clusters of projectile holes in the ground where they missed a building have turned up. Nobody seems to have dug down to have a look at the “destruction” below. Hardly worth the bother. But, the general belief here is that somehow the projectiles from Oreshnik have kiloton nuclear bomb power. I’ll repeat again for the more dense folks here who seem to believe in magic: The final energy of the rod projectiles cannot exceed that of the chemical energy released by the missile’s rocket motors. Period. It is a closed system and the Law of Conservation of Energy applies. If 40 tonnes of rocket fuel, expended all at once, like in blowing up on the launch pad, is equivalent to several kilotons of TNT, I’m a monkey’s uncle. But if fairy tales make you happy, so be it. And the same goes for Putin. The advantage of Oreshnik is the super fast delivery time of an actual nuke on target from a mobile launcher. Now that indeed is a concern for Western “strategists” who might be awake. If indeed, any competent ones are on the job who are not beholden to the party line like MSM journalists who are unconsciously adept at writing “stuff” that pleases their overlords. And no, I am not making shit up. Others are. I don’t know where people are getting kilotons out of this weapon. I’ve seen, and my own crude calculations produce, multi-ton-level per 75-100kg munition, with that energy focused in a cone along the direction of travel like a large hammer blow. The highest I’ve seen is 11 tons per munition, and I suspect that’s too big, although the Ukrainians estimated velocity at 11.0 to 11.4 km/s, a lot higher than other reports, and energy is velocity squared. Assuming no more than 10 tons tnt equivalent/munition, that’s less than 360 tons tnt per device. That’s still a lot. What’s even more interesting is how tight the sheaf of the impact appears to be. If that’s the case, this weapon is incredibly precise (if not accurate) especially for its velocity. Whatever is below the impact points is going to be crushed. Explosives used in that tight of a sheaf impacting within a second of each other might cause less damage due to interference, whether that be due to phase cancellation or blowing up the following warheads or other factors. This is an interesting weapon system for sure, but probably not even close to kiloton yield even in aggregate. That’s still enough to utterly destroy something on the receiving end, and do so efficiently. Your point is valid and I am sceptical of these claims but should we also consider something like “energy flux”, i.e. the impact is vertical and focused in a narrow cone around the falling projectile, rather than a spherical explosion, increasing the damage in a directional way? If it is focused in a cone with 1/10th the radius of a spherical explosion, the “flux” is ~ 100x greater (I am modelling it as a passing through a flat circle rather than a small spherical surface). Michael von der Schulenburg with acid comment on EU in BERLINER ZEITUNG: Ukraine War: New EU Resolution Brings Europe to the Brink of World War III https://archive.is/wwzU3 Finale: This resolution is a document full of hatred, panic and hysteria – a shameful expression of irresponsibility and a lack of empathy for the many victims of such war hysteria. There is nothing in it for us Europeans to be proud of. Fortunately, this resolution is unlikely to have any direct political impact on the war in Ukraine. The European Parliament has simply demonstrated once again that it behaves like a “dummy decision-maker” on many issues – in this case, fortunately for all of us. For me, who has always been an ardent supporter of the European idea, it is painful to listen to the debates of a war-mongering and hate-filled parliamentary majority. I then ask myself: what kind of monster have we created with the EU? I believe this is the full text of the resolution: JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on reinforcing EU’s unwavering support to Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression and the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia This is just an embarrassing display of political, economic and social delusion and, as mi mam used to say, “Fine words don’t butter no parsnips”. But stupidity can elicit a tree full of hazelnuts. Good multi language pun! It is a monster which will either remain subservient to the US, or will gradually implode and it’s members will part company with each other, or both; or it could simply recognise reality and either implode or remains in some form as abstract in it’s realty as it’s model, the Holy Roman Empire, accepting that it is the inferior in terms of it’s relationships with Russia and China – on whom it is dependent if it’s inhabitants are to enjoy a standard of living anywhere approaching the standard they enjoy today which, of course, for most people means a standard lower than that of 2021. Just started reading that wonderful post about Kerala. A thing about it that kind of lights me up a bit, and I think may not be mentioned in the piece itself, is it’s proximity to the upcoming north/south transport corridor that will bypass Suez and go all the way to Russia, IIRC. The port of Chabahar in Iran is where it will start. This looks set to be an interesting corner of the world as the near future unfolds. I’m looking forward to watching how things develop.

Russia is close to an autarky these days, and it banks are not exposed, so this is less consequential than it might seem. If I had to guess, the Russian very high inflation plays a big role, particularly if interest rates are deemed to be too low in light of that. But it may just as well have to do with technical matters, like Russia (generally? always?) requiring FX trades to be crossed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. While this greatly increases the value of Russia’s energy exports in home country terms and should boost inbound tourism, Russians who normally travel to warmer countries for vacations will likely shelve those plans for now. Historically a low rouble has been seen, like depressed stock prices, as a sign within Russia of weakness. I don’t know if that is as true now as it was historically.

Maybe they even tried to steer him towards IMF loans or something. The fact that the Chinese are acting just like business people may have saved his bacon and explains why he is so happy with them. In a similar vein, from the link to Numb in India with this quote, “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.” Starmer will vote in favour IMO. Why do I predict that? Our newly elected UK Labour MP was one of the new intake that got immediate promotion to a select committee (thus annoying long-serving MPs). This has confirmed in the minds of everyone round here that he’s a Starmer …. ahem …. loyalist. He posted his letter to Twitter announcing his support in last day or so. He might have hoped it wouldn’t get noticed, given that he’s one of many Labour MPs suddenly to have new Blue-sky accounts. So I screenshot his letter and posted it to my mostly quiet Blue-sky account, tagging him.

Euthanasia just sounds bad, can’t get the dogs to.eat the dog food, but assisted dying? That’s all about the actus reus and not about the mens rea. That’s not what I would want: I would want a decriminalisation of the assistance of my suicide, with a boring paper-based process involving the court of protection and some sort of independent medical examination that I am compos mentis. I realise this rules out dementia patients and others who lack capacity but I don’t see how to resolve the dangers in allowing us to choose that others would like to die. A tolerance of the dual effect of opiates in pain relief would be one route, I suppose, provided the person acting on behalf of the incapacitated has explicitly agreed and there was no previously “do not sedate to death” paperwork. Re Russian economy: Yesterday I had a long phonecall with an excellent Russian journalist whom I have known for a long time. We talked about the prospects of an armistice and he believes that chances are quite good. Trump would give Selensky the necessary cover – “the bastard doesn´t want to deliver weapons anymore” – to call it quits and Putin is under a lot of domestic pressure because of inflation. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways and other economic troubles. I’m hoping your journalist friend is correct. I for one would appreciate moving away from the cliff edge. I propose that no one but NATO should want this result at this stage–least of all Russia. If the conflict freezes prior to the collapse of Ukraine’s military, I’ll bet we will be at war again–and worse–within a few years. Consider how emboldened the Ukrainian regime was by Putin’s restraint and miscalculations in 2022. On net NATO has not yet been chastened, but rather emboldened up to now. That is a recipe for more red-line pushing and more war. Yes. Too optimistic?- The Europeans will try to torpedo any kind of agreement. What if they decide to admit Ukraine in the EU (I am not sure this is possible) that is now seen in Russia as NATO proxy? Yea, right. MInsk 3 here we come. All because of that damned inflation, and spareparts for the railways. Economic troubles are so bad that Russians are considering selling the Crimean Bridge. Did…did you just say that if people are convinced that the west is winning in the Ukraine, that the Russians have a bridge to sell us? In typical Yankee Trader style, we will then try to purchase said bridge with gold painted BRICS. Wuk? Is that you? Punsters are proliferating on this site. Sorry, I am but a humble shadow of the refulgent Wukchumni. along with swampland in Florida – Is your contact associated wit the late J Barkley Rosser’s “contacts”? There are the similar voices saying “you did not do enough” on both sides. For the NATO side it is “not enough [effete, V-1 like] super weapons, soon enough, in numbers enough! For the Russian side: “you did not stay the course”. “Staying the course” is less insane than more V-1’s. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways […] That is sort of surprising to hear since Russian railways have their own gauge and own couplings, which means they’ve always been sort of closed market for the rolling stock. Soviet Union/Russia always (had to) build their own diesel and electric engines, so not much of replacing imports to do, really. And given the strategic significance of the railroads to the military logistics, one would be aghast to find out it has been neglected. Even more surprising is lack of problems with parts for Boeings. Please “Snowless Finns suffer ‘eco-grief” ‘Snow has special meaning for many Finns, often connected to cherished memories, but a lack of snow can cause a sense of loss that researchers refer to as eco-grief.’ It’s those damn Russians. Finland joins NATO. Then suddenly their snow starts going away. Coincidence? I think not! Does the Baltic Sea still freeze in winter, allowing one to wander for kilometers on the ice? Most of it does, but not to the extent it did in the 1950’s. I’m happy my kids have had the experience, but I’m not sure their kids will know the feeling… Damn, those pesky Russians are behind everything. This quote from Anne Karhu-Angeli caught my eye, Snow brings light with it. It’s no longer dark and horrible. You can feel it in your body and your mind,” she says. I have a friend in Alaska who every winter spends two weeks in Oaxaca to beat the endless nights. He has mentioned that this is a thing for those who can manage it, and that the extended winter nights literally drive people crazy. Same thing in all Nordic countries. During winter holidays, those who can fly away to places with a 100% sun-guarantee. Frankly, most of us endure the short period of dark, wet and cold before the permasnow falls and it’s winter wonderland everywhere. Only the weak leaves. For any military purpose they should be filtered away. The real men, wearing pants, stick around and laugh at the darkness while waiting for the snow. Photoperiod is linked to depression to which even real men in pants are susceptible.

It took a couple of years to figure out how dress correctly and bring multiple pairs of gloves and an extra base layer to change into. Having company to share in the fun misery also helps. For the record there was sometimes alcohol involved and herb. Before you knew it the days get a bit longer and there is light at the end of the tunnel. If possible, and many do, a get away to the SW or warmer parts are a nice option. Now that I have been south for 5 years, I am not sure if I miss it. I do miss the biking crew. Shout out to the PNW riders. Useful Idiots on RU just posted: Ukraine vs. Russia: Nuclear War, Frozen Conflict, or Peace? Debate w/ Simon Shuster Senior Correspondent at TIME Magazine Simon Shuster on newly increased aggression in the Ukraine-Russian War p.s. since I only started – Shuster as expected so far, is – well – in military terms not speaking about Ukraine but some other conflict on Venus or Pluto may be. But not this one. https://www.usefulidiotspodcast.com/p/ukraine-vs-russia-nuclear-war-frozen I wonder what others have to say to this. Because the deep-seated prejudice of Shuster is very unsettling to witness. The disagreement with Maté starts TC 20:00. 99% of what Shuster says is State Department ideology the kind of which doves share. Which is probably worse than nutty people who want to to bomb Russia but would never dare to carry that out. Shuster is undermining serious understanding and makes scrutiny of US responsibility virtually impossible in the future. One point where Maté agrees much too easily is Shuster´s allegation that Putin – of course – was lying around 2015 when neglecting RU troops in Donbas. Jacques Baud has showed that there were no covert RU supportive military operations. What is an undeniable indication that something is fundamentally wrong here – never would Shuster in this context say that e.g. Biden oder Austen or Blinken lied. Putin? YESSSS! WH? neva. p.s.When Shuster says “the genocidal regime” early on it´s hard to wonder why the interview is happening at all. What is the surplus value here? Of course their bulk audience is not just NC-commentariat. But it´s disconcerting. With this kind of mindset I see no way out of this for the next 50 years. This is a closed “cold case.” This is really distressing. Re 2015, the media was braying with one voice that Russia was sending troops and materiel to Donbass. Baud finding for the UN that there were no Russian small arms sent would seen pretty dispositive, since that would be the easiest to provide. The theory I once had, but it does not fit Baud’s facts, is that Russia might have provided deniable support, by allowing Russian soldiers to go what would otherwise be AWOL for some set time to help relatives in Donbass. There’s the evidence of the contemporary Donbass militias that they felt left alone by Russia, and the rather recent personal apology by V.V. Putin for leaving the Donbass alone supporting the narrative that Russia indeed did not provide more than diplomatic support for the militias and population that, shall we say, defended the Ukrainian constitution. That said, Russia is Russia, and as far as autocrats go, Putin has no control over what people do. So if they decide to volunteer for Donbass militias, they will. Oddly enough, there seems to be not so small anti-authoritarian inside every Russian. Shuster is crawling into the rabbit hole with every passing minute of that interview. He is insane. It is getting worse when Halper asks him about WWIII. TC 53:00. Baud revisits the 2015 issue with Eva Bartlett here (I already posted this back then): JACQUES BAUD: NATO THREATENED RUSSIA DECADES BEFORE 2022 27/10/2024 https://rumble.com/v5fjhrh-jacques-baud-nato-threatened-russia-decades-before-2022.html When I listened to it then I made following notes (I have no time now to re-check, sorry): TC – 21:00 Crimea NO green men TC – 33:00 no human rights for minorities TC – 42:00 UKR said officially 2015 no RU Army in Donbas TC – 49:00 Z´s decree 24/3/2021 to conquer South and the Donbas and that led to SMO TC – 51:00 never separatism only autonomy I take a wild guess: Not a word of this in Shuster´s book. p.s. Baud is very difficult to contact as I understand. And just because it fits: “Boris Johnson: ‘Mate, let’s face it… We’re waging a proxy war” https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862320989432160459 Bertrand: “Wow, this has got to be one of the most ‘saying the quiet part out loud’ statements since the start of the Ukraine war.” But yeah, it´s about Ukrainian agency against a genocidal regime. When did Shuster last look up the definition of genocide. Fortunately Maté didn´t ask him about Gaza. Then I would have probably smashed my computer against the wall – for lack of better – fucking – agency… Nima and Orlov. Pretty straight forward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBQhqveeXg&t=9s Time magazine was founded by Henry Luce in 1923. Luce was a big promoter of The American Century idea. https://classicsofstrategy.com/2015/09/16/the-american-century-luce/ The Time’s reportage apples haven’t fallen far from the founder’s tree, so to say. / ;) I think the US ‘deep state’ or establishment realized after this year’s US prez election that podcasts and alt media are important news outlets for a huge number of people. It’s not enough to dismiss the non-MSM as ridiculous and unimportant anymore. (The MSM made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of many over the past few years.) I expect to see more push into the alt outlets by ye olde deep state/establishment actors going forward. It’s an ironic idea that the establishment figures might try to regain credibility by going on alt media and podcasts, not necessarily to tell the truth. / ;) good point! Henry’s wife was Clair Booth Luce, famous in her day as a writer and ardent anti-communist, anti-USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce Western Europe and the US opinion of Russia hasn’t changed in 200 years. The form of govt didn’t really matter. Tzarist, Soviet, non-communist, that didn’t really matter to the West, imo. It was and is something else that matters. That something is the fact that Western mineral resources somehow got buried in Russia’s ditch. They are still missing talk radio, which is HUUGE in some parts of the country. Remember the debacle of Air America? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network) (I know it’s ‘wiki’ but, well then….) It’s all about that elusive “Big Tent” show. The Democrat/PMC Party has become based on a niche demographic. Love him or hate him, Trump has tapped into a real goldmine of “populist” angst. As Lambert says, without supplying concrete material benefits to the People as a group, not just a donor niche, the Party loses its original reason for existing. Maybe I am dating myself, but I have never listened to a podcast. I enjoyed Joe Rogan on News Radio. And, the last video game I played was Pong. I do listen to talk radio, but it’s so hard to wade through the BS. Henry Luce was the son of American missionaries to China, born in China, and returned to America in his teens. He passionately hated the Communists, and Time magazine was a huge supporter of the Vietnam war. Henry used to spike stories from his reporters in Vietnam and print handouts from the Pentagon instead. In spite of his efforts, some news from Vietnam managed to get through, but not much. After his death from a heart attack in 1968, his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, took over as publisher of his stable of magazines, and continued his anti-communist policies. Well , an entire mass media once promoted a “counterculture” by way of spawn of the military-industrial complex. ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat They know exactly what they’re doing 😂’ My god. I had forgotten that about cats. Sometimes having a cat in your home is like having an unsupervised toddler running around and not noticing them. Rev Kev Indeed! I have seen this same thing as in video! They always seem to have thought out whatever they are doing. Mine will very specifically open a certain drawer or cabinet, even a closet and go after a certain object. I have chastised myself for thinking that they are this smart. They are! I never had cats before these two and I’ve missed out on a whole world of amazing acts. I will have cats in my life forever now. Can’t believe I ever lived without them! The picture was most probably generated. Even the HTTP link looks like a prompt: “a-butterfly-with-orange-and-black-wings-on-a-beige-background”. Looks like a photo of a gift shop trinket.

A new Kingdom of “creature,” the AInimalia. ‘The Redheaded libertarian @TRHLofficial The Mayflower passengers who arrived in Plymouth November 11, 1620 vs. The Mayflower passengers who survived to Thanksgiving 1621, less than one year later.’ Looking at the survivors for patterns, I can see a few. Larger families had a better chance of surviving than individuals. Women were heavily hit. And I notice more than a few children/teenagers as well surviving. Of course that is all only first impressions and would need a statistical analysis to see what the real story was. Some food for thought… https://blackagendareport.com/end-american-thanksgivings-cause-universal-rejoicing-1 The End of American Thanksgivings: A Cause for Universal Rejoicing. “The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission.” thank you, best thing Glen Ford ever wrote, and he wrote many powerful essays. You also had basically 4 groups: the Puritans, who called themselves the Saints, (everyone else was a sinner), their indentured servants, a few stragglers crazy and well heeled enough to pay their own passage (as in why did they need to really hot-tail it out of England; dunno if any had indentured servants too) and the crew. Of my at least 7 (verified by church birth and death records and/or gravestones) and as many as 11 ancestors on the Mayflower (out of 110 survivors), all were sinners. Not sure about this “saint/sinner” dichotomy. AFAIK, Pilgrim theology was pretty much orthodox Reformed, with double pre-destination meaning that there was the concept of the Elect of God. But I don’t think it was ever a belief that the Elect were/are free from sin, except in the sense of Baptism and original sin. For example the Westminster Confession Chapt 11: “4. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them. 5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and, although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.” What is missing from the discussion is the politics. Bear in mind that the King of England was the head of the Church of England (CoE) and any attempt to create a church based on your own religious ideas was not only dangerous but viewed as contempt for the monarchy and could easily land you in jail or worse. Thus, for example, Roman Catholics were automatically targeted because they looked to the Pope for religious guidance rather than the king who at the time of the Mayflower was King James I. Two groups, the Puritans and Separatists, were prominent. The Puritans wanted reform but they remained within the CoE, as well as England. The Separatists wanted freedom from the CoE, hence the name Separatists, because they saw no reason the king should be involved in religious matters. Facing arrest and persecution, the Separatists first emigrated to Holland where they lived for 12-years. When conditions in Holland became dangerous they succeeded in obtaining a contract from London for a settlement in the new world. The Separatists who left Holland and boarded the Mayflower became known as Pilgrims to distinguish them from the Separatists that remained in Europe. By 1620, Jamestown was a settlement but the Pilgrims wanted their own colony to distance themselves from the king in order to not be persecuted in the new world as they were in England. I think their rebellion against the King of England is worth remembering. Aftonbladet tells us that assisted dying is on the docket in England and its captive nation, Wales. The headline is: “British Parliament votes on euthanasia” Two thoughts: — For whom? And will there be less parading around by the members in silly costumes with props like maces? — Will anyone notice if the brain-dead English elite is euthanized? I think that we all know that assistance in dying has gone on since time immemorial. Pneumonia is called the old-man’s friend. There is a debate in Italy as to exactly what women in Sardinia who took on the roles of an abbacadora did in easing death. The irony here is that people now want to schedule their deaths. PS: Of course, zombies exist in the U.S. of A., too. Steny Hoyer, at the age of 172, was just returned to the Congress. I don’t subscribe to the idea that the voters are stupid, but I sure would like to know what kind of stun drugs are in the moo juice in southern Maryland. Tsk. It will never be the old and powerful who are urged and encouraged to ‘go.’ It will be the inconvenient, the old powerless and costly, the politically problematic who urged (maybe even pushed) to go. Simple look at what is happening in Canada. In the UK, if this passes, watch the push on the disabled or costly old people to ‘go’ as a civic duty to save the NHS. You no doubt think I’m kidding or wildly exaggerating. Reminds me of the Reichs Ministry of Racial Purity and its campaign to ‘normalize’ suicide and “assisted” suicide. All done in the interests of “The Greater Good.” When I read or hear that, I know that I should get out of there as quickly as possible. No ‘Good’ can come of it. Aktion-4 does have that neoliberal feel about it. Much of the propaganda over the “life unworthy of life” was over how much it cost the state to care for someone who was disabled. Note, the argument was not that it was unaffordable to care for the disabled, but rather that it was just expensive. Thank you, JBird4049. As someone raised in the Christian tradition of life, the idea that their are some peoples’ “life unworthy of life” is abhorrent to me on basic principles. See also the medieval Christian hospitallers (from whence comes the modern hospital idea) of charities care for the ill. Throw the ill outside the town’s gate to die, or care for them as our fellow humans. I haven’t seen any evidence of actual oversight in Canada. And if there is any, it is always post mortem… Israeli scorpion gotta 🦂 https://x.com/RaniaKhalek/status/1862397943195562124 https://thecradle.co/articles-id/27889 That article says that Hezbollah are waiting for the Lebanese army to deploy but the army itself has no illusions what the Israelis are all about. Several times during the past few weeks the Israelis deliberately murdered troops of the Lebanese army with an airstrike for no reason whatsoever. The commander of Lebanon’s Armed Forces has just briefed the government on their plans for deployment but he also refused to go into any detail or say where Lebanese soldiers would have their barracks. And that can only be because he is not willing to show his plans to the Israelis. They are quite capable of bombing a barracks full of Lebanese troops on the grounds that they are not effective enough in disarming Hezbollah forces as a sort of message- https://thecradle.co/articles/beirut-in-the-dark-about-lebanese-armys-deployment-plan-for-south-lebanon-report The AP report on Cyprus becoming a member of NATO is like some letter from some fantasy land. Cyprus is a well-kept mess for the convenience of the bigger states involved. Note the mention of Turkey having 35,000 in the occupied / breakaway north. This is on a small island with a total population of roughly one million. From WIkipedia: “The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[126]” Meanwhile, the final paragraph is a piece of self-defeat: “Cyprus’ Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.” I’m taken aback that this base is named after socialist politician Andreas Papandreou. Natch, there is no mention of the U.K. extraterritorial carved-out bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. So Cyprus is just a little Ukraine waiting to happen. Can’t see the Turks voting to let Cyprus into NATO. If it happened, that Greek part of Cyprus would be quickly overrun with NATO bases for troops and ships and would become a festung in the eastern Mediterranean. And that would mean that all sorts of pressure could be brought to bear on the Turkish part of the island, even though they are in NATO as well, and maybe forcing some sort of deal on them. That is one headache that the Turks do not need. Re: Turkey Propaganda Word on the street was that turkey outside Wilmington, NC was $0.29 / lb., so maybe that was the ‘Farm Bureau’ price. Somehow I doubt that was the price at Whole Foods. My better half bought a turkey the day before Thanksgiving for around that amount per pound, which was a heavily discounted sale price. Normally you see that price the day after, but maybe they hadn’t sold as briskly ahead of time as the store expected. She also just paid $5.00 for a dozen of the cheap eggs. Organic/cage free were quite a bit more. I showed those stats to my MIL who cooked dinner yesterday. Her dinner for 20 was well over the $116.00 the Farm Bureau estimates. Ian Welsh is clear and to the point. I have nothing else to add except that he’s spot on. The resistance will be picked apart one by one. Not so sure about that. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis have just had their a**** handed to them by Hezbollah. Remember, Hezbollah has their base in the Lebanese people and if they had let the massacres by the Israelis to continue, would have led to the loss of support of their base which is why the – temporary – truce. Hezbollah has used a fair number of their rockets up but they made to make sure that the really good stuff was kept stored. As it is, the north of Israel remains unstable and people are afraid to move back there which will roil Israeli politics. And five IDF divisions and more have been badly mauled by Hezbollah with thousands of Israeli casualties. If this is an Israeli victory, then it is a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis The current events indicate that the Syrians are just having their a**** handed back to them by an international force of jihadists amply supplied by Turkey and supported with judicious aerial attacks by Israel, and that the Palestinians are slowly but surely being exterminated without reprieve. As for Iran, it definitely does not want to be involved in a full-fledged war. The only ones possibly crazy enough to continue engaging in military operations are the Yemenis — but for how long if nobody else does? Their supplies of missiles and drones are not inexhaustible. Things are therefore not looking good at all for the Near-Eastern enemies of Israel and the USA. Thus, Israel has a not negligible probability to secure a victory — costly, prohibitively so perhaps, pyrrhic even, but a victory nevertheless. The interviewer here (Ali Alizadeh) said that there are reports that there are 10,000 Turks fighting for Israel in Gaza. The u of houston professor Fadi Kafeety did not comment on that specifically. How Yemen Became a Rising Power in West Asia? A Conversation with Fadi Kafeety https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeIR2TIHljU has anyone else heard anything about that? If the ceasefire holds it will be a victory for Israel – That may be true but, anyone, or, group, being successful in genocide and massive human rights violations – that’s not something, in my mind, to be victorious or successful about. Assuredly the dimension of time will prove it short term and disastrous – but hey, why speculate about the future and it’s outcome when the now is the deal. What risks being utterly disastrous in my mind is a world in which genocide becomes normalised and international law is dead. If Israel and the US axis get away with it, that’s what we’ll get. Harris losing was a small victory but this is the main risk for our future as a species. E.U. Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W).

Not a Coastie, but there are various authorities for boarding. See in particular Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Numb in India, part 7: Land of gloop Sam Kriss. Trust me, worth a read. A lovely read and thanks for the reminder of how good a writer Sam Kriss can be. I used to be a regular reader and somehow he fell out of my regular subscriptions (too many good things out there to keep up with). Not many westerner writers travelling in Asia provide genuinely new insights, but he is one of them. I’ve never been to Kerala, I just know of it from the lovely patient Keralan nurses who cared for my parents in years past. It has long been recognised as one of the best run Indian States, although the competition isn’t all that high. Its also a good reminder of the incredible diversity of India – there are plenty of chunks of that country as big as many other countries which are very different in culture and politics from what we usually think of as ‘India’ – the many cultures of the Himalayan foothills and plateaus as one example. There are also a surprising number of hot wars going on at any one time in the sub-continent, usually entirely unreported, even in India. The question of why India seems to have faltered while China surges is one that seems to be consuming both Indians and Chinese these days – my Chinese media feeds are full of mocking commentary on India. Some Indians seem quietly confident their country is at the beginning of a renaissance, others have their exit plans well prepared. I guess it all depends on what you think of Modi. Assuming climate change doesn’t make the sub-continent uninhabitable, its not too late, there are plenty of models in Asia for late take-offs economically – Vietnam and Indonesia in particular seem to have hit that acceleration stage and both had similar problems to India. India has its success stories. It has some of the biggest companies in the world, a vast amount of domestic talent, nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, and satellites. As well as…. all the other things we know about. But sometime around the mid 1990’s it started to fall very far behind its most obvious peer nation, in terms of raw GNP, human development and in tech. Many a book and article has been written on the topic, you can pretty much pick your theory as to why India has fallen behind according to your particular prejudice. Too much capitalism, too little capitalism, too big a state, too weak a state, colonialism, the wrong type of colonialism, cultural diversity, lack of it, the caste system, paternalistic family companies, laziness (the latter often opined by upper caste Indians), and so on. I’m something of an geographic determinist. Big continental or island States that succeed economically tend to have certain things in common – big navigable rivers or inland seas connecting natural harbours, easy to access mineral riches, good soils. India lacks many of these – it has few natural harbours, its rivers are not suitable for much transport and with some localised exceptions its soils are generally poor and unproductive without intensive labour inputs. It has plenty of coal and other minerals, but it is generally low quality and difficult to access and refine. The difficult topography of inland India always seemed to lead to lots of little feudal states historically, which proved easy for outside conquerors, with plenty of those from north of the Himalaya preceding the British. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things The God of Small Things, a Booker award winner takes place in Kerala. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_We_Imagine_as_Light All We Imagine as Light, a Cannes award winner, follows to Kerala nurses trying to make it in Mumbai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_India Kerala is the only surviving communist state in India.

There is no single tragedy at the heart of Arundhati Roy’s devastating first novel. Although ”The God of Small Things” opens with memories of a family grieving around a drowned child’s coffin, there are plenty of other intimate horrors still to come, and they compete for the reader’s sympathy with the furious energy of cats in a sack. Yet the quality of Ms. Roy’s narration is so extraordinary — at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple — that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish. This ambitious meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family is part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, and it begins at its chronological end, in a landscape of extravagant ruin. When 31-year-old Rahel Kochamma returns to Ayemenem House, her former home in the south Indian state of Kerala, its elegant windows are coated with filth and its brass doorknobs dulled with grease; dead insects lie in the bottom of its empty vases. The only animated presence in the house seems to be great-aunt Baby Kochamma’s new television set — in front of which she and her servant sit day after day, munching peanuts. Rahel has come back to Ayemenem not to see her great-aunt, however, but because she has heard that her twin brother, Estha, has unexpectedly returned. Estha and Rahel were once inseparable, but now they have been apart for almost 25 years — ever since the winter of 1969, when their English cousin, Sophie Mol, drowned in the river with their grandmother’s silver thimble in her fist. ”Perhaps it’s true that things can change in a day,” Ms. Roy’s narrator muses. ”That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house — the charred clock, the singed photograph, the scorched furniture — must be resurrected from the ruins and examined. Preserved. Accounted for.” And this is precisely Ms. Roy’s undertaking as, throughout her book, she shuttles between the twins’ past and present, continually angling in, crabwise, toward the night of Sophie Mol’s death…. https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/books/melodrama-as-structure-for-subtlety.html June 3, 1997 Melodrama as Structure for Subtlety By MICHIKO KAKUTANI THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS By Arundhati Roy ”The God of Small Things,” Arundhati Roy’s dazzling first novel, begins as a sort of mystery story. What caused the boy named Estha to stop talking? What sent his twin sister, Rahel, into exile in the United States? Why did their beautiful mother, Ammu, end up dying alone in a grimy hotel room? What killed their English cousin, Sophie Mol? And why has a ”whiff of scandal” involving sex and death come to surround their bourgeois family? While such questions may sound crudely melodramatic, they provide the narrative architecture of a novel that turns out to be as subtle as it is powerful, a novel that is Faulknerian in its ambitious tackling of family and race and class, Dickensian in its sharp-eyed observation of society and character… A millennia-long tradition of organized martial arts may have helped them retain their cultural and economic identity. Kalaripayattu. Kerala is the most lovely part of India imho. I’ve been going to India on holiday almost every year for 20 years or so, because I love it so much. Last year I decided to fly up to Ahmedabad on my way home to spend a few days. I can’t really recommend it. Only place I’ve been where the Hindutva vibe was too much to take. Good thali though and the Gandhi ashram was worth the hour it took to visit. But Kerala is fab. The ayurvedic treatment you can get there is very reasonably priced and they are not dogmatic or trying to convert you to some new lifestyle but rather help you to get better. Kochi is a lovely little city and Thiruvanathpuram (Trivandrum) is a sort of quirky state capital with a giant wooden maharajah’s palace next to a huge temple and very walkable. But the best part is just to get out to the backwaters and eat a Keralan fish curry, washed down with coconut toddy… My mind makes an association between Sam Kriss’ gloop and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop. You’re welcome. Re: ‘organ damage’ As a cardiologist with Long Covid and a fan of this blog permit me to say that it’s impossible to know what to make of the “mild atrial irregularity” without knowing the age of the patient or the nature of the “irregularity”. Millions of people had mild atrial issues long before COVID — and it correlates with age and various other items like hypertension, alcohol consumption patterns, etc. Atrial arrhythmia is one of the most overdiagnosed and overtreated cardiac ‘conditions’, and a source of much business for the electrophysiology labs that have sprouted up all over the country in the last 20 years. That said, since so much of the phenotype of Long Covid runs parallel with aging in general, it wouldn’t surprise me if an increase in atrial issues were one of the post-acute things we see. Still, I wouldn’t put it high on the list of things those of us with Long Covid need to fret about. (alas) Vikas, I very much appreciate the analysis and always will, but what I hope for most is that you be well. As for me, jogging or walking daily, whether I want to or not, * seems to keep me fit. * I never want to, but almost never miss. Thank you, I prefer to think of my heart rate as having a certain jazziness to it. A bit of syncopation makes dancing easier. Evidence for Biological Age Acceleration and Telomere Shortening in COVID-19 Survivors I’m remembering from early in the pandemic the idea that getting covid aged you ten years was a topic of discussion here. Good times. Yes, same-same with clotting. And the spike. This site is prophylactic against morbidity. Interesting was recently diagnosed with atrial arrhythmia and have an electrophysiology consult in a couple of weeks. Never had Covid (that I know of) and not vaxed. So just another random data point signifying nothing. “Hope lies with Ursula” One would think, or hope, that as a former defense minister, EC President von der Leyen would demonstrate a significant grasp of what’s happening in Ukraine and what’s at stake as the war escalates. Is there any evidence for that belief? “Xi sits in Beijing. In Moscow, Putin. In Washington, Trump is on the way. You can call them crazy guys. They don’t want good.

Ultimate Irony Comes as Taliban Asks Russia’s Help To Evade US Sanctions, Closing 50-year Loop of Violence Antiwar.com (Kevin W) The US had spent billions arming freedom fighters to fight the Russians out of Afghanistan, … No it didn’t. US had intentionaly spent gazillions arming extremists of all sorts all around the world, knowing very well what they are, and rebranding them as freedom fighters in order to sell the lie to idi*ts. If the Russians manage to bring Afghanistan in from the cold like they are doing for North Korea, then maybe that country can develop all those mineral reserves that the Pentagon tried to use to justify the occupation and rebuild their country. Just don’t forget the real reason why the occupation- https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1547752702511263745 I once read an interview of a warlord from the Northern Alliance which I hope I had bookmarked, but no such luck, so I have no proof. But in that interview the man clearly declared that had they (mujahideen) known what would follow for Afghanistan, they certainly would have not fought “the shuravi”. I guess Taliban learned from all those mistakes. Andrew Korybko has an interesting take on Russia’s strategy re Afghanistan. The Kremlin is playing the long game, as usual. https://asiatimes.com/2024/11/russias-grand-geo-economic-plan-a-step-closer-in-afghanistan/ “Russian Ruble Collapses As Putin’s Economy in Trouble” I think that Newsweek are getting their hopes up. I don’t think that the sanctions are causing the inflation in Russia so much as the Russian economy is overheating due to it’s expansion as a wartime economy. A shortage of workers is not helping things either. Inside Russia the ruble is not a problem as that is what the workers are getting paid in so if Newsweek is hoping, like Biden, that the ruble will become rubble they may have to wait a while. Just wait until these Russian collapse stories meet the China collapse stories and have babies together. Maybe with some “at what cost” polycule added in. The data other than an artificial currency value are fine. While what matters is currency support from China, which is there along with general economic support. China is by far the largest world economy and open and inviting to Russian exchange. Russians as a number of other peoples can come and go in China with no visas and Hainan could not be a better winter refuge; even a free port refuge. Russia has made China more than energy self-sufficient, and the Russian and Chinese economies are complementary in important ways beyond energy. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/October/weo-report?c=223,924,132,134,532,534,536,158,546,922,112,111,&s=PPPGDP,PPPSH,&sy=2000&ey=2023&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Gross Domestic Product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) for Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States, 2000-2023 2023 China ( 33,552) United States ( 27,721) India ( 14,620) Russia ( 6,512) Japan ( 6,398) Germany ( 5,876) Brazil ( 4,457) Indonesia ( 4,335) France ( 4,211) United Kingdom ( 4,137) With a weak Ruble, Russian gas exports will be even cheaper in comparison to what the suckers EU will pay for strong-dollar US LNG. The ruble-Euro exchange rate on 23.02.2022 was 90.88, today it is 114.31; this is not a particularly significant change after nearly three years, especially in light of all the fireworks that have taken place. RWA’s summary is interesting. I would add one more thing, based on my 20+ years of experience importing into Russia. Every year without fail, as the new year approached, the ruble would depreciate vs the $ and Euro. Always. This drove our accountants crazy, as it made it more expensive for us to buy $/Euro (usually Euro) to pay our EU suppliers before the end of the year, and because we were pricing in Euro (though selling in rubles) it also drove up our ruble profits (i.e., more income taxes to pay). And every year, after the holidays ended after 15 January, the ruble would appreciate (usually back to its previous level). Then as now, two factors were at play: higher seasonal demand for $/Euro (Russians preparing to vacation abroad, retailers buying imported products for the holiday shopping season, trading companies settling their foreign accounts payable before the close of the year), and the Russian government gently leaning on the scales to weaken the ruble (in order to boost corporate income tax revenues across the board, a nice holiday gift for the upcoming year’s budget). I think there is nothing new under the sun. Let’s see what the exchange rates look like at the end of January 2025 before jumping to conclusions. Since January 2000, the real exchange value of Russian currency has increased by 55.7%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mvBn January 15, 2018 Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Russia, 2000-2024 (Indexed to 2000) I don’t see why Russians should be too concerned about currency fluctuations. Free floating currencies bounce all over the place for a variety of reasons. Over the last 25 years the Canadian dollar has swung from 68 cents US to 1.10 $ US and back down again. It doesn’t make much difference at the retail level for consumers but has caused serious problems for exporters when the CAD was high. Many factories have closed as a result. I should add Canada is a net energy exporter, as is Russia. For a net importer a low currency could cause serious problems.

That’s a danger, baby, bathwater. But here’s a start: : Left/Right is historically accurate, since the Left was where the Third Estate sat during the National Assembly, and it was dominated by lawyers, not workers. What was, now is. : Taleb: Never use terms such as progressive or conservative without reference to a rate of change Progressive and conservative are ill defined terms, verbalistic labels. It is required to specify a rate of change for every specific domain. Rationally progressive means embracing progress by accepting a certain rate of change deemed optimal. Too high a rate of change cancels the gains from previous mutations; while too slow a change leads to misfitness. : Pandit, Pradhan, & van Schaik: Figure 6 shows the number of feasible classes as a function of the skew in power, σ, and the original group size, N(0). … the number of feasible classes has a very weak dependence on group size. Thus, for the N(0) in the typical range of human group sizes, the number of classes only depends on σ. Intriguingly, at lower σ we expect to find more classes… The size of the upper class is largest for σ → 0 (~ half of the group), thus potentially leading to a large number of middle classes. Power. That’s a word Fazi doesn’t hone in on. Rather applicable to the tremendous wealth inequality of an oligarchy. Thanks.

Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? From the article” “But U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that the cables were not cut deliberately” It not something I’m up to date on, but international law on undersea cables is mostly based on the Paris Convention of 1888 (yes, thats right, 1888). In simple terms, there is an obligation on ships not do do anything that could break a cable, and its up to national governments to enforce the law on vessels registered in its country. Military ships do have the right under Article X to board a ship suspected of having broken a cable so even if the breaking was accidental, stopping and checking the Chinese ship would be lawful under the law of the sea. This Atlantic Council (booo!) article says otherwise-stating your aforementioned treaty doesn’t provide guarantees and protections for undersea cables. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/hybrid-warfare-project/international-law-doesnt-adequately-protect-undersea-cables-that-must-change/ They are not really contradictory. The right to check a vessel under any flag that is suspected of causing damage is established in Article X, but its always been ambiguous about what rights and obligations apply after the stop occurs, especially if a State actor is suspected to be involved in the damage or the ‘home’ country of the vessel involved refuses to co-operate. There has also been questions raised about other types of cable, specifically transnational electric cables, as they are not explicitly covered by the convention. High profile stops are rare, but on a more local scale in seas like the Irish Sea or Dogger Bank, stop and checks in international waters by military vessels of fishing boats suspected of dredging too near to cables happens all the time (fishermen regularly complain about this) – it doesn’t matter where the fishing boat is registered, its a well established right. It just gets ambiguous when you are dealing with contested areas as in the South China Sea or if the suspect is a military vessel -, that’s what the article is about. Re: British Parliament votes on euthanasia: I immediately thought “well they’ve mined “1984” for all it’s worth and are turning to a US novel, “Make Room Make Room”upon which the movie “Soylent Green” was based. On checking novel’s origin , some stats in storyline: Set in mid 1999-New Years day 2000, World population ~7B (seemingly indicative of extreme overpopulation!) and NYC 34M. Food shortage driven by resource hoarding by rich is a major factor in social upheaval . Euthanasia becomes a protein source… Never gonna Happen! Any thoughts on the idea of a western sourced false flag operation in an allied state? The London camera thing is weird but no where near convincing. And would London even be the best target? Is there a euro state where the people aren’t fully on board with project Ukraine and a massive event would act to pull the West together? Perhaps blowing up the Hague would accomplish multiple things at the same time? First, because of the UK’s role in NATO’s war on Russia, London will be one of Russia’s three most obvious targets, two of which are in the UK, amongst all the possible targets throughout the Collective West; second, the British security services are best placed and most motivated to organise a false flag; third, the UK’s Parliament and population are incredibly gullible (note the ease with which the ridiculous explanation of the Skripal affair has been accepted); and fourth, it was planned before the Oresnik strike when the various intelligence services still thought that the public would accept that Russia would use a nuke. The problem the West has now is that Russia could take out ALL the decision-making centres (and population centres) in Europe without nukes and the only possible source of effective (that is, nuclear) retaliation would be the US, and that would be disastrous for the US, so the US would consider Article 5, as it is obliged to do, and say “No thanks, old buddies. The war against Russia is now strictly a European affair”. There was a pamphlet about the decline of the UK published by Encounter magazine, a CIA front, in the fifties entitled, as I remember, “Suicide of a Nation” (God knows where it is among my shelves). The title was, of course, metaphorical. The question now is whether the Brits are prepared to play a game of Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. Unfortunately, the answer will most likely be that the ideologically driven incompetents who’ve been running this war beyond the reach of sanity will say, “Yes, please. I’ll go first, so pass me the gun”. I have to admit that I did not understand how virulently various interests in the UK hated the Russians. I’ve been amazed to watch my UK friends post meme after meme describing how awful the Russians are and how we should just annihilate them all. It makes me think that western leaders will only be happy when Gaza is full of ghosts and Russia is a graveyard. I seem to have missed some crucial Britishness classes because I have never felt this way. And I really don’t see where my compatriots have got this from. However, I did have a New Year’s party in Dec 2022 which nearly ruined a thirty year friendship group when it turned out that two of us (me + gold trader) took Russia’s side and two of us (particle physics professor and healthcare informatics / pandemic data analysis PhD) took the Ukraine’s. We were shocked by their fact-free convictions. We have agreed not to speak of it again! Actually, if you do a YT search about the CCD cameras in London; you’ll find many videos stating that they have been off-line for the past 85 days or more, not just 24 hours. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but then again, what reporter nowadays would dare to ask the question? I say, “off-line” because the theory is that they’re still working, just no longer accessible to the public (nor to the regular police either, for some reason). Commenters on these videos have stated that a similar thing has happened in Manchester, and I believe Bristol. Apparently, MI-5/6 has form on this because the CCD cameras around London were supposedly not operating on the day of 7/7 either. I’m just repeating what the YTubers have been saying on this last bit, but they’re all pretty insistent on this. Who knows what the truth is anymore? For anyone who wants to have some real fun; do a YT search about those drones that have been showing up at UK airports. The false flag theory is plausible but if the goal is all-out war with Russia, western war planners once again fail to take everything into account. I, an average guy living an average life, know for near certain that a co-ordinated allied attack on Russia would be met with a similar mobilisation from China. It’s just obvious that China’s best interests are Russia not falling into western hands and getting used in turn to isolate China. This looks like it’s going to be a case of dog catching car. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/europe/uk-assisted-dying-bill-vote.html November 29, 2024 After Emotional Debate, British Lawmakers Vote to Legalize Assisted Dying In a landmark decision on Friday, Parliament voted in favor of allowing assisted suicide for some terminally ill people under strict conditions. By Stephen Castle [ Seemingly explaining why Labour has shown no legislative interest in strengthening the public health service. No wonder why Jeremy Corbyn had to be expelled from Labour. ] It seems that rational people with increasingly painful, progressive and handicapping chronic illnesses which are not in themselves terminal will still be forced to commit suicide without the support of friends or family. Seems that Parliament is addicted to short measure The British legislation may be a first step. In Canada where we have had Medically Assistance in Dying (MAID) for a number of years there have been a variety of steps allowing people suffering greatly with no hope of recovery the relief of MAID. About 7500 people avail themselves of this merciful way of leaving their suffering behind, able to leave this world in the company of loved ones. I’m 72 and fully support the legislation. The British people overwhelmingly support the legislation as shown by a poll published in The Independent yesterday. The support is greatest among those over 55. re: Oreshnik orbital weapon as explained by the villain in “G.I.

A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History – Zeynep Tufekci And it is not paywalled, either, which is extremely rare at NY Times. Rest assured, after H5N1 hits, she’ll be minimizing yet another Pandemic, if it turns out people don’t turn blue and explode. None the less, clearly some subset of the elite are rightly freaking out. Just a few weeks ago, a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu. It seems to have gotten it from sick poultry on the same farm. Pigs cause extra worry because they are considered to be ideal mixing vessels for various animal flu viruses to adapt and spread among humans. Last week, the virus was found in a flock of ducks at a pet fair in Hawaii, the one state that hadn’t previously found a case — likely transmitted by wild birds, which continue to spread the illness far and wide. Of the 34 individuals who had been exposed at that pet fair, including 13 who had respiratory symptoms, all were offered voluntary testing. Five declined. A teenager in Canada was infected, and the virus showed some key mutations that bring it closer to adapting to spread among humans. This outbreak has so far been mostly mild in humans, but historically it has been deadly, and further mutations could make it so again. That Canadian is in critical condition, unable to breathe independently. There’s also an infected child in California who was not known to have come into contact with any sick animals at all, which raises the terrifying possibility that he got it from another human being. And the virus levels in the wastewater in several states keep spiking. We’ve definitely arrived at the bucket-up phase of this. One thing I keep in mind about the “Collective Biden” is that the husk alone has had Covid 3 times, Dr Jill has had it several times and Blinken, Sullivan and the rest have had it several times as well. This may have something to do with why the USA is now in a shooting War with Russia and it does not bode well for the future. Maybe we’ll get lucky… This was also reported by TASS but no sign in mainstream media in the states… https://news-pravda.com/world/2024/11/28/886216.html “Up to 40 specialists from the USA were destroyed”: The Ministry of Defense revealed details of the retaliatory strike against Ukraine The Ministry of Defense told what losses the Ukrainian side suffered after Russia’s retaliatory strike against attacks with long-range ATACMS missiles. According to the ministry, on November 28, the Russian Armed Forces launched a comprehensive attack on defense and industrial facilities, as well as the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. In addition, on November 25 and 26, Iskander ballistic missiles destroyed ATACMS launchers, installations with experimental samples of Grom-2 missiles, as well as a transport and loading vehicle of the Neptune anti-ship complex. In addition, during the attack, Russian missiles landed directly at the headquarters of the Main Intelligence Directorate “Kraken” in Kharkov. As a result of the strike, up to 40 foreign specialists were eliminated, most of whom were specialists from the United States. From A strange new climate era is beginning to take hold It will be those investments — and the energy choices of up-and-coming developing nations — that will determine the future of the planet. So WaPo basically blames developing nations, Trump tariffs, AI, whatever, the blame directed everywhere except at the capitalist class itself. No, the solution to climate is to terminate capitalism. Instead we’re all gonna burn alive. Without a serious discussion of what all of this energy usage is in service of, and what people really need to live a decent life, there won’t be any worthwhile progress on avoiding an extinction level event. Good stuff. As much as I like the the idea of Putin as Cobra Commander holding the West hostage, it makes about as much sense as the more hyperbolic claims about the Oreshnik. We already have decades of research and experimental data on fairly similar cases: 1) On the low end, large sabot penetrators (tungsten or depleted uranium): 10kg at Mach 5-6 2) On the high end, HEAT warhead penetrators (copper): 1kg at Mach 15-25 Neither of these cause destruction by mystical waves of pressure or heat. The damage is purely kinetic: direct impact and spalled fragments of whatever they hit. A 100kg* penetrator travelling at Mach 10 will cause proportionately scaled damage–but it is not remotely comparable to a nuclear weapon. At least, that seems like the safest assumption unless we see dramatic evidence to the contrary. * The throw weight of a Bulava at max range is 1,000 kg bus and warheads, but let’s be generous and assume something with more weight and less range. (This was meant as a reply to AG’s GI Joe clip, but it looks like I missed it). Since you mention COBRA – your post could either be about Covid OR Oreshnik. p.s. Did Putin not state that several Oreshniks could cause as much destruction as a tactical nuke? If so I don´t know what value of a nuke´s powers he was referring to. Fission is a different beast altogether. But with conventional destructive capabalities added? Yes, that’s right. Let’s do some rough math (hopefully correctly) and see where this might be coming from: A small nuke = a kiloton of TNT = 4.2E12 joules A 100kg* penetrator traveling at Mach 10 = 5.9E8 36 penetrators in an Oreshnik = 2.1E10 100 Oreshniks (or just 10 Oreshniks if it is a big missile) = 2.1E12 It seems that Putin is doing a sleight of hand that several others have done to impress the folks at home. You add up the joules of energy from a vast number of penetrators with such and such weight and velocity and eventually you get an impressive number. But it doesn’t add up to quite as much practical destructive force as the number implies. And even then, Putin must have been using numbers from a small tactical nuke. * 100kg is just a guess. If the missile is small, they couldn’t be much heavier, but a big short ranged missile could carry 10x more weight. What do you want to destroy? Counter force or counter value? Critical issue is accuracy of penetrators. If you have 18 hard targets (assign 2 “penetrators” to each) spread around the area of Hiroshima, you can achieve results equal to a 20 kt bombs. Would as air burst have gotten deep vaults? Jeffrey Lewis on TWITTER tried to ridicule the Oreshnik a bit by describing that buildings that were not targeted but were next to where the factotry was located had suffered cracks. Thus it was a bad weapon and the claims of accuracy fraudulent. I don´t understand these people. Why do scientists have to act like propagandists. It reminds of the German nuclear phyisicists when they were interned in Farm Hall in 1945 and were mocking US and others as not able to pull off a nuke before August 6th shell-shocked them… Kinetic penetrators were never about sheer energy, but about focusing it in a small area. They can get much deeper than surface explosion can. Comparing just energies of different projectile types is like comparing just GDPs of countries. Here’s a math problem. How big would a surface detonation have to be, in order to destroy underground bunker that one Oreshnik kinetic penetrator can? re: Project Zeus Did Zeus eat hazelnuts? I don´t think so. They are not your typical Greek flora, or are they? Most of the calculations I’ve seen compare the energy delivered by the mach 10 mass to that of kilotons of TNT, like nukes. Putin claimed that the temperature of the mass was 4000° which is above the melting point of most metals, and the plasma envelope around it was evident. That added thermal energy, and the dynamics of a plasma shielded molten blob might lead to some interesting effects not obvious from more mundane experiments. I agree with you that this is more than it seems. It is only a closed system in a vacuum. Passing through the atmosphere the air resistance creates the friction that generates this heat. That is likely adding to the net effect of the explosion but not figured into the equation. Metallurgists know about the molecular changes that take place above critical temperatures making some stainless steels magnetic and some non-magnetic. When tool steels (normally cubic-centered structures) reach critical temperatures they become austenitic (face-centered cubic grain structure) and lose their magnetism. Unknown changes are probably generated by this heat to the unknown substance of these rods, but it has been tested in Russia. Deferring to people who have practical experience in this is not magical thinking but pragmatic. I have seen several suggestions that the process at the end is magnetohydrodynamics, no official word yet. The scientist in charge is saying that currently they operate at 2,200deg. centigrade but theory lets them hope to get it up to 3,000 deg centigrade. i.e. Mach 15 @ Wisker. About the only realistic assessment I’ve read here. One has only to look at the published pictures of the above ground buildings at Yukhmash to see the sturdy Soviet era buildings have hardly “turned to dust”. Some caught fire from the white hot heat of passing projectiles. Subsequent descriptions of clusters of projectile holes in the ground where they missed a building have turned up. Nobody seems to have dug down to have a look at the “destruction” below. Hardly worth the bother. But, the general belief here is that somehow the projectiles from Oreshnik have kiloton nuclear bomb power. I’ll repeat again for the more dense folks here who seem to believe in magic: The final energy of the rod projectiles cannot exceed that of the chemical energy released by the missile’s rocket motors. Period. It is a closed system and the Law of Conservation of Energy applies. If 40 tonnes of rocket fuel, expended all at once, like in blowing up on the launch pad, is equivalent to several kilotons of TNT, I’m a monkey’s uncle. But if fairy tales make you happy, so be it. And the same goes for Putin. The advantage of Oreshnik is the super fast delivery time of an actual nuke on target from a mobile launcher. Now that indeed is a concern for Western “strategists” who might be awake. If indeed, any competent ones are on the job who are not beholden to the party line like MSM journalists who are unconsciously adept at writing “stuff” that pleases their overlords. And no, I am not making shit up. Others are. I don’t know where people are getting kilotons out of this weapon. I’ve seen, and my own crude calculations produce, multi-ton-level per 75-100kg munition, with that energy focused in a cone along the direction of travel like a large hammer blow. The highest I’ve seen is 11 tons per munition, and I suspect that’s too big, although the Ukrainians estimated velocity at 11.0 to 11.4 km/s, a lot higher than other reports, and energy is velocity squared. Assuming no more than 10 tons tnt equivalent/munition, that’s less than 360 tons tnt per device. That’s still a lot. What’s even more interesting is how tight the sheaf of the impact appears to be. If that’s the case, this weapon is incredibly precise (if not accurate) especially for its velocity. Whatever is below the impact points is going to be crushed. Explosives used in that tight of a sheaf impacting within a second of each other might cause less damage due to interference, whether that be due to phase cancellation or blowing up the following warheads or other factors. This is an interesting weapon system for sure, but probably not even close to kiloton yield even in aggregate. That’s still enough to utterly destroy something on the receiving end, and do so efficiently. Your point is valid and I am sceptical of these claims but should we also consider something like “energy flux”, i.e. the impact is vertical and focused in a narrow cone around the falling projectile, rather than a spherical explosion, increasing the damage in a directional way? If it is focused in a cone with 1/10th the radius of a spherical explosion, the “flux” is ~ 100x greater (I am modelling it as a passing through a flat circle rather than a small spherical surface). Michael von der Schulenburg with acid comment on EU in BERLINER ZEITUNG: Ukraine War: New EU Resolution Brings Europe to the Brink of World War III https://archive.is/wwzU3 Finale: This resolution is a document full of hatred, panic and hysteria – a shameful expression of irresponsibility and a lack of empathy for the many victims of such war hysteria. There is nothing in it for us Europeans to be proud of. Fortunately, this resolution is unlikely to have any direct political impact on the war in Ukraine. The European Parliament has simply demonstrated once again that it behaves like a “dummy decision-maker” on many issues – in this case, fortunately for all of us. For me, who has always been an ardent supporter of the European idea, it is painful to listen to the debates of a war-mongering and hate-filled parliamentary majority. I then ask myself: what kind of monster have we created with the EU? I believe this is the full text of the resolution: JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on reinforcing EU’s unwavering support to Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression and the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia This is just an embarrassing display of political, economic and social delusion and, as mi mam used to say, “Fine words don’t butter no parsnips”. But stupidity can elicit a tree full of hazelnuts. Good multi language pun! It is a monster which will either remain subservient to the US, or will gradually implode and it’s members will part company with each other, or both; or it could simply recognise reality and either implode or remains in some form as abstract in it’s realty as it’s model, the Holy Roman Empire, accepting that it is the inferior in terms of it’s relationships with Russia and China – on whom it is dependent if it’s inhabitants are to enjoy a standard of living anywhere approaching the standard they enjoy today which, of course, for most people means a standard lower than that of 2021. Just started reading that wonderful post about Kerala. A thing about it that kind of lights me up a bit, and I think may not be mentioned in the piece itself, is it’s proximity to the upcoming north/south transport corridor that will bypass Suez and go all the way to Russia, IIRC. The port of Chabahar in Iran is where it will start. This looks set to be an interesting corner of the world as the near future unfolds. I’m looking forward to watching how things develop.

Title: Amazon employees are ‘rage-applying’ as its return-to-office mandate looms—experts say that’s exactly what CEO Andy Jassy wants

Amazon’s return-to-office policy announced in September, mandating employees work in person five days a week starting in 2025, has workers irritated. Some have even begun “rage-applying” to new positions, wanting to stick it to the tech company. The trouble for them: that could be exactly the response Amazon was hoping for. The tech mammoth’s strict RTO push might just be a sneaky means of laying off workers, some future-of-work experts say. Amazon likely already knows the new policy will nudge dissatisfied workers out, meaning the company will no longer have to go through the tough process of formal layoffs. As a tradeoff, the RTO crusade could come at the expense of the company’s own talent and tech advancements. “Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,” Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told Business Insider. The company may be content with making the sacrifice of some brain drain. The RTO crackdown came in tandem with CEO Andy Jassy calling for a reduction in managers and a bump in the ratio of workers to managers by 15% by the end of 2025’s first quarter. Amazon said its RTO shift is an effort to strengthen company culture and that the company has no plans to reduce its headcount. Brian Elliott, future-of-work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives, agreed with Bloom. He told Fortune Amazon will “undoubtedly” see employee attrition as a result of the mandate because it continues to be widely unpopular among most U.S. workers. “The vast majority of people want something that is in the middle: They want a couple days a week together that are meaningful with their teams,” he said. “And, by the way, those people the flexibility is taken away from are much more likely to jump ship.” A study from human resources consulting firm Robert Half conducted last month revealed 39% of office workers in Australia would quit if their company slashed flexible working. Amazon employees are already bolstering that statistic. Anonymous job review site Blind, which surveyed 2,585 verified Amazon workers a day after Jassy’s RTO announcement, found that 73% of employees considered quitting their jobs as a result of the mandate. These “backdoor layoffs,” as Bloom refers to them, have already made a splash in other workplaces. According to research by BambooHR published in May surveying over 1,500 U.S. managers, about a quarter of executives said they hoped employees would voluntarily leave the company after the implementation of an RTO mandate. When AT&T mandated its 60,000 workers across nine of its 350 offices work in person again, some employees interpreted the push as a way to eliminate workers unable or uninterested in relocating to their offices. CEO John Stankey estimated that 15% of the affected workforce, about 9,000 employees, would face the choice of relocating or leaving the company altogether. “It’s a layoff wolf in return-to-office sheep’s clothing,” an anonymous AT&T employee told Bloomberg. The sneaky layoff strategy hasn’t always worked out for employers. Almost half of employers that implemented RTO policies saw a greater than anticipated level of employee attrition, according to a 2023 report from Unispace. Almost 30% reported recruitment difficulties. Amazon will face this same risk, Elliott argued. Other tech companies may keep their flexible work policies as a means to poach Amazon’s talent, and Amazon may struggle to hire new faces, he said. This talent pool shrinks even more for women, who may need flexibility for child care, and managers, who can leverage experience to find a cushier job elsewhere. “You lose a set of people in your organization,” Elliott said. “You lose high performance.” A version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on October 2, 2024. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Intel said on Wednesday its deal for $7.86 billion in U.S. government subsidies restricts the company's ability to sell stakes in its chipmaking unit if it becomes an independent entity. The U.S. Commerce Department announced the subsidy to Intel on Tuesday, part of $39 billion for the sector including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and others in an effort to revitalize chip manufacturing in the United States.

Title: The best Apple Black Friday deals you’re hunting for are all right here!

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (today – November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). There is no longer any need to wait, and we’re seeing some fantastic deals! We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Black Friday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: For more monitors for your Mac look at Best Mac monitor deals for Black Friday U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry There are Black Friday deals on many of the streamers, for example, Hulu is bundling Disney+ for a saving of 85% (just $2.99 a month). Peacock has 75% off at $1.99 month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is pay $8 a month, 50% off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-days trial, or its 3-months if you buy an Apple product. There are even some Black Friday deals: As for Apple’s set-top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it. See our round-up of the Best Apple TV deals. U.S. U.K. In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on the any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad! Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29 in 2024) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks. You can get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Here’s how it compares to last year and the year before. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals: Check out these time-limited tech deals before they go.

"The U.S market will continue to do well. As you know, tech has already done well. So, what I would do is focus on companies and industries that are taking advantage of technology to improve productivity," the chairman of the Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund said in an interview with CNBC last week. U.S.-based companies geared toward China and India, as well as other major emerging market economies, are well positioned, he added. "I focus on those companies that are global in their scope, and producing and exporting and selling in these countries, because that's where the growth will be." Investors should also consider firms taking advantage of what Mobius calls "accelerated information," such as chip manufacturers. "I call AI accelerated information because there's nothing artificial about AI and it's not intelligent. But it's getting more information faster and being able to analyze that information much more effectively," he said. His comments come as emerging markets that produce semiconductors enjoy an economic boom, with Taiwan — which makes most of the advanced chips in circulation — a particular success story. ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia are also enjoying increased foreign investment. Malaysia's focus on chip production, for instance, has seen it become deeply embedded into the global supply chain. Speaking with CNBC at the October IMF annual meetings in Washington, D.C., Malaysia's central bank governor Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour said the country exports 7% of the world's semiconductors. Mobius says there's "no question" that a tech bubble is on the horizon given the valuations of the so-called Magnificent Seven — a group of Big Tech stocks comprising of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. But although he admitted that some of stock prices had "gone up too fast and too far," he's not concerned. "You must remember that you can't just look at the price-to-earnings ratio, which is the normal measure that people use to evaluate whether an industry or a stock is too expensive, because the growth rate of these companies is so great," he said. Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, with its next-generation AI chip Blackwell now in focus. Shares of the company have nearly tripled so far in 2024 — up more than 170% in the year-to-date — making it the world's most valuable publicly traded company. Some investors worry the AI juggernaut won't be able to keep up the rapid growth, however, although Mobius remains optimistic about the prospects for Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks. "The [Magnificent Seven] earnings are growing at a terrific pace and you've got to look forward that will continue. I'm not so concerned about most of these companies being too expensive, they will continue to do quite well," Mobius added. "And of course, you have new companies coming into the picture that are also benefiting from these changes." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Andy Farrell hoping Ireland have kept their best performance until last against Australia

Whether the provinces see it this way or not is a moot point, but Ireland are in bonus territory this weekend with the addition of a fourth Autumn Nations Series game against Australia, or at any rate it will be very much a bonus if they keep their best performance until last against Joe Schmidt’s team. That is what Andy Farrell most wants before heading off on his sabbatical with the British & Irish Lions. “Our best performance of the autumn and maybe more, hopefully,” said the Irish head coach after announcing a side which sees the return of Hugo Keenan, James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park, Ronan Kelleher and James Ryan, as well as the retention of Sam Prendergast at outhalf. “That’s what you’re always wishing for, isn’t it, to progress? Australia are certainly progressing. We feel that the occasion, the importance of it, everything that we put on, trying to kick on in any type of series, is enough for us to see the best of ourselves.” Farrell loves maximising landmarks and there’ll be no shortage of them on Saturday at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 3.10pm), what with Cian Healy reaching the Irish record of 134 caps off the bench and this game part of the IRFU’s 150th anniversary celebrations. “It’s huge, it’s a huge privilege for us all. We’ve Ollie Campbell coming in this evening (Thursday) presenting the one-off jerseys we’re going to use. They’re beautiful jerseys, aren’t they? Very nice,” added Farrell dutifully of the retro commemorative jerseys which went on sale this week and will be worn against the Wallabies. Campbell is the perfect fit, not only as a top bloke and great player, but he captained the Belvedere College team that won the Leinster Schools Senior Cup in 1972, while Healy was part of the 2005 Belvedere team which beat Blackrock to bridge a 33-year gap. “It’s a privilege for us because we talk about our history a lot in this type of position when it comes around on our shift. The 150th anniversary is a special place for us, and then you combine it with what’s happening there with Cian. “What a story, playing his debut 15 years ago against Australia,” said Farrell in reference to Healy’s debut in a 20-20 draw against Australia at Croke Park in November 2009. “It’s fitting for both the union and for Cian and his family. So (it is) a privileged-type situation for us all to be involved.” While the return of five frontliners was significant the retention of the 21-year-old Prendergast for a second successive start is the headline selection ahead of Jack Crowley, who has to be content with a return to the bench after starting all nine post-World Cup Tests prior to last week’s win over Fiji. Gus McCarthy has been preferred on the bench to Rob Herring, as is Craig Casey ahead of Conor Murray, while Peter O’Mahony and Garry Ringrose return to complete the ‘23′. While Prendergast’s selection was perhaps a less risky punt in the final game of a November window, Farrell saw this as a decision based on merit in the here and now. “This isn’t just throwing someone in and hoping to get the best out of it. I think he’s deserved it a little bit but also there’s obviously an eye on (the future). I suppose with the two young lads, this game won’t define them. It’ll be a good part of their development, and that’s what you’re hoping for.” Though one suspects both men are probably a tad weary of the narrative and line of questioning, Farrell said he welcomed the storyline of Schmidt returning to these shores for the first time as an opposing head coach. Praising what Schmidt achieved with Leinster and Ireland as “phenomenal”, Farrell added: “He’s the most successful coach in Irish rugby when you look at his time overall in Dublin. We’ve got a lot to thank him about, and I think it’s a nice story that we get to celebrate this game alongside him.” Farrell thanked Schmidt and David Nucifora for first hiring him as defence coach after the 2016 Six Nations and for the “privilege” of working with him. He also admitted that Schmidt’s “DNA was all over” the All Blacks’ World Cup quarter-final win when their assistant coach. “We’ve been here a little bit before, but when he comes back to these shores he should be celebrated for everything that he’s done for Irish rugby.” Farrell also spoke of cementing the foundations left by Schmidt and adding to them. “Whatever is good we keep cultivating that and keep allowing that to grow, and then I suppose you deal with things in a way that’s true to yourself, the direction of the game that you want to play, and the personnel that you’ve got to play it.” Farrell will miss next year’s Six Nations as well as a three-game summer tour to Georgia, Portugal and one more, but has compartmentalised both roles. “The only thing that drives me on is planning for the future of this team and that’s only been at the forefront of my mind, certainly over the last six months anyway.” Regardless of the result against Australia, Ireland will still be seeking to become the first country to win three Six Nations’ titles in a row next year, and Farrell understandably believes that passing the baton to Simon Easterby will ensure the smoothest transition. “We’ve been working together long enough now to agree on how this team needs to be driven forward. All our ideas over the years, that will continue. Simon is unbelievably diligent and the right man for the role in leading from the front. We’ve had the experience there and we’ve seen the credentials there, and we know it’s going to be a seamless one.” Ireland: Hugo Keenan; Mack Hansen, Robbie Henshaw, Bundee Aki, James Lowe; Sam Prendergast, Jamison Gibson-Park; Andrew Porter, Rónan Kelleher, Finlay Bealham, Joe McCarthy, James Ryan, Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Caelan Doris. Replacements: Gus McCarthy, Cian Healy, Tom O’Toole, Iain Henderson, Peter O’Mahony, Craig Casey, Jack Crowley, Garry Ringrose. Australia: T Wright, A Kellaway, J Suaalii, L Ikitau, M Jorgensen; N Lolesio, J Gordon; J Slipper, B Paenga-Amosa, T Tupou; N Frost, J Williams; R Valetini, F McReight, H Wilson (capt).

The Sensex and Nifty showed modest gains, with investors closely monitoring multiple economic signals and institutional movements. The Sensex opened marginally lower at 79,032.99 from its previous close of 79,043.74 but has moved up, trading at 79,402.52 as of 9.52 AM, gaining 358.78 points or 0.45 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty opened slightly higher at 23,927.15 compared to its previous close of 23,914.15 and is currently at 24,034.20, rising by 120.05 points or 0.50 per cent. The National Stock Exchange introduced F&O contracts for 45 new stocks across diverse sectors, including finance, technology, and renewable energy. Notable additions include Indian Bank, Union Bank, LIC, Cyient, KPIT Technologies, Adani Green Energy, DMart, and Zomato. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) displayed significant selling pressure, offloading equities worth ₹11,756 crore on November 28, contrasting with Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) who were net buyers, purchasing equities worth ₹8,718 crore. “A perplexing market action in recent days is the inexplicable volatility in FII activity,” said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “A few days of buying followed by yesterday’s massive selling is difficult to explain.” Sector-specific movements were prominent. Banking stocks showed potential positive traction due to improved deposit growth, with credit growth slowing to 11.15 per cent year-on-year, while deposit growth slightly exceeded at 11.21 per cent, according to RBI data. The insurance sector attracted attention as the government proposed raising Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) limits from 74 per cent to 100 per cent, potentially opening up new investment opportunities. Top gainers included pharmaceutical stocks, with Sun Pharma (1.77 per cent), Cipla (1.75 per cent), and Dr Reddy’s (1.68 per cent) leading the pack. Mahindra & Mahindra (1.36 per cent) and Adani Ports (1.23 per cent) also showed positive momentum. Conversely, power and utility stocks faced challenges, with Power Grid experiencing a 1.54 per cent decline. Shriram Finance (-0.37 per cent), Coal India (-0.36 per cent), ITC (-0.27 per cent), and Tech Mahindra (-0.16 per cent) were among the top losers. “The market is expected to open on a flat note due to concerns over FII selling and a weak start in Asian markets,” noted Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities. “Asian indices dropped by up to 2 per cent following inflation data from Japan that exceeded expectations.” Technical analysts highlighted critical market levels. “Immediate support is placed at 23,800 and 23,680, which align with strong Fibonacci levels,” explained Mandar Bhojane from Choice Broking. “On the upside, 24,350 serves as immediate resistance.” Global factors continued to influence market sentiment, including ongoing concerns about US inflation, potential tariff threats, and uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate policies. Market participants are advised to remain cautious and monitor sector-specific movements, with particular attention to banking, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. The market’s trajectory remains uncertain, with investors and analysts closely watching upcoming economic indicators and global economic developments.

Title: Bitcoin surpasses 2015-2018 cycle – Is $100K ATH next?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-surpasses-2015-2018-cycle-is-100k-ath-next/

Bitcoin has surpassed the 2015-2018 cycle, sparking more discussion about the potential for $100K. Bitcoin [BTC] has surged past a critical price milestone — surpassing key resistance levels that previously defined its cyclical behavior during the 2015-2018 bull market. This latest breakout highlights the cryptocurrency’s resilience and growing maturity in a market that has evolved significantly since its early speculative days. Unlike the dramatic peaks and valleys of the 2015-2018 cycle, Bitcoin’s current trajectory appears more measured, underpinned by stronger fundamentals and broader adoption. With its price now exceeding levels that many believed would act as insurmountable resistance, questions arise about whether this surge marks the beginning of a new bull cycle — or even a run toward a six-figure valuation. Bitcoin’s current cycle is progressing faster than its 2015-2018 counterpart. After peaking at $20,000 in 2017, Bitcoin took nearly three years to recover, consolidating at lower levels before its next bull run. In contrast, the 2022 bottom has been followed by a much quicker rebound, with Bitcoin surpassing $50,000 within two years — nearly a year faster than the previous recovery. Source: TradingView The chart shows Bitcoin maintaining momentum, with monthly RSI readings above 75 signaling strong bullish conditions. Trading volumes have also exceeded those from the earlier cycle, reflecting increased market participation. This milestone represents an 80% recovery from 2022 lows, supported by long-term holder accumulation and reduced exchange balances. These on-chain shifts highlight stronger fundamentals compared to prior cycles, suggesting less speculative activity and more sustained growth. Bitcoin’s accelerated recovery sets it apart from historical patterns. Two key factors define this cycle: institutional adoption and macroeconomic tailwinds. Major players like BlackRock and Fidelity are pushing for Bitcoin ETFs, signaling mainstream acceptance and driving capital inflows. Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures has surged, reflecting heightened institutional activity. On the macroeconomic front, persistent inflation, geopolitical instability, and de-dollarization trends are bolstering Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge. Additionally, advancements like the Lightning Network have improved scalability, enhancing Bitcoin’s utility. These dynamics, absent in earlier cycles, are fueling stronger and more sustainable demand, positioning Bitcoin as a maturing asset in both retail and institutional markets. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s recent price movement, coupled with strong on-chain fundamentals, makes $100K a real possibility. Bitcoin surged past $90K in November, with a notable increase in trading volume and RSI hitting 75, suggesting robust bullish momentum. The correction that followed has seen Bitcoin hold steady around $95K, maintaining a healthy RSI of 65, indicating that the market is not yet overbought. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 The ongoing institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation concerns and growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs, further support the bullish outlook. With supply constraints post-halving, Bitcoin’s path to $100K remains credible, though broader market volatility could still introduce risks.

Title: The Bambu Lab A1 Mini Changed My Opinion About 3D Printing
URL: https://www.maketecheasier.com/review/bambu-lab-a1-mini/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T01:25:00Z
Full Content:
Sign up for our daily newsletter I’ve watched way too many friends wrestle with 3D printers – endless calibration processes and hours of print settings tweaking just to get a half-decent result. It all seemed like way more trouble than it was worth, and for years, that kept me from even considering buying one myself. But then I discovered the Bambu Lab A1 Mini, and everything changed. When I spotted the Bambu Lab A1 Mini on sale for $200, my interest was immediately piqued by the promise of a plug-and-print experience with high-quality output right out of the box. This hassle-free experience is made possible by a suite of intelligent features that eliminate the typical frustrations of 3D printing. The entire calibration process is fully automated thanks to a network of sensors: it measures the bed level, sets the perfect Z-offset, calibrates the belt tension, and even fine-tunes the vibration compensation before each print. There’s also the Active Flow Rate Compensation system, which actively measures and adjusts the pressure in the nozzle as it prints to eliminate common headaches like blobby corners or inconsistent layers. The compact size was another selling point. At just 347 x 315 x 365 mm, the Bambu Lab A1 Mini has almost exactly the right size for my modest desk setup. Sure, its 180 x 180 x 180 mm build volume isn’t the largest out there, but it’s more than adequate for most of my home printing needs. It’s worth noting that the Bambu Lab also offers an optional A1 Mini-compatible AMS (Automatic Material System) for multi-color printing, but I decided to skip it. As cool as multi-color prints look, the process requires frequent purging of filament when switching colors, which creates a lot of waste. Since my needs for multi-color prints are pretty limited, I couldn’t justify the extra cost and material waste. Convinced that the A1 Mini is worth the price, I placed my order through Bambu Lab’s European store on a Wednesday evening. After a week that felt much longer than usual – thanks to my growing excitement and endless YouTube reviews – a box arrived at my doorstep, and I was ready to unbox my new printer. The A1 Mini came pre-assembled – a welcome departure from the DIY kits I’d watched friends struggle with – and the setup process was refreshingly straightforward. After placing the printer on my desk and removing a few pieces of protective foam, I just needed to attach the spool holder and plug it in. The touchscreen interface walked me through each step with clear instructions that actually made sense. Loading the included sample filament was equally intuitive. The printer guided me through the process on its 2.4-inch touchscreen: insert the filament until the sensor detects it, then tap “Load.” The printer handled everything else automatically, heating up the nozzle and feeding the filament through. When plastic emerged from the nozzle, I knew I was ready to print. Then came the moment of truth: my first Benchy, the little 3D printed tugboat that serves as a standard test print across the 3D printing community. The printer confidently ran through its pre-print calibration routine, checking everything from bed level to belt tension. Then it started printing at a speed that made me nervous – until I saw the results. About 20 minutes later (this includes the time it took the printer to complete its calibration routines), I was holding a nearly perfect Benchy. The layers were clean, the overhangs were smooth, and even the tiny details like the door arch and window frames came out crisp. No stringing, no layer shifts, and no elephant’s foot at the base. Like most major manufacturers of 3D printers, Bambu providers its own slicer software, called Bambu Studio. Those familiar with PrusaSlicer will find Bambu Studio to be instantly familiar, and for a good reason: it’s a direct fork. Indeed, Bambu Lab has taken the well-loved PrusaSlicer framework and enhanced it with features tailored specifically for their printers, such as seamless integration with the AMS system for multi-material printing and optimized profiles for high-speed, high-quality results. Bambu Lab’s own slicer software impressed me from the start with its clean interface and intelligent default settings, but I soon discovered OrcaSlicer (a fork of Bambu Studio) after seeing it repeatedly recommended in online communities. While OrcaSlicer’s standout advantage is its superior compatibility with non-Bambu printers, I personally use it from time to time mainly because it supports some advance print settings that Bambu Studio doesn’t. For instance, I often find myself turning to OrcaSlicer specifically for its mouse ears brim feature – small circular additions to the brim that provide extra adhesion exactly where needed. Like many new 3D printer owners, I needed a practical project to justify the purchase to my skeptical spouse, and our Ikea sofa provided one. You see, it’s low-profile legs created a black hole for toys – anything that rolled under it was effectively lost until our next major furniture-moving cleaning session. This was my chance. Using TinkerCAD (a free, browser-based 3D modeling tool), I designed a set of sleeve-like adapters that could slide over the sofa’s legs while providing mounting points for a wooden barrier. The print took a few hours using Bambu’s black PLA filament, and the results exceeded my expectations. The adapters fit perfectly, and now our living room floor stays toy-free. Encouraged by this success, I started looking for other household challenges to tackle. A broken dishwasher soap dispenser clip? Printed a replacement in 30 minutes. Our oddly-sized shower drain that no standard plug would fit? Designed and printed a custom solution that works better than anything we could have bought. But I have to admit, while practical projects justified the purchase, toys for my kids make up the bulk of my printing these days. This is where Bambu Lab’s MakerWorld website has become an invaluable resource. It’s a community platform that hosts thousands of 3D models, many with pre-configured print profiles specifically optimized for the A1 Mini. My kids have been particularly delighted with the custom Duplo-compatible bricks I’ve printed. The adapters that let them connect their Duplo blocks to wooden Brio train tracks were an instant hit. We’ve also printed specialized pieces like a working crane tower, custom railway switches, and even a replica John Deere tractor in perfect Duplo scale. One of their favorites is a series of elevated train track pieces that let them build more complex railway layouts than what’s possible with standard Duplo tracks. Thanks to the pre-configured profiles on MakerWorld and the A1 Mini’s automated calibration, most prints succeed on the first try and look fantastic without any additional work required. I simply download a model, send it to the printer, and come back a few hours later to find exactly what I wanted. While the A1 Mini has been a remarkably reliable printer, I did encounter two minor issues that were easily solved with, ironically enough, 3D printing. The first quirk was somewhat messy: the printer would occasionally flick bits of purged filament (affectionately known as “filament poop” in the 3D printing community) onto the floor around the printer. A quick search on MakerWorld revealed dozens of community-designed solutions for this problem. I opted for the “Compact Poop Bucket” design, which catches these bits of waste filament neatly and can be easily emptied when full. The sheer number of different catch solutions available is actually quite amusing – whether you want something purely functional or a design that turns the waste collection into a decorative feature, you’ll find it in the community. The second issue was more annoying and potentially problematic. In its stock configuration, the A1 Mini’s filament guide moves up and down with the Z-axis. During calibration routines or tall prints, this movement sometimes caused the filament to slip off the spool or become tangled – not exactly what you want to discover halfway through a long print. Thankfully, another community-designed solution came to the rescue: a top-mounted Bowden guide that attaches to the top of the Z-axis tower. This keeps the filament path consistent regardless of the print head’s height, completely eliminating the tangling issues. I’ve also printed several quality-of-life improvements, like covers for the printer’s various ports and cable management clips. While none of these upgrades were strictly necessary, they’ve helped keep my setup tidy and protected. It’s somewhat meta that one of the best uses for a 3D printer is printing improvements for itself, but that’s part of what makes this hobby so engaging, especially if you take the time to learn a CAD software tool and gain the ability to create your own 3D models.

Title: Instead of AirPods, I'd recommend Meta Ray-Bans as the best tech deal of Black Friday 2024

'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean? ZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping. We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites. And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services we’re assessing. When you click through from our site to a retailer and buy a product or service, we may earn affiliate commissions. This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay. Neither ZDNET nor the author are compensated for these independent reviews.

Our goal is to deliver the most accurate information and the most knowledgeable advice possible in order to help you make smarter buying decisions on tech gear and a wide array of products and services.

If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form. The Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit among the most popular tech products of 2024. For a Black Friday deal available through Saturday, Nov. 30, you can grab a pair for the equivalent of $149 through a special two-part deal. Amazon is offering the Meta Ray-Bans with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). And through Nov. 30, you also get a $90 digital credit that you can use for other holiday shopping on Amazon. Assuming you can use that Amazon credit toward other things you would have bought anyway, that means you can snag a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses for the equivalent of 50% off. The 20% deal may stick around, but the $90 credit is scheduled to end on Saturday, Nov. 30 -- so act quickly if you want to grab that one. Also: The best Black Friday deals still available This is an especially awesome deal when you consider the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 and have rarely been discounted. They look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your glasses prescription. The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303, and the $90 credit brings the equivalent cost down to $213 -- still a terrific deal. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more and you can get them for roughly of the same price -- if you count the Amazon credit. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we constantly find new chances to save and share them with you on ZDNET.com.

Title: SolarZero collapse: Government on the hook for $115m, Nicola Willis seeks urgent advice

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The Government has $115 million at risk from the collapse of SolarZero. Finance Minister Nicola Willis said she was seeking urgent advice on the SolarZero situation. She had no further comment. NZ Green Investment Finance - a “green investment bank” created by the previous Government to fund environmentally-friendly businesses - made a $145m debt facility available to SolarZero, as well as facilitating $220m in credit lines from international private lenders First Sentier Investors, Natixis Investment Managers and Société Générale. This morning, NZGF said: “A total of $365m from all lenders was available, but this was not fully drawn down at the point of SolarZero’s liquidation - and some had been repaid. “At the time of SolarZero’s liquidation, approximately $115m of NZGIF’s commitment was drawn down against installations.” SolarZero offered no-money-up-front solar panel installations, instead charging a monthly subscription over a 25-year contract. It quoted $177 for a four-person household. United States private equity giant BlackRock bought SolarZero from its Kiwi founders in a mid-2022 deal. The price was not disclosed, but the deal required Overseas Investment Office approval, implying it was above the OIO’s $100m assessment threshold. At the time it went into liquidation, it had 15,000 customers (which it framed as 40% of NZ solar installations) and 160 staff. The debt facilities organised by NZGIF were designed to “allow SolarZero’s residential solar portfolio to increase to 20,000+ owner-occupied homes”. Meanwhile, a SolarZero staffer, who confirmed his identity and role to the Herald, says he asked management for figures on the amount owing to staff. He said 160 staff were told they had been terminated at a 4pm meeting on Tuesday, with no notice period or holiday pay offered. He said he had been told by a member of SolarZero’s executive team that about $1.4m was owing in holiday pay and $1.6m for one-month notice pay. “We have about $300,000 outstanding with our contractors. And then our subcontractors - our field service providers around the country - are owed in total around $600,000. “Some of them are small operators and this could cause them to fold.” He described the sums involved - about $3.7m - as “chump change for a company like BlackRock”. He was planning to join a staff protest outside BlackRock’s Auckland office this afternoon - although he said he had fears for the turnout, given a number of those involved were on work visas. He said they feared being caught on camera by Immigration. The Herald put the staffer’s numbers to one of the liquidators, who did not immediately respond. The liquidators - Stephen Keen and Russell Moore of Grant Thornton - earlier indicated they would not comment until their first report, which is expected within five working days. BlackRock said in a statement to the Herald: “BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business, on behalf of the fund, held extensive discussions with various stakeholders over a period of time to explore and work through several options to reach an outcome that would meet the needs of various parties, which regrettably could not be brought to fruition. “The team is deeply disappointed with this outcome and has worked with the SolarZero board to appoint a liquidator to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others.” NZGIF said in a statement on Tuesday that “NZGIF was informed today that SolarZero’s sole shareholder BlackRock has placed the company into voluntary liquidation”. This morning it added in a statement: “The liquidator’s initial report is due in the next few days. However, it may take some time to understand the final financial implications under a range of scenarios”. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

November 28, 2024 17:15 ET | Source: Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF TORONTO, Nov. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlefield Limited (the “Manager”), the manager of Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF (TSX:MDIV) and Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF (TSX:MINF) (collectively, the “Funds”), is announcing its intention to de-emphasize the environmental, sustainability, and governance (“ESG”) factors associated with MINF and MDIV by revising the names, investment objectives and strategies of the Funds. There will be no change to the ticker symbols of the Funds. While the Funds will continue to consider ESG criteria when selecting issuers for their portfolios, they will no longer prioritize these factors over others such as valuation, growth projections, and the quality and track record of the management team. The Manager believes these changes will broaden the investment universe of the Funds, potentially leading to better returns for investors. The Manager notes that similar efforts to de-emphasize ESG factors have been undertaken by many asset management companies, including BlackRock, State Street, JPMorgan, and Pimco. Recent research from Morningstar has shown that more funds are removing rather than adding ESG mandates from their investment practices. On March 7, 2024, the Canadian Securities Administrators introduced three categories of ESG-Related Funds: ESG Objective Funds, ESG Strategy Funds, and ESG Limited Consideration Funds. Each category has distinct expectations regarding the emphasis on ESG factors in investment decisions. The Manager believes that the proposed changes will result in the Funds moving from the ESG Objective Funds category to the ESG Limited Consideration category. Special meetings of unitholders of the Funds will be held on or about January 30, 2025, at which unitholders of record as at December 23, 2024 will be asked to approve the revisions. Further details of the meeting, including the proposed changes to the investment objectives and strategies, will be provided in an information circular to be distributed to unitholders of the Funds in advance of the special meeting. If approved, changes will be reflected in the Prospectus renewal filing of the Funds, which is expected to occur in late March 2025.

Title: Middlefield Announces Intention to Revise Names and Reduce ESG Limitations for Two ETFs

November 28, 2024 17:10 ET | Source: Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF TORONTO, Nov. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlefield Limited (the “Manager”), the manager of Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF (TSX:MDIV) and Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF (TSX:MINF) (collectively, the “Funds”), is announcing its intention to de-emphasize the environmental, sustainability, and governance (“ESG”) factors associated with MINF and MDIV by revising the names, investment objectives and strategies of the Funds. There will be no change to the ticker symbols of the Funds. While the Funds will continue to consider ESG criteria when selecting issuers for their portfolios, they will no longer prioritize these factors over others such as valuation, growth projections, and the quality and track record of the management team. The Manager believes these changes will broaden the investment universe of the Funds, potentially leading to better returns for investors. The Manager notes that similar efforts to de-emphasize ESG factors have been undertaken by many asset management companies, including BlackRock, State Street, JPMorgan, and Pimco. Recent research from Morningstar has shown that more funds are removing rather than adding ESG mandates from their investment practices. On March 7, 2024, the Canadian Securities Administrators introduced three categories of ESG-Related Funds: ESG Objective Funds, ESG Strategy Funds, and ESG Limited Consideration Funds. Each category has distinct expectations regarding the emphasis on ESG factors in investment decisions. The Manager believes that the proposed changes will result in the Funds moving from the ESG Objective Funds category to the ESG Limited Consideration category. Special meetings of unitholders of the Funds will be held on or about January 30, 2025, at which unitholders of record as at December 23, 2024 will be asked to approve the revisions. Further details of the meeting, including the proposed changes to the investment objectives and strategies, will be provided in an information circular to be distributed to unitholders of the Funds in advance of the special meeting. If approved, changes will be reflected in the Prospectus renewal filing of the Funds, which is expected to occur in late March 2025.

Title: Veterans Harmed by Biden Policies Propose List of Nominees for Incoming Trump Administration

A community of military veterans who fought against initiatives from the Biden administration they deemed unconstitutional have put together a list of 18 names they would like to see appointed to positions in the incoming Trump administration to help President-elect Donald Trump implement reform in the Pentagon or other agencies. Representatives of the community, which consists of 80,000 disaffected veterans whose military careers were ended or damaged after they challenged the Biden administration’s policies, said the list was peer-nominated. “These men and women come from field grade and general officer ranks, have staff experience within the DoD headquarters establishment, and have led exemplary careers within the military, government, and private sector. They have each proven themselves as dedicated public servants, standing fast to their duty to defend the Constitution at great peril to their personal interests,” they said in a statement accompanying the names. “These names do not belong to a special interest group or have vested personal interest, they are merely willing to serve their country again as trusted stewards of the American People,” they added. The names are: “Every American should pay attention to this list, as it represents real leaders who care about the country and constitution over self-interest and institutions,” Air Force veteran and spokeswoman for the group, Kacy Dixon, said. The group putting forward the names first came together as they fought against the Biden Pentagon’s COVID vaccine mandate, which led to the involuntarily discharge of more than 8,000 troops and thousands more who chose to leave. Earlier this year, they drafted the Declaration of Military Accountability, which calls for holding senior military leaders accountable. They have also expanded their call for accountability to the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, government waste, and the DEI agenda. Representative of the group Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Carolyn Rocco said in a statement, “These 18 are the vanguard of over 200 grassroots nominations that are proven courageous public servants ready to restore the military. Each nominee carries unique professional qualifications and has demonstrated their dedication to duty.” Air Force veteran Jordan Karr added, “The rank and file intend to recommend a powerful support team for the future SECDEF; a team that he can count on to restore purpose, unity, and trust to our armed forces.” The group said an additional list of hundreds more names is available upon request.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Uber, the ride-hailing company that has yet to catch onto the AI boom, is reportedly expanding its fleet of gig workers for a new project aimed at AI annotation and data labeling. According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. The report adds that these workers complete projects for internal business units at the ride hailing company but are also serving outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic. The company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the US, Canada, and India, among others.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s Been ‘Consistently Bullish on Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI)’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's List of 7 Energy Stocks for the Trump Trade. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) stands against the other energy stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his views on the future of the natural gas and oil sectors under President-elect Donald Trump's administration, alongside a majority Republican Congress. Cramer expressed his belief that companies involved in the natural gas ecosystem will thrive as a result of this new political landscape. He pointed out that the United States is rich in natural gas resources, which can be produced cheaply. While some may believe the country’s position in terms of natural gas production is lower than expected, Cramer noted that, due to the Biden administration’s unfriendly stance toward fossil fuels and a weaker global economy, the natural gas industry had underperformed for much of the year. However, Cramer is optimistic that this trend will soon shift. He emphasized that although the U.S. has vast natural gas reserves, there has been a lack of infrastructure to effectively transport the resource, a problem exacerbated by the Biden administration's resistance to new pipelines. This, according to Cramer, has hindered the industry. He specifically criticized the pause on new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export authorizations, calling it a stunning setback for one of the country’s strongest sectors, which provides thousands of high-paying jobs. He went on to say: “The betting is that Trump's going to undo that on day one, giving new life to all these LNG projects that really have been stuck in limbo.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 13 Stocks in Focus and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight Since the election, natural gas prices have surged more than 70%, although Cramer noted that this increase was partly driven by a cold snap after a warm fall and the delayed start to winter. “Seasonally, this is a good time for the commodity but I also think there’s some optimism about the future of the industry driving this move.” Cramer then shared his broader outlook, saying: “But here's the bottom line: We’re hearing about all sorts of Trump trades right now, and many of these things have made insane moves in less than three weeks, to the point where, actually, they’re feeling precarious to me.” He went on to recommend natural gas as a more sustainable investment, emphasizing that while many sectors have already surged in the wake of the election, natural gas stands out as an industry with long-term potential. Cramer believes that with the incoming administration’s supportive stance toward the fossil fuel sector, the natural gas ecosystem will continue to thrive for years to come. He suggested that investors should look to buy into producers, pipeline companies, and LNG export stocks, all of which he believes have further upside potential now that the regulatory environment has shifted. “I bet they keep running for the next couple of years, not months. They have all moved but they're nowhere versus where they could go now that Biden's anti-fossil fuel team has been broomed for one that is totally supportive of this industry.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during a recent episode of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial view of an oil and gas pipeline, spanning vast landscapes. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Cramer suggested that pipelines could be a strong investment for those anticipating a natural gas boom under Trump, including Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI), “Other than the producers, what works if you're betting on a natural gas renaissance under Trump… How about a pure play on pipelines? Much easier to build these under a Republican administration. There are plenty of good options here. I've been consistently bullish on Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan, they yield 6.8% and 4.0%, respectively.” Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is an energy infrastructure company, focusing on the transportation, storage, and processing of natural gas, petroleum products, and other commodities, along with CO2 production and related facilities. The company operates one of the largest natural gas transmission networks in the United States, holding an interest in or managing approximately 79,000 miles of pipelines and 139 terminals. It also oversees 702 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas storage capacity and generates about 6.1 Bcf of renewable natural gas annually, with another 0.8 Bcf in development. Additionally, the company transports more than 40% of the country’s natural gas production. The company has a strong project pipeline, with a backlog valued at $5.1 billion. According to Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) management, there are considerable growth opportunities in natural gas, particularly in areas such as LNG exports, cross-border exports to Mexico, power generation, and industrial demand. The company is currently involved in discussions about power opportunities that could exceed 5 Bcf a day, and its internal projections suggest an overall growth of approximately 25 Bcf a day in the natural gas market over the next five years. Overall KMI ranks 3rd on Jim Cramer's list of energy stocks for the Trump trade. While we acknowledge the potential of KMI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KMI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In fact, this company is increasingly encroaching on Nvidia's turf. No incoming president has ever inherited a more challenging scenario. The fledgling quantum computing company has some ambitious plans. Billionaire Ron Baron is the founder and CEO of Baron Capital Group, an investment advisor and fund manager. Baron is undoubtedly one of the biggest Tesla bulls on Wall Street. The stock accounts for 33% of the Baron Partners Fund, which has returned 195% during the last five years, beating the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by more than 100 percentage points. On CNBC's “Mad Money Lightning Round,” Jim Cramer recommended buying Symbotic (NYSE:SYM). He added, “This is a very hot sector. The good news here, this company does make money.” On Nov. 18, Symbotic reported quarterly earnings of five cents per ... If you want to learn where artificial intelligence (AI) could be heading, you'll probably want to pay attention to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang. After all, Huang's company is arguably the most important player in the AI world right now. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the gold standard for powering large-scale AI models. It's always a good time to buy dividend stocks, but when the market is volatile, it's even more important. There has been global macroeconomic volatility as high inflation persists in some regions, and President-elect Donald Trump's financial agenda could spark change in the U.S. economy. What that means, of course, is that you want to have some solid, reliable dividend stocks in your portfolio. Despite being a net seller of stocks to the tune of $166 billion over the last eight quarters, there are two premier stocks the Oracle of Omaha can't stop buying. Down by 92% since its initial public offering (IPO) in November 2021, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) highlights the risks of buying a stock too early. When it hit public markets in 2021, Rivian was the second most valuable U.S. automaker in the world, behind Tesla. With a market cap of over $100 billion, it dwarfed rivals like Ford Motor Company and General Motors despite reporting barely any revenue. In the closing of the recent trading day, Tilray Brands, Inc. (TLRY) stood at $1.37, denoting a +0.74% change from the preceding trading day. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: We uncovered 57 online clothing shops trying to scam Australians. And they’re just the tip of the iceberg

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN By Lucy Carter By Matt Martino By Michael Workman ABC NEWS Verify Topic:Retail Industry At first glance, Vogue Melbourne looks every inch an upmarket Australian boutique. The website features photos of models in fashionable clothes and slogans like "Be You Be Beautiful". It boasts 100,000 satisfied customers, an extensive catalogue of items and claims to accept a range of reputable payment options. Look a little closer though and things aren't quite what they seem. You might have noticed that the site is advertising a Halloween sale with up to 50 per cent discounts. Halloween came and went at the end of October, but that sale has continued. Since ABC NEWS Verify started monitoring this site in early October, there has always been an up to 50 per cent discount advertised. Back then, it was called a "winter sale". Let's look closer at one product: this dress. It looks like a professionally taken photograph of a stylish garment. The site even gives it a "trademarked" name "Annaliese". The photos appear to have come from London fashion brand House of CB. The garment is the Lolita Apricot Corset Sundress, for sale with House of CB for $322 (currently on sale for $261). We also found the same photographs advertising the dress on Chinese shopping website AliExpress for as little as $19.09. So either Vogue Melbourne is getting a sweet deal on a designer fashion item, or it is shipping a cheap knock off. As the name — and this sandwich board — suggest, Vogue Melbourne claims to have a physical presence in Victoria's capital. It even lists a physical address on the home page, placing it inside Melbourne's upmarket Emporium shopping centre. But this image has been generated from a custom stock image company. And it's unlikely that a Sydney store will be opening anytime soon when there's no record of the Melbourne store inside the Emporium mall. Then there are the reviews. The site appears to be displaying an authentic Trustpilot review system, a legitimate website which allows customers to provide public feedback about businesses. Vogue Melbourne claims its Trustpilot rating is excellent — but again, it's a fake. The actual rating according to the real Trustpilot site? Bad. But surely it's not all negative, right? At least Vogue Melbourne offers a 30-day, money-back guarantee? Well, the site's real Trustpilot page is full of stories of that promise not being kept by the store. Vogue Melbourne presents itself as a high-end, Australian fashion retailer. But as you can see, it is anything but. ABC NEWS Verify has discovered many more sites just like it, all convincing Australians to part with their money, sometimes for an inferior product and sometimes for no product at all … How social media is giving scammers the tools they need to trick Australians into parting with their money. Vogue Melbourne is one of more than 50 shopping websites ABC NEWS Verify has tracked over several months that appear to be falsely representing themselves online as high-end Australian retailers. Almost exclusively run from overseas, the websites are mass-produced digital stores sometimes selling cheap and often poor-quality products imported directly from Asia. They have a strong and seemingly unchecked presence on Meta's social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. Despite having names like Sydney Stylista, Beaumont Gold Coast and Perth Apparel, Facebook transparency information often shows these pages have several administrators outside of Australia. Nonetheless, social media giant Meta allows these pages to run ads on its platforms that target Australians and funnel them to their websites. Many of the ads use similar language, and sometimes the same images that tug at the heart strings of shoppers, with talk of closing down sales, and shop fires. While there's nothing illegal about shipping goods in from another country, customers are being tricked into thinking they are shopping locally. They're left with little practical recourse for international returns or exchanges, and often hundreds of dollars out of pocket. Meta didn't respond directly to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify by time of publication, but confirmed they are looking into the flagged pages. "We are investigating this matter. Meta doesn't want scams on our platforms, and we are continuing to invest in tools and technology to prevent them. The safety of our users is of utmost importance, and we continue to work with industry, the government and law enforcement to protect Australians from scams." The 57 online stores ABC NEWS Verify has tracked are managed and run by different people and groups but have a very similar look online. The websites appear to have been designed and created using common templates on the e-commerce platform Shopify. They then advertise heavily on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The products they sell are mostly mass-produced fast-fashion items, commonly produced in Asia. The sites all use a legal supply chain model called dropshipping. The product you receive has often been shipped from an entirely different country, without any direct handling from the seller. Normally, when you make a purchase on a website … … it's the retailer who ships the product directly to you. But with dropshipping, the retailer places an order with a supplier, who could be located in a completely different country. That supplier then ships the item directly to you, without the involvement of the retailer who you placed the order with. So what happens when you want to make a return or exchange? Some of these dropshipping websites offer them for "free". But you can't just return your item to the online store that you bought from. Buried in the returns policy fine print of many of the stores we investigated, was a clause which states returns are shipped back to a central warehouse in Asia. That's the original supplier. And while the buyer could possibly get their money back … … what they're often surprised to learn, often buried in the fine print, is that they have to foot the international shipping bill to send the item back to the supplier. This can sometimes be close to or equal the amount paid for the item in the first place. This is difficult for consumer regulators to police, as while dropshipping is a perfectly legal business model, where this scam begins is the misleading tactics being used to deceive shoppers into thinking they've been dealing with a local business. This can leave customers feeling misled, dissatisfied and out-of-pocket. Rosie Thomas, the director of campaigns at consumer watchdog Choice told ABC NEWS Verify that after thinking you've been dealing with an Australian business, the idea that you would have to pay to ship the item back overseas to return it often comes as "quite a shock". "Even if you return the item, if you don't get the refund, or you don't get the response that you would like, there are limited options in the digital environment as to where you can take your complaint." Catriona Lowe, the deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission told ABC NEWS Verify that all customers shopping online in Australia — even with international operators — have rights. "All businesses that trade in Australia are required to comply with the Australian consumer law, and that includes not misleading consumers about where your business is based." "If consumers do feel that they've been misled by this conduct, we encourage them to get in contact either with our info centre or with their state and territory fair trading agencies." Retired music teacher Julie (not her real name) was excited when she spotted a colourful knitted jumper advertised for sale on Instagram by the now-defunct online store Aussie Hilda. At $84 the jumper wasn't an insignificant purchase for the aged pensioner, but she reasoned that its 'original price', at $250, was listed far higher and that she may have stumbled onto a bargain. "Very naively, my mind thought that it was a good quality item and it had been reduced. I thought it was coming from Australia. And I thought if there's any problem with it, I'll be able to just send it back to Australia, probably to Melbourne," she said. What arrived in the post several weeks later was far from the high-quality warm jumper she was expecting. Instead it was a low-quality polyester fabric with the pattern of a knit printed onto it. "I was just absolutely shocked to the socks about it, because it was just such a complete piece of garbage. "Thin plastic-y fabric has been used to make the jumper and then something is stamped onto it at the front and the back." The ACCC's Catriona Lowe says it appears Julie has the right to lodge a formal complaint. "It is incredibly important that the business is not misleading consumers about the nature of their business, about what they might expect in terms of delivery times and of course, that what they are purchasing, or what they can see online, matches what they ultimately are delivered." A second shock came when Julie tried to return the item and arrange a refund. "They said I'd have to send it back to some address in China somewhere, and that I would have to pay the postage to which I said to them, 'well, it's going to cost me almost the same amount in postage as it cost me for the actual item'," Julie said. Julie is one of more than 40 disgruntled customers of these websites that ABC NEWS Verify has spoken to as part of this investigation. She eventually managed to obtain a refund through PayPal after weeks of frustrating back and forth with Aussie Hilda administrators, who appear to be located in Indonesia. Extraordinarily, when the 73-year-old Sydneysider reported the page to Instagram's parent company Meta for its deceptive behaviour, she says her account was temporarily blocked, while Aussie Hilda's page remained active and advertising for many more weeks. "I would never buy anything through Instagram or Facebook again," she said. Choice's Ms Thomas says Meta needs to do much more. "We think, at a minimum, Meta should be verifying the identities of the businesses that it's taking money from to advertise on their platforms. "This would ensure that those businesses are who they say they are. And in the case of scams, should pick up whether or not it is an impersonation and and there's a significant risk for consumers." One of the most common deceptions we've seen the 57 tracked websites use is fake product reviews. In addition to the fake Trustpilot reviews highlighted earlier, many of these sites also display fake unbranded testimonials often using stock or AI generated images. The familiar names on these reviews below, for example, give away the game. The names do not even match the supplied photographs. These fake reviews often have wording that no human would ever actually use. Using dated Australian slang like "cobber" and describing delivery as "quick as a rat up a drainpipe", they appear to be crafted to seem authentic to Australians but are anything but. The lies and AI carry over to many of the ads we see plastered across Meta's social media platforms — with claims of shops closing down, burning down and using artificially generated store owners. We've also tracked shops stealing or altering photos of real Australian shopfronts. Legitimate Melbourne store Kloke had no idea a photo of its very real store was being used by Wilson Melbourne on its Facebook page, until contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. Fake Sydney outlet TrendyOz is actually a badly photoshopped photo of a Calvin Klein store in Sydney's CBD Westfield. Online store Vogue Melbourne claims to be run by Garry Williams, an Australian physiotherapist and Cècile Laurent, a "talented" French fashion designer. Vogue Melbourne presents these photographs of "Garry" and "Cècile" on its About Us page. As we mentioned, it claims Garry is Australian, and Cècile is French. But Vogue Melbourne is not the only shopping website these images appear on. They're also here on Marlo London, which targets British customers. But this time, Garry is English. At Modezentrum Krause, which looks identical but targets German customers, the language changes … Cècile and her profession remain. Garry, meanwhile, has been replaced by "Thomas Krause", who is now a German physiotherapist. ABC NEWS Verify has established the real identities of both of these people using open source intelligence techniques. Both had their images taken from their own websites or social media accounts, apparently without their knowledge. "Garry" is actually a Dutch man, who we were not able to contact. And "Cècile" is an American woman named Cora, who expressed astonishment that her image had been stolen and used on these websites when contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. "I had no idea they were using my photo or claiming it was them in the photo. There was definitely no consent given on my part," she said. "It is extremely confusing why they would take my photo and say that they are the ones in it. They are trying to deceive people and it's quite sickening. It's also just frustrating because that is a photo of me working and taken by a professional photographer which makes me feel violated." These three websites appear to be connected to each other through a single operator, as well as to a fourth website, Averley Boutique Toronto. The websites list the same Dutch business name and number in their terms and service pages and ABC NEWS Verify has also documented them using the same PayPal as a payment beneficiary. The beneficiary is listed as NYH E-Commerce. According to Dutch business records, the company has a sole shareholder and employee named Nadir El Haddouti. The postal address for the business is this self-storage unit in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It isn't clear where Mr El Haddouti lives, but he has ties to both the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates through his Dutch-registered business. His business number is also listed on the website of a luxury car rental company based in Dubai as well as a consultancy business geared towards minimising value-added tax for dropshippers, based in the Netherlands. Dutch business records show the operations related to his business number include the "renting of passenger cars and light motor vehicles" and "retail sale via internet of apparel and clothing accessories". Social media accounts belonging to the luxury car rental business, Carplug Dubai, suggest the operator mixes with others living opulent lifestyles. For instance, one video, which shows a young man revving a performance car valued at over $100,000, is captioned in Dutch "Samen met de jongste CEO van NL". This translates to "Together with the youngest CEO of NL [the Netherlands]". ABC NEWS Verify attempted to contact Mr El Haddouti through various channels, but received no response. Opaque ownership is common to the 57 pages tracked by ABC NEWS Verify. We detected ties to individuals based overseas in all the sites we tracked. Links to the Netherlands were frequently found among this cohort. Operating a business outside of Australia that dropships goods into the country is something that is perfectly legal and thus, outside the scope of regulators. Where it becomes a problem is when consumers think they are dealing with a local business, and all the imputations of quality and ease of dealings that come with that assumption. There's a whole industry built around creating websites just like these on gig economy websites like Fiverr. ABC NEWS Verify has seen a range of different prices and delivery times for fully operational shopping websites offered on that platform. The cheapest and quickest we came across was a 10-product website with a three-day delivery time for just under $50. We saw prices on other accounts for as much as $1,000 for a 50-product store delivered in a week. Some of these sellers go on to offer to manage the marketing and operation of the page for several hundred of dollars a month. ABC NEWS Verify also came across multiple websites that were almost identical in layout. We know the websites were being operated by different people because the PayPal beneficiaries were different, and their Facebook pages listed administrators in different countries. These four seemingly unrelated pages all appear to be modelled from a website called Sol and Sparrow Melbourne. Whoever built the three copies hasn't even bothered to delete Sol and Sparrow's name from the body copy on some of their product pages and some use the very same images. Shopify didn't respond to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify but a spokesperson confirmed it was investigating the online shops flagged. "Shopify's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) clearly outlines what is not permitted on our platform. We're reviewing these stores and will take action on any found to violate our policies." There are now a range of companies online that allow these websites to be created with ease and at scale, meaning purveyors can dropship to anywhere in the world with little effort. It's clear these Australian-targeted websites we have uncovered are just the tip of an international iceberg. Remember that dress from before? A simple reverse image search shows a raft of similar internationally-focused websites on which it appears. This grift is truly global. As shoppers wade through Black Friday sales and then into Christmas shopping, many might be asking how they can keep themselves safe when seeking to buy high quality and good value products online. ABC NEWS Verify asked our experts from Choice and the ACCC for their top tips when it comes to shopping online and avoiding scams. Ms Thomas from Choice says slowing down is key. "Scam ads or fraudulent retailer ads very likely will create a sense of urgency to try and make you act quickly. "Take a moment to check the website, check the URL, see if there are any red flags that suggest that maybe this business is not what you think it is." (It's worth mentioning that none of the URLs we encountered in our investigation carried a .au Australian domain, though its presence in a URL doesn't necessarily mean the site you're looking at is not a scam.) Catriona Lowe from the ACCC agrees that doing a bit of homework can save heartache later on. Being skeptical of reviews posted directly on the website is a good start. "Be wary of websites that you're not familiar with, including if you might have received adverts about them on social media," she said. A really good thing to do is to check online forums and review sites, because often you might, you might find that other consumers will be talking. "And then the last tip that we give to people is, if you are feeling a little cautious you may wish to shop with a credit or debit card. What that means is, if something does go wrong, you may have the right to do what's called a chargeback, and that means actually reversing that transaction with your financial institution, rather than the particular business that you might have given those details to." ABC NEWS Verify spent months documenting and investigating overseas dropshipping operations that falsely claimed to have a physical presence in Australia. The operations were identified by reviewing advertisements targeting Australians on Meta's platforms like Facebook along with keyword searches of Meta's ad library. Our investigation focused on stores that had an implied and or explicit physical presence in Australia — ranging from stores using Australian locations in their names to dropshipping stores creating digital images of fake physical shop fronts in Australian locations. ABC NEWS Verify then investigated who was behind them, unearthing links across the globe including ties to countries such as the Netherlands, UAE, China and the United States. Our investigation also helped unveil some of the common tactics and practices these kinds of operations deploy. Although ABC NEWS Verify uncovered the identity of several overseas individuals and businesses linked to some stores, most remain opaque, due in part to measures by the operators to mask their ownership and because of the transparency limitations of the Australian version of Meta's ad library. Although Meta has greater transparency on digital ads than some other digital platforms, the company's ad transparency in Australia is limited compared to some jurisdictions like the EU. Meta in the EU is subject to the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) which, once introduced, compelled Meta to display and archive all ads that targeted people in the EU, and store them for a year. Detecting scammers and others abusing Meta's platforms in Australia remains a "whack-a-mole" exercise — one exacerbated by Meta's closure of the transparency tool CrowdTangle earlier this year.

Title: We uncovered 57 online clothing shops trying to scam Australians. And they’re just the tip of the iceberg

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN By Lucy Carter By Matt Martino By Michael Workman ABC NEWS Verify Topic:Retail Industry At first glance, Vogue Melbourne looks every inch an upmarket Australian boutique. The website features photos of models in fashionable clothes and slogans like "Be You Be Beautiful". It boasts 100,000 satisfied customers, an extensive catalogue of items and claims to accept a range of reputable payment options. Look a little closer though and things aren't quite what they seem. You might have noticed that the site is advertising a Halloween sale with up to 50 per cent discounts. Halloween came and went at the end of October, but that sale has continued. Since ABC NEWS Verify started monitoring this site in early October, there has always been an up to 50 per cent discount advertised. Back then, it was called a "winter sale". Let's look closer at one product: this dress. It looks like a professionally taken photograph of a stylish garment. The site even gives it a "trademarked" name "Annaliese". The photos appear to have come from London fashion brand House of CB. The garment is the Lolita Apricot Corset Sundress, for sale with House of CB for $322 (currently on sale for $261). We also found the same photographs advertising the dress on Chinese shopping website AliExpress for as little as $19.09. So either Vogue Melbourne is getting a sweet deal on a designer fashion item, or it is shipping a cheap knock off. As the name — and this sandwich board — suggest, Vogue Melbourne claims to have a physical presence in Victoria's capital. It even lists a physical address on the home page, placing it inside Melbourne's upmarket Emporium shopping centre. But this image has been generated from a custom stock image company. And it's unlikely that a Sydney store will be opening anytime soon when there's no record of the Melbourne store inside the Emporium mall. Then there are the reviews. The site appears to be displaying an authentic Trustpilot review system, a legitimate website which allows customers to provide public feedback about businesses. Vogue Melbourne claims its Trustpilot rating is excellent — but again, it's a fake. The actual rating according to the real Trustpilot site? Bad. But surely it's not all negative, right? At least Vogue Melbourne offers a 30-day, money-back guarantee? Well, the site's real Trustpilot page is full of stories of that promise not being kept by the store. Vogue Melbourne presents itself as a high-end, Australian fashion retailer. But as you can see, it is anything but. ABC NEWS Verify has discovered many more sites just like it, all convincing Australians to part with their money, sometimes for an inferior product and sometimes for no product at all … How social media is giving scammers the tools they need to trick Australians into parting with their money. Vogue Melbourne is one of more than 50 shopping websites ABC NEWS Verify has tracked over several months that appear to be falsely representing themselves online as high-end Australian retailers. Almost exclusively run from overseas, the websites are mass-produced digital stores sometimes selling cheap and often poor-quality products imported directly from Asia. They have a strong and seemingly unchecked presence on Meta's social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. Despite having names like Sydney Stylista, Beaumont Gold Coast and Perth Apparel, Facebook transparency information often shows these pages have several administrators outside of Australia. Nonetheless, social media giant Meta allows these pages to run ads on its platforms that target Australians and funnel them to their websites. Many of the ads use similar language, and sometimes the same images that tug at the heart strings of shoppers, with talk of closing down sales, and shop fires. While there's nothing illegal about shipping goods in from another country, customers are being tricked into thinking they are shopping locally. They're left with little practical recourse for international returns or exchanges, and often hundreds of dollars out of pocket. Meta didn't respond directly to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify by time of publication, but confirmed they are looking into the flagged pages. "We are investigating this matter. Meta doesn't want scams on our platforms, and we are continuing to invest in tools and technology to prevent them. The safety of our users is of utmost importance, and we continue to work with industry, the government and law enforcement to protect Australians from scams." The 57 online stores ABC NEWS Verify has tracked are managed and run by different people and groups but have a very similar look online. The websites appear to have been designed and created using common templates on the e-commerce platform Shopify. They then advertise heavily on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The products they sell are mostly mass-produced fast-fashion items, commonly produced in Asia. The sites all use a legal supply chain model called dropshipping. The product you receive has often been shipped from an entirely different country, without any direct handling from the seller. Normally, when you make a purchase on a website … … it's the retailer who ships the product directly to you. But with dropshipping, the retailer places an order with a supplier, who could be located in a completely different country. That supplier then ships the item directly to you, without the involvement of the retailer who you placed the order with. So what happens when you want to make a return or exchange? Some of these dropshipping websites offer them for "free". But you can't just return your item to the online store that you bought from. Buried in the returns policy fine print of many of the stores we investigated, was a clause which states returns are shipped back to a central warehouse in Asia. That's the original supplier. And while the buyer could possibly get their money back … … what they're often surprised to learn, often buried in the fine print, is that they have to foot the international shipping bill to send the item back to the supplier. This can sometimes be close to or equal the amount paid for the item in the first place. This is difficult for consumer regulators to police, as while dropshipping is a perfectly legal business model, where this scam begins is the misleading tactics being used to deceive shoppers into thinking they've been dealing with a local business. This can leave customers feeling misled, dissatisfied and out-of-pocket. Rosie Thomas, the director of campaigns at consumer watchdog Choice told ABC NEWS Verify that after thinking you've been dealing with an Australian business, the idea that you would have to pay to ship the item back overseas to return it often comes as "quite a shock". "Even if you return the item, if you don't get the refund, or you don't get the response that you would like, there are limited options in the digital environment as to where you can take your complaint." Catriona Lowe, the deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission told ABC NEWS Verify that all customers shopping online in Australia — even with international operators — have rights. "All businesses that trade in Australia are required to comply with the Australian consumer law, and that includes not misleading consumers about where your business is based." "If consumers do feel that they've been misled by this conduct, we encourage them to get in contact either with our info centre or with their state and territory fair trading agencies." Retired music teacher Julie (not her real name) was excited when she spotted a colourful knitted jumper advertised for sale on Instagram by the now-defunct online store Aussie Hilda. At $84 the jumper wasn't an insignificant purchase for the aged pensioner, but she reasoned that its 'original price', at $250, was listed far higher and that she may have stumbled onto a bargain. "Very naively, my mind thought that it was a good quality item and it had been reduced. I thought it was coming from Australia. And I thought if there's any problem with it, I'll be able to just send it back to Australia, probably to Melbourne," she said. What arrived in the post several weeks later was far from the high-quality warm jumper she was expecting. Instead it was a low-quality polyester fabric with the pattern of a knit printed onto it. "I was just absolutely shocked to the socks about it, because it was just such a complete piece of garbage. "Thin plastic-y fabric has been used to make the jumper and then something is stamped onto it at the front and the back." The ACCC's Catriona Lowe says it appears Julie has the right to lodge a formal complaint. "It is incredibly important that the business is not misleading consumers about the nature of their business, about what they might expect in terms of delivery times and of course, that what they are purchasing, or what they can see online, matches what they ultimately are delivered." A second shock came when Julie tried to return the item and arrange a refund. "They said I'd have to send it back to some address in China somewhere, and that I would have to pay the postage to which I said to them, 'well, it's going to cost me almost the same amount in postage as it cost me for the actual item'," Julie said. Julie is one of more than 40 disgruntled customers of these websites that ABC NEWS Verify has spoken to as part of this investigation.

The 55-inch LG OLED C4 is finally at the price I've been hoping for When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I have been hoping, saving, and waiting for a Black Friday OLED TV deal this year. I got a 4K TV in August of 2020, and although it's served me very well, it's starting to get backlight bleed - an annoying degradation of the display where its backlight rings shine through the panel and become easy to spot. As someone who reviews all sorts of technology for a living, I know that OLED TVs are the ones worth spending money on these days, but they're not the easiest to afford. This year I've been scraping money together where I can, and I've been watching the price of LG's 55-inch OLED C4 like a hawk because I know that it's the perfect TV for me, but this brand's screens only enter my price range once or twice a year. I've been waiting for it to drop as close to the $1,000 mark as possible - mainly because I still want to be able to pay my rent. Black Friday has finally delivered the goods, because it's now down to $1,196.99 at Amazon, giving it a $300 discount. Besides a blip on the price history data that sort of looks like someone pressed the wrong button somewhere, this is the cheapest this screen has ever fallen to. A brief Black Friday OLED TV deal brought it down to $1,096 about two weeks ago before it was immediately hoisted back upward. The 55-inch models of LG's OLEDs can be tough to find deals for because they're one of the most popular sizes in the range, and stock can disappear in a heartbeat. LG OLED C4 55-inch TV | $1,499.99 $1,196.99 at AmazonSave $300 - This is likely as close to the $1,000 mark you'll find this display drop to before it starts being replaced by the inevitable C5. Sometimes you see this model get discounts in February as LG tries to get rid of stock, but it can be really tough to find good deals on these TVs from this point on. Buy it if: ✅ You want one of the best pound-for-pound gaming TVs on the market✅ You want a screen with a high refresh rate✅ You've been waiting for a good deal Don't buy it if: ❌ You can make do with a slower refresh rate❌ You need to keep saving for now Price check: $1,296 at Walmart | $1,199.99 at Best Buy UK: £1,199 at Currys So why is it the LG OLED C4 that I'm so desperate to go for? Other brands do make OLED displays these days, and some of them can be a bit cheaper than LG. Well, for starters, I know that LG is the company that makes the OLED technology for a lot of smaller TV brands, so you know you're getting the purest form of panel straight from the source if you buy from them. Next, it's the 55-inch size I'm looking for because that suits my home the most. A 65-inch 4K display might actually look like better quality due to viewing distances and pixel densities, but I think that size of screen would be a bit intense for the room I'd put it in. I think 55-inch is the best value spot for a living room screen size worth investing in, without overspending on the sizes TV manufacturers tell you you need. Then there are specs, which might help you to decide which of the best gaming TVs is the best for you. I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, and my time for viewing them is sacred. I want to make it as close to a cinema atmosphere as possible, and an OLED panel combined with Dolby Vision support will really bring that feeling home. Next, I want to use it for PC gaming, so I'd like a high refresh rate. The C4 sports a stunning 144Hz refresh rate that my Maingear Zero Ruby will absolutely be able to make use of. I wouldn't wait around if any of this sounds relatable to you. LG OLEDs are popular choices, and I'd expect the 55-inch model to fly off the shelves this Black Friday. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more There are other offers to make the most of if this is out of your price range. Black Friday Meta Quest deals, Black Friday Xbox deals, and Black Friday CPU deals might get you a bigger saving that's more achievable for you. One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote If younger me could see how much this 4K 144Hz gaming TV is this Black Friday, they'd tell me I'm full of it I'd recommend the Samsung Odyssey OLED G6 all day for 1440p gaming, and Black Friday just made it more affordable The battle to be the highest-rated game of the year continues as Astro Bot finally claims the top spot from Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: Consumer Debt, Trump, and Precious Metals: Insights from Greg Weldon

November 28, 2024 By Money Metals Exchange Mike Maharrey, reporter and analyst at Money Metals Exchange, interviewed Greg Weldon, CEO of Weldon Financial and editor of newsletters such as Weldon’s Money Monitor and Metal Monitor. Weldon, often referred to as “The Gold Guru,” shared his macroeconomic insights on inflation, consumer debt, and precious metals, offering valuable guidance for investors navigating today’s economic complexities. ﻿ Greg Weldon highlighted how the current economic environment contrasts sharply with the 1980s. He explained that today’s high levels of debt fundamentally alter the U.S. economy’s ability to grow sustainably. He pointed out that the Federal Reserve’s decision to tolerate higher inflation, as outlined in Jerome Powell’s 2018 Jackson Hole speech, reflects the challenges of managing the debt burden. Weldon emphasized that the economic optimism following Trump’s election may falter as the reality of debt-driven constraints becomes clearer. Price & Buy Weldon raised alarms about consumer credit conditions, suggesting the U.S. may be approaching a financial tipping point. He pointed to declining savings and rising delinquencies as signs of severe strain on American households. These trends, Weldon noted, indicate that consumers are nearing their borrowing capacity, potentially triggering broader economic challenges. Weldon remains optimistic about the long-term potential of gold and silver. He sees central bank demand and limited speculative interest as key drivers for future growth in the metals market. Gold: Silver: Weldon emphasized that corrections in precious metals markets often provide buying opportunities for long-term investors. Price & Buy Weldon detailed several global risks shaping the economic landscape. Severe drought conditions in the U.S., geopolitical tensions, and inflationary pressures are creating a challenging environment for policymakers and investors alike. These dynamics, Weldon explained, will likely exacerbate inflation and push the Federal Reserve toward more aggressive interventions. Weldon offered a nuanced perspective on cryptocurrencies, recognizing their utility in combating currency devaluation while noting their speculative nature. He sees Bitcoin as distinct from gold, often behaving more like a risk asset tied to stock market movements. Weldon advised investors to balance crypto holdings with physical assets like gold and silver to mitigate risks. Price & Buy To navigate the current economic landscape, Weldon stressed the importance of blending macro and microeconomic analysis. He highlighted opportunities in mining shares and suggested using technical analysis to identify key entry points. Weldon encouraged investors to diversify across sectors and asset classes to hedge against economic uncertainties. Greg Weldon concluded by emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive investment strategy that combines macroeconomic insights, technical analysis, and sector-specific knowledge. For those interested in his research, Weldon offers detailed reports and managed account services. He can be reached at [email protected], and his podcast, Money Markets, and New Age Investing, is available on major platforms. During the Money Metals Podcast, Greg Weldon addressed a wide range of pressing economic topics, offering insights into inflation, consumer credit challenges, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies. Below are some of the key questions posed by host Mike Maharrey and Weldon’s in-depth answers, providing valuable perspectives for investors navigating today’s complex markets. The debt levels today are significantly higher, which fundamentally alters the economy’s ability to grow. Unlike the 1980s under Ronald Reagan, the U.S. no longer has the flexibility to manage inflation through high interest rates due to the massive debt burden. Greg Weldon projects gold prices to reach $4,900 within three years, driven by strong central bank demand and limited speculative interest. Corrections in gold prices offer buying opportunities. China’s increased demand for silver and its dual role as an industrial and monetary metal are critical. Silver’s technical breakout at $31.60 could signal a strong upward trend. Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset tied to stock market movements than as “digital gold.” While useful for protecting against currency devaluation in some countries, cryptocurrencies face risks like infrastructure disruptions. Diversification with physical assets like gold is advised. Weldon highlighted Canadian miners like Torex and Wheaton as strong candidates due to favorable technical setups and currency dynamics. Uranium stocks are also gaining momentum. Severe drought conditions in the U.S., rising food prices, geopolitical tensions, and inflation pose significant challenges. These factors could force the Federal Reserve to act more aggressively, affecting market dynamics. Weldon provides detailed reports like the Global Macro Strategy Report and The Gold Guru, along with managed account services. He can be contacted at [email protected] or through his podcast, Money Markets, and New Age Investing. People can purchase gold and silver at MoneyMetals.com. Source: Money Metals Become a Patron!

We already touched down this morning with our master roundup of the best Thanksgiving price drops, but there’s even more to come and some particular highlights we wanted to showcase. We have now have a new all-time low Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 7 with 12-core Snapdragon X Elite chip at over $400 off alongside a giant selection of other Snapdragon and Chromebook deals. Those offers join Google’s Black Friday price drop on Pixel 9 Pro XL that is now $100 less than advertised, a rare deal on Meta Quest 3 for Black Friday, the very first discount on the new supersized Echo Show 21 smart display, and the best price ever on the 2024 Samsung S24 FE from $450 shipped. But all that’s all just for starters, head below for a closer look at today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is now offering Microsoft’s 2024 Surface Laptop 7 Copilot+ PC at $999 shipped. That’s $401 less than its usual going rate of $1,400 and the lowest we have tracked for it so far. Today’s 29% offer drops this touchscreen Copilot+ PC with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD $100 below its previous all-time low, and it’s now only $100 more than its relatively less powerful sibling with the Snapdragon X Plus chip. The new Surface Laptop 7 is available in Platinum, Black, Dune, and Sapphire colorways, and they’re all down to the $999 low today. The same model, in case you’re wondering, is currently fetching $1,100 at Best Buy. Head below for more details. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: While the official Google Black Friday sale got off to an early start this year only to see Amazon and Best Buy get aggressive with even deeper deals, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has now dropped again. Google advertised and subsequently launched a $150 price drop on this model and now Amazon has it starting down at $849 shipped – Best Buy has since priced matched on this model as well. Regularly $1,099, this is a straight $250 price drop to deliver a new Amazon all-time low and the lowest we have tracked to date on Google’s latest XL-sized handset. Best Buy is currently offering a $75 gift card with Meta’s 512GB Quest 3 VR headset at $499.99 shipped as a part of its Black Friday Doorbuster deals. This particular headset dropped to the $499 mark after the Quest 3S debut in September. Today’s Black Friday deal essentially lands a $75 discount on it with a FREE gift card that can go towards your other purchases at Best Buy. Head below for more details. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. Update 11/28: Amazon has now price matched the Best Buy Doorbuster offer starting $449.99 shipped. Update 11/28: Best Buy’s next Doorbuster sale is now offering the new Samsung S24 FE from $449.99 shipped to deliver the lowest price we have tracked to date at $200 off the going rate – this deal is currently undercutting both Samsung and Amazon. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

Christmas Billy Binion, Fiona Harrigan, Jeff Luse, Kelvey Vander Hart, J.D. Tuccille, Adam Sullivan, Ian Keyser, Justin Zuckerman, Christian Britschgi, Adani Samat, Bekah Congdon, Zach Weissmueller, Jack Nicastro, Regan Taylor, Cody Huff, Eric Boehm, Katherine Mangu-Ward, Natalie Dowzicky, Danielle Thompson, Matthew Petti, Jason Russell, Emma Camp, Veronique de Rugy, Ronald Bailey, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Peter Suderman, Brian Doherty, César Báez, Hunt Beaty, Jacob Sullum, Bess Byers, and John Carter | 11.28.2024 10:32 AM Time is no longer real. (Was it ever?) Christmas decor is back—which seems to happen in some stores before Halloween, naturally—and you may be bracing your ears to hear "Last Christmas" by Wham! on repeat, as the universe apparently decided long ago that that should be the eternal holiday soundtrack. (It's a bop, if you ask me.) In any case, those festive changes also signal something else: It's time to go shopping for some presents. First off, for those in your life who enjoy ideas, politics, libertarianism, and/or reading actual physical pages—vintage!—you can give the gift of Reason. We offer three years of our magazine (that's 33 issues) for $37.97—a mere $1.15 a pop. Shoppers can also select two years (22 issues) for $25.97, and one year (11 issues) for $14.97. Who wouldn't want to develop a monthly ritual of reading a package of pieces that challenge conventional wisdom, like our December issue about how we should abolish everything? There's probably someone—many people?—in your life who'd look at you like you have 17 heads if you were to make that argument. Which is why you should give them Reason. We also have our trusty swag store with apparel for men, women, and even babies, as well as a very sturdy camper mug. My personal favorite is our Reason windbreaker (which, unfortunately, does not come in baby size yet). No need to be cold while you're repping or evangelizing. For a more diverse set of suggestions—from art to vice to games and maybe a little magic—Reason did as we always do: We polled our staff to help ease your shopping woes. Merry merry. —Billy Binion, reporter Politicians have been waging war against airline "junk fees": the extra charges travelers face for seat reservations, itinerary changes, or checked bags. You can help your loved ones do a little bit of that themselves—arguably more effectively—by buying them a set of packing cubes this holiday season. Stay with me here. Packing cubes are zippered pouches that come in a variety of sizes and nest into a suitcase. Each holds a different type of item, which helps travelers avoid overpacking and keeps garments organized. They're a surprisingly effective way to cram a full vacation's worth of clothing into a compact suitcase, making them a great purchase for anyone who would rather not deal with the hassle (and cost) of checking a bag. That means fewer fees and less stress, particularly for those friends who insist on flying Spirit Airlines. Traveling has never been easier thanks to innovations such as translation apps, rideshare services, downloadable offline maps, and, yes, packing cubes, which make getting to your destination a smoother and more affordable experience—no bureaucrats required. —Fiona Harrigan, deputy managing editor Buy Veken packing cubes for $16.98 Every year, millions of Americans flee suburbia and city life to visit beaches for summer vacation. I suspect many Reason subscribers visit my home—the Outer Banks in North Carolina—which sees its population spike from less than 40,000 in the winter to almost 300,000 per week in the summer. While libertarians may disagree on many things, we agree on at least one core fundamental: We love freedom. To me, there's no place freer than the beach, where people can forget about life's challenges and truly unwind. But since the summer months are, unfortunately, still a ways away, Christmas is the perfect time to give the thalassophile in your life a taste—or smell, rather—of what's to come. Gift a Sex Wax air freshener. This product—for a car, house, or office—will take you back to sandy beaches, slow-rolling waves, and piña coladas at sunset. Available in packs of three, they're a particularly apt stocking stuffer (especially the coconut scent, which is my favorite). And if you're in the market for a more wrappable gift, consider ordering some candles from local beach artisans. Your loved ones will cruise through winter surrounded by beachy fragrances, and you'll be supporting a local economy in the off-season. —Jeff Luse, deputy managing editor Buy Sex Wax air freshener for $9.98 Shop the Outer Banks Candle Company America's national parks are spectacular. They highlight the best of our country's landscapes, with views that look almost too beautiful to be real. The outdoorsy loved one in your life is almost certainly, or should be, a fan—even if they think the government should get out of the parks business. But despite the wealth of taxpayer funding the parks receive, visiting a federally-managed outdoor site is still pricey. "Didn't my taxes already pay for this?" your token libertarian friends or family members may find themselves asking at the gate, consumed by sticker shock. "User fees are the superior funding structure, yes. But both?" The solution: Get them an America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass. Technically, you'll still be handing the federal government money. But you can rest assured that the price for one of these annual passes is far lower than just a couple of gate fees in a given year. With the annual pass, your loved one can visit over 2,000 sites—including the iconic Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Acadia national parks, oh my!—without paying entrance fees. Better yet, they can bring friends in the same vehicle, and the pass usually covers those entrance fees, too. Take that, government! —Kelvey Vander Hart, communications specialist Buy an America the Beautiful National Parks Pass for $80 I was recently replacing a dry-rotted trim board on the exterior of my house. As I held the new board in place, screws ready to go into the pilot holes, I realized I'd neglected to bring a screwdriver up the ladder with me. Fortunately, I had a multitool on my belt and it was good enough for the job. That's the way it usually goes with multitools: They're almost never the best tool for the job. But when they're the only tool in reach, or you want to tote something just in case, they're good enough. For years I've carried a Leatherman Rebar and a Micra. But last year I gave my son a Wave+ as an off-to-college present. While a full toolbox would have been a bit much for his dorm room, his Wave+ has proven itself to be up to shelf assembly and the tasks that university maintenance occasionally neglects. It would probably work for you, too, when you're far from your tools—like, say, when you're up a ladder. —J.D. Tuccille, contributing editor Buy the Wave+ for $95.96 Do you have a home improvement novice in your life? Or perhaps you live with someone you want to subtly nudge in that direction? When I started buying power tools, it was hard to decide what to get first. So many tools. So many different jobs. Where does one begin? Let me suggest that a reciprocating saw is a great gateway drug. Commonly known under the umbrella term Sawzall, there are many good reciprocating saws on the market. I buy RYOBI tools because they're relatively cheap but good enough for small projects. Plus, I already have the batteries. (Once you buy one cordless power tool, you're locked into the brand for life. The more you know.) A reciprocating saw may not be a precision tool, but it's great for light demolition, renovation, and outdoor work—a.k.a. the starter projects. Mine paid for itself in the money I saved on tree service expenses the first time I used it to take down some branches. This tool is a great middle ground for a certain type of libertarian do-it-yourself enthusiast: those who want some of the self-reliance capitalism provides through affordable tools but are also glad to enjoy the fruits of labor specialization by outsourcing for the bigger projects. —Adam Sullivan, digital marketing specialist Buy the RYOBI One+ Cordless Reciprocating Saw for $53.95 I'm quite certain many of our readers know a guy who luxuriates in the simple pleasure of carrying an entire handbag's worth of things in the pockets of a pair of cargo pants. Certainly everyone I know does because I, myself, am that guy. The problem: Cargo attire is an assault on the eyes. Enter the LA Police Gear (LAPG) Terrain Flex Jeans, a "tactical" option that will give the recipient the gloriously masculine experience without the fashion faux pas that is a pair of cargo pants. The LAPG features a total of eight pockets, two of which are just the right size for standard capacity AR magazines (though I use them for my phone and flashlight/leatherman). For the last few months, I've worn a pair just about every day while still carrying everything I did in my cargo pants—and even more comfortably. Also available in a slim fit. Cargo pants could never. —Ian Keyser, audio engineer Buy LAPG Men's Terrain Flex Tactical Jeans for $39.99-$49.99 If you're shopping for someone who may not have the patience to sit for eons and learn the rules of a complex and intricate board game—Risk, anyone?—Pass the Pigs offers players the thrill and ease of a casino game, with the cuteness of miniature farm animals. What a deal. The game is simple: You roll the pigs and see what body position they land in. Each position—Siders, Trotters, Razorbacks, Snouters, or the big kahuna, Leaning Jowler, where the pig lands on its snout—is worth a certain number of points. The first player to 100 wins. But be careful! The more times you roll in a single turn, the more likely you'll land in a "pig out," which will see you lose all your points. This is a game that allows players to control their destinies—but with plenty of risk and luck involved, too. It's up to you whether you let it ride or play more conservatively. Whoever gets this gift will be in hog heaven. —Justin Zuckerman, producer Buy Pass the Pigs for $14.49 For those eager to avoid some very unmerry partisan snipping with relatives on the other side of the political spectrum this year, you can't do better than by playing a game that treats everything like it's on a spectrum. Wavelength, from CMYK Games, is a family-friendly contest to see who is the best mind reader—and who knows you the best. To start, a player draws a random card with a spectrum written on it: science fiction vs. fantasy, tasty vs. gross, fun vs. boring, etc. They then randomly adjust a speedometerlike dial to a point between the two ends of that spectrum and give their fellow teammates a clue to see if they can correctly guess where the dial landed. It's much easier than it sounds. For example, if you're an outspoken libertarian who draws the card "coercive vs. voluntary," and the dial is set all the way to coercive, you might give "the state" as a clue. If your teammates know you well—and libertarianism well—they'll know the state is as coercive as it gets, guess accordingly, and get all the points possible. If they whiff, they'll miss the points, and you'll know they missed the point of last year's gift: a hardback copy of Anarchy, State, and Utopia. As with any good game of social deduction, the joy of Wavelength comes less from scoring points and moving pieces and more from seeing just how well you know your friends and family and how well they know you. So if you're trying to maintain good and joyous relations with your family during this polarizing Christmas season, gift the game that encourages everyone to be on the same wavelength. —Christian Britschgi, reporter Buy Wavelength for $29.99 I'm usually skeptical about skin care products. My attitude toward this market changed a bit, however, when I discovered Magic Molecule. This hypochlorous acid spray—marketed as an antidote for a slew of skin ailments—lives up to its supernatural name. I whip it out anytime I have a cut on my finger or the occasional oil splatter from cooking. The "magic" moment comes when you realize that your skin wounds not only feel and look better after a couple of hours but have recovered almost entirely by the next day. The company also claims the product promotes healing for eczema, acne, sunburns, rashes, and more. Imagine someone's reaction a mere century or two ago if they were to see what science and the market would come together to provide. Sure, it won't turn you into Wolverine and make you completely invincible this festive season, particularly while you're furiously cooking around the stove. But this is an excellent gift for your friends and family, and may even convert the male skin care skeptic in your life. Practically magic. —Adani Samat, video art director Buy Magic Molecule for $32 For those intrigued by the mind-changing potential of a psychedelic experience, the Shrüm All-in-One Grow Bag from Advanced Mycology offers an easy, approachable way to start a new mushroom-fueled journey. The hassle of tubs, tents, and sterile labs can intimidate any budding mycologist, but this product provides an easy, low-maintenance way to explore a new hobby and cultivate curiosity—no extra space or Ph.D. needed. The bag comes prepped and ready to be injected with liquid culture or spores. It's designed specifically for cubensis mushrooms—otherwise known as magic mushrooms (though legally speaking, this is only a research or novelty product). Couple the Grow Bag with Shrüm Liquid Culture, which comes loaded up with your choice from a trippy menu of varietals such as Albino Penis Envy, Steel Magnolia, and White Jedi Mind Fuck. Shrüm also recently partnered with Mike Tyson on its new MIKEADELICS Mushroom Grow Bag, if you're looking for a heavyweight experience. If you know someone discouraged by the outcome of several drug policy ballot initiatives in the 2024 election, this unique gift can assuage that disappointment. Just read the FAQs on the website and make sure to double-check local laws before getting started. The Shrüm Liquid Culture contains only early-stage mycelium (no psilocybin is present) so what arrives on your doorstep isn't illegal in any state or federally. But since psilocybin develops during the growth process, your journey—or trip, shall we say—may quickly turn illegal, depending on where you live. —Bekah Congdon, deputy managing editor Buy the Shrüm All-in-One Grow Bag for $25 Until lawmakers unshackle the biohackers to eradicate annoying, disease-carrying mosquitoes once and for all, it seems we're stuck coping with itchy bug bites and the scars they can leave behind. As a Florida Man who doesn't love dousing himself with insect repellent just to enjoy a short wooded trail hike or to paddle a stream, I was pleased to discover that capitalism has generated a more elegant solution to the vampiric insect problem: Destroy the bite with heat. The German medical device company Beuerer created the BR60 Insect Bite Healer. It delivers a three-to-six second pulse of 122-degree Fahrenheit heat, which is sufficient to break down the proteins—histamines, tryptase, leukotrienes—present in many insect toxins and salivas. No toxic proteins means no itchiness and swelling. I'll be honest: This is not the most pleasant six seconds you'll ever experience, but no pain, no gain. My family can attest that this remarkable, simple device really works to make mosquito and gnat bites stop itching, like magic—momentarily painful magic, but magic just the same. We haven't (thankfully) yet had a reason to try it on a bee or wasp sting, but reviewers report it's fairly effective there, too. I'm still holding out hope for total mosquito armageddon in my lifetime given promising early results. But until then, I'll be keeping my magical German bug saliva protein-destroyer handy. —Zach Weissmueller, senior producer Buy Beurer Insect Sting and Bite Relief for $23.99 When gift giving, it's not dollar value that matters but sentimental value. (I'll keep telling myself that since I'm a recent college graduate with little discretionary income.) Speaking also as someone who's occupied a lifelong spot on Santa's nice list—just like all Reason readers, I'm sure—I want to show my loved ones that I care. There's no better way to do this than with art. Procure a piece of artwork that reflects their tastes, values, and aesthetic sensibility. One way to do this is to make it yourself. If you go this route, you can rest assured they'll say they love it because you made it with your blood, sweat, and tears, no matter how janky it inevitably looks. Yet if the extent of your artistic expertise begins and ends with finger painting, then you should probably forgo making art yourself. Instead, take them to a museum and determine their favorite work—subtly or otherwise—and record the title and author. The rest is easy: Access a high-resolution photo of the piece, which is usually available on the museum's website; download it (or take a high-resolution screenshot); visit Staples custom poster printing online; upload the image; and choose 7.9 mil semi-gloss photo paper. Pick up the masterpiece from the nearest brick-and-mortar location, frame it, and voilà, you've got yourself a meaningful gift that doesn't leave you penniless. —Jack Nicastro, assistant editor Shop Staples prints We all have that BFF or family member whose walls are tragically plain. Whether we're renting, owning, or squatting, it's a massive mental boost to personalize your corner of this crazy world. This holiday season, you can help your loved ones do just that, courtesy of TaudalpoiDesigns. Taudalpoi is a Norwegian digital artist whose work consists of "retro-futuristic, vintage and surreal collage art." There's something for the young, the old, and the in-between: The work often marries a 1950s-esque aesthetic with futuristic themes, like this piece—which goes for $18 but as of this writing is just $12.60—depicting vintage cars parked on the moon. (Hey, maybe one day.) It's a celebration of how far we've come, and how far we still have to go—"a blend of eras," the artist writes, and "a journey through time and imagination." Just a few decades ago, buying art was mostly limited to attending shows and fairs. In 2024, distinctive artists like Taudalpoi are just a click away on Etsy, and for an incredibly reasonable price. Mosey on over and snag something original for your people. —Regan Taylor, video editor Shop Taudalpoi Designs If you're shopping for an amateur culinary artist but don't won't drain your bank account, consider the Tensyu kitchen knife. I won't pretend these knives are amazing. They're mass-produced somewhere in Japan as cheaply as humanly possible—perhaps from the leftover bits of steel used to make higher-quality knives. That's its selling point, though. Because just as every kitchen should have a set of premium knives, every kitchen should also have some trusty beater knives to rely on when you need a hardy backup. And the Tensyu kitchen knife is a solid, inexpensive backup. Tensyu offers six knife types, ranging from the classic santoku to the small but versatile petty knife. Each instrument is constructed with a stainless steel blade attached firmly to an ergonomic handle available in either wood or plastic. I own three of these knives, and each one has maintained a sharp edge with minimal maintenance. The downside is that I've only seen them available in-store at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. So to purchase one you have to temporarily eschew the wonders of shopping from your couch and do it the old-fashioned way: by leaving your home and driving to a brick-and-mortar store. And if the low price point is what's most enticing to you here, you better act fast. These aren't made in the U.S., so someone might slap a tariff on them soon. —Cody Huff, post-production supervisor Find your nearest T.J. Maxx Belgian painter René Magritte's The Empire of Light—a gorgeous surrealist work juxtaposing a nocturnal streetscape below a bright blue daytime sky—sold for more than $121 million at a Christie's auction in mid-November. The sale made Magritte the 16th artist to have a work sell for over nine figures and signals that the market is finally recognizing his brilliance. You probably don't have that kind of cash on hand for a holiday gift, but thankfully the market provides more affordable alternatives too. The online shop for the Magritte Museum in Brussels offers a wide variety of excellent gift options. A framed print of The Empire of Light can be yours for just €20, plus shipping—quite the bang for the buck when considering it is 99.99 percent below the auction price. Or grab a coffee mug bearing the likeness of The Treachery of Images, probably Magritte's most well-known work: a painting of a pipe above the written phrase "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" ("This is not a pipe"). Get it? It makes sense that surrealism would be enjoying a bit of a moment right now in these topsy-turvy times. Gift accordingly. —Eric Boehm, reporter Shop the Magitte Museum Listen, I know fancy new Apple AirPods are pretty spendy at $249, but hear me out on a specific use case. Are there older people in your life who can't hear but don't think they need hearing aids? It's a tale as old as time. Get them the new AirPods Pro 2. On Christmas morning, it will seem like a cool tech gift. But you'll know that it's actually a stealth medical device. Thanks to the deregulation of over-the-counter hearing aids, Apple can more safely lean into the market and now touts "clinical grade Hearing Aid capability" for its latest in-ear headphones, with a free software upgrade. As Apple notes: "Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are regulated health features and will be offered after authorization is received," but thankfully the U.S. is listed as an approved region. At the very least, the recipient will enjoy cool, super tiny speakers of better quality than they've probably ever experienced. And thanks to deregulation and globalization, maybe grandpa will be able to hear the kids' squeals of joy next Christmas, too. —Katherine Mangu-Ward, editor in chief Buy the AirPods Pro 2 for $249 After 16 years, 175,000 miles, and two tow trips, my 2008 Toyota RAV4 had seen better days. (May it rest in peace.) A creature of habit, I went to the local Toyota dealership to get the updated model—but was shocked by the price tag ($60,000!). So I decided to look elsewhere. To my surprise, I ended up in a Tesla showroom. I wouldn't say I'm an Elon Musk fangirl. But in my search, I found that Teslas have superior safety technology compared with other options on the market—and for a more affordable price. (It's also fun that my new toy can park itself and be summoned at the push of a button.) At the end of the day, I spent about $48,000—I went with the Model Y—to buy a car that won't be outdated anytime soon; meanwhile, I've already saved hundreds of dollars that I would have spent on gas, and the electrical vehicle tax rebate offers additional money in my pocket. The latter is a dumb perk, to be sure, but we already pay the government too much money. May as well get some back where you can. Gifting a car is obviously a big commitment, so this idea is probably limited to, say, spouses and children. But it's the perfect surprise for the loved one in your life who appreciates the power of innovation—remember when a fully electric vehicle sounded like something from a science fiction novel?—and who needs a stylish new ride. Full speed ahead. —Natalie Dowzicky, managing editor of video and podcasts Shop Tesla In the wake of spicy school board showdowns and pandemic-era remote learning, homeschooling is on the rise. So it stands to reason that you may have a homeschooler or two on your gift list. If that's the case, a Little Passports subscription box makes the perfect gift for homeschooled kiddos—or any kid who loves to learn outside of traditional state-regulated structures. With varied offerings for ages three to 10, these monthly boxes contain fun and educational projects, chapter books, and activities that cover a lot of territory to correspond with your child's interests. Theme options include: Science Expeditions, World Adventures, Space Quest, Craft Discovery, and more. You can gift a subscription for six months, 12 months, or a month at a time. My little one isn't quite school age, but my husband and I—both of us homeschool veterans of the 1990s—plan to teach her at home. So I've been on the lookout for innovative ways to foster a love of learning from an early age, and I can't wait to try Little Passports. Kids will enjoy a new surprise waiting for them in the mailbox every month. But this gift isn't just for them, as homeschooling moms and dads will definitely appreciate an activity—ahem, learning module—that they don't have to plan. —Danielle Thompson, senior video editor Shop Little Passports Kids like to ask a lot of tough questions. "What if you drained all the water out of the oceans? Or put a submarine in outer space? What if you turned off the sun? Or took all the DNA out of a person?" Suffice to say those queries are difficult for a layman to address. Thankfully cartoonist and former NASA engineer Randall Munroe has the answers that parents are looking for with the latest book in his What If? series—the 10th Anniversary Edition—which offers "serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions." But this book is not just for inquisitive children and their parents. Although the explanations are easy to digest, they're not condescending. Munroe walks readers through exactly how they would go about finding the answers to these hypotheticals, as well as the real connections they have to science. For precocious kids and free-thinking adults alike, What If? 10th Anniversary Edition is a reminder that there are no stupid questions—and that human imagination need not be limited by the laws of nature or how many trips you've taken around the sun. —Matthew Petti, assistant editor Buy What If? 10th Anniversary Edition for $27.16 If a real-life Grinch gets his way, there are going to be fewer toys under the tree in 2025. President-elect Donald Trump is considering tariff policies that will raise the prices of many products, but toys will be among the hardest hit. The National Retail Federation analyzed two possible tariff hikes. Under one, "a universal tariff of 10% or even 20% on all imports into the United States from all countries," consumer prices on toys would rise 36.3 percent. Under the other, "an additional tariff of 60% or even 100% on all imports from China on top of existing tariffs," toy prices rise 55.8 percent. With price hikes like that affecting the whole economy, Trump is arguably worse than the Grinch. The Grinch learned the error of his ways in the end. Will Trump? We can't count on it. So before likely tariff hikes raise prices next year, it's a great time to buy toys from the Chinese company VTech. Some of their toys are branded with popular kids shows like Bluey, CoComelon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. None of those shows are perfectly libertarian—let's pump the brakes on the cartoon police state, shall we?—but we live in a society. For a more libertarian toy, try their Jiggle and Giggle Fishing Set—teach a child to fish, and they can feed themselves for the rest of their lives without having to worry about food tariffs, agriculture subsidies, or regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (though annual state fishing licenses seem like a scam). The Smart Wheels Train Station Playset might be nice at teaching them early on that trains are for transporting cargo, not long-haul intercity passenger routes. As for me, I'll be getting my son the Smart Shots Sports Center. Maybe it will instill in him a belief that competition makes us all better off. Or maybe he'll spend months teething on the little soccer ball. Who can say? —Jason Russell, managing editor Shop VTech While the college culture war seems never-ending, there's one thing that may unite students from a slew of American universities, no matter where those institutions happen to fall on the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) free speech rankings: Kyle Cavan's college architecture–inspired necklaces and earrings. Cavan's line of jewelry, based on intricate reproductions of iconic campus landmarks, makes the perfect gift for the college student in your life—or anyone else who basks in the glory of their college days a tad too much. These chic necklaces and earrings offer an understated way to flaunt your college pride, consistently trumping the kitschy logo-laden offerings in most university bookstores. They're subtle and sophisticated enough to feel at home in the quad of a New England liberal arts college and on Bama RushTok. His little pieces of swag cover a wide range of big schools, from Auburn to Villanova, though you probably won't find an option for smaller universities. My own necklace of the University of Virginia rotunda constantly attracts compliments both from fellow UVA alumni and people who are just fond of Mr. Jefferson's University, which recently took the top spot in FIRE's rankings. Free speech, but make it fashion. —Emma Camp, associate editor Shop Kyle Cavan Looking for the perfect gift for your favorite freedom lover who spends way too much time sitting and tweeting about abolishing the Fed? As a libertarian who's learned the hard way that the invisible hand doesn't prevent blood clots, let me suggest something unexpectedly practical: Vim & Vigor compression socks. I know, I know—compression socks sound about as exciting as a lecture by a Keynesian on the high value of a spending multiplier. But hear me out, fellow liberty enthusiasts: These aren't your grandmother's medical stockings that scream "I've given up on life and fashion simultaneously." These bad boys come in stylish and sometimes zany patterns that your loved one can don to express their individuality. (They don't yet come in cryptocurrency motifs, but a girl can dream.) Practical and fashionable. Unlike government programs, they deliver what they promise. Plus, nothing says "personal responsibility" quite like preventing a pulmonary embolism. —Veronique de Rugy, contributing editor Shop Vim & Vigor Chances are many readers are at least somewhat familiar with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the iconic novel by Mark Twain. James, the new National Book Award–winning bestselling book by Percival Everett, is a sharp reworking of that classic tale from the point of view of Huck's friend, the escaped enslaved man Jim. A modern counterpart to Twain's, Everett's engrossing novel reexamines themes of liberty, race, conscience, and friendship through a contemporary, often satirical lens, 140 years after the original was published. This journey of self-emancipation will be enjoyed by all the lovers of liberty on your Christmas gift list. —Ronald Bailey, science correspondent Buy James for $28 Have a bookworm on your list who's seemingly read everything? If so, you can't go wrong with something from Melville House, an independent publisher that puts out beautiful but nonfussy and affordable works that offer something new even for the most voracious reader. I'm especially a fan of Melville's Neversink, Last Interview, and Art of the Novella series. The Neversink line focuses on "books from around the world that have been overlooked, under appreciated, looked askance at, or foolishly ignored," including literature and nonfiction. Think a 1958 "masterpiece of psychological suspense and a probing account of the decline of power" (The President) from French mystery master Georges Simenon; a now-forgotten 1902 memoir (I Await the Devil's Coming) that propelled 19-year-old author, Mary MacLane—the "Wild Woman of Butte"—to celebrity when it was published; surrealist Mina Loy's novel "about an impossible friendship amid the glamorous artistic bohemia of 1930s Paris" (Insel, unpublished during Loy's lifetime); or a 1937 novel "set among the dusty lanes and rolling valleys of rural 1930s Belgium" (La Femme de Gilles) from feminist writer and Nazi resister Madeleine Bourdouxhe. For the people-person, books in the Last Interview series each feature a curated collection of interviews—including the last known interview—with a different dead public figure (writers, actors, political figures, musicians, and more). There are now 41 books in this line, with subjects as diverse as Kurt Vonnegut, Hannah Arendt, Ernest Hemingway, Lou Reed, Anthony Bourdain, Ursula K. Le Guin, Billie Holiday, Joan Didion, Kurt Cobain, and bell hooks. Meanwhile, the Art of the Novella series includes 58 works of "this renegade art form"—some never previously printed in book form—including not-so-well-known novellas by well-known writers like Mary Shelley, Mark Twain, Anton Chekhov, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Charles Baudelaire, and Virginia Woolf. The thread tying together all of these series seems to be an appreciation for the great wealth and diversity of creative and intellectual products hidden in recent history and a dedication to preserving these endeavors for our current era. There's something here for all sorts of readers but especially those who like to uncover hidden gems from another culture or an earlier time. —Elizabeth Nolan Brown, senior editor Shop Melville House An aging empire cracking at its foundation. An elite political class out of touch with its citizens. Epic fights over energy and the fuel that powers civilization. A cult of political personality, and a demagogue eager to exploit it. No, I'm not describing America and the 2024 election. I'm talking about a desert planet called Arakis and the intergalactic battle over its most precious resource, spice, in the second part of director Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi classic, Dune. Villeneuve's big-screen adaptation split the first book of Herbert's series into two parts (there's a third on the way), with the second telling the story of a young man's quest to take revenge on an emperor who killed his father and stripped his family of power. Herbert's 1965 novel was a sort of environmentalist epic with an undercurrent of concern about the abuse of technology and political power. Villeneuve's movie version turns that undercurrent into a major theme, playing up the story's warnings about cults of political personality. Like Villeneuve's previous science fiction projects—Arrival, Blade Runner 2049—Dune Part Two is a triumph of big-screen, big-budget filmmaking. The 4K Ultra disc presents the movie's stark, shadowy images in gorgeously crunchy high contrast, and gives the movie's rousing score a pulsing clarity—creating an experience that rivals a movie theater from the comfort of your home. It's big. It's loud. It's a warning. It's a great movie. —Peter Suderman, features editor Buy Dune: Part Two 4K Ultra HD for $12.99 The freewheeling freedom of American culture offers a seemingly limitless supply of options for people seeking fellowship and understanding; a chance to experiment creatively or participate in unique experiences; or just a place in the world that feels like theirs. Comedian Moshe Kasher has been placed or chosen to embed himself in at least six of America's distinct subcultures, whose joys and annoyances he writes about in Subculture Vulture: A Memoir in Six Scenes with a clear, acidic, and funny eye that neither forgets what these specific worlds have given him nor ignores what can be troublesome or silly about them. Some of the subcultures he found himself in by birth—"The Jews" and "Deafness" as he calls them (both his parents are deaf, though he is not)—and some by choice (raves, Burning Man). Another one is his career—comedy—and one is his attempt to cope with the results of other bad choices: Alcoholics Anonymous. For all of them, Kasher provides an educated history of the cultures deftly and hilariously, buttressed by his personal experiences. If you know anyone contemplating lifestyle choices that will make some of these subcultures relevant, Kasher's book might provide either encouragement or a hefty dose of scared straight. He regrets that the internet changed the cultural dynamics that he moved in in the 1990s and early 21st century, which he thinks were vital to creating such a rich variety of scenes to move through. But the vast variety of unique ways to define one's identity is a core part of America that will almost certainly survive the web age. —Brian Doherty, senior editor Buy Subculture Vulture: A Memoir in Six Scenes for $21.30 Christmas gifts are the warm-up act for New Year's resolutions no one keeps. So what better than a notebook to jot down all those goals you'll guilt-read at the end of the year? Or maybe—just maybe—this upcoming year will be different. I know, I know, you've heard that refrain before. But consider that the classic 365-page planners set people up to fail when folks inevitably forget to write something during the first week of January. Instead, try the more forgiving 251-page notebook from LEUCHTTURM1917. Its lineup offers plenty of options, but I highly recommend dotted paper. If you or your loved one are highly visual people, lined pages feel like a prison. There's nothing better than the freedom to create your layouts, write, or draw (but not too much freedom—we don't want blank pages staring back at you, making it impossible to know where to begin). This product also comes with several perforated sheets for easy removal, as well as stickers for archiving. This holiday season, you don't have to break the bank to gift some self-improvement—priceless—whether you're shopping for a stoic bro or a tortured poet. —Cesar Baez, producer Buy the LEUCHTTURM1917 Medium Notebook for $24.69 We've all heard a variation of that cliche: It's not the gift but the thought that counts. This time, it's not the gift but the paper it's wrapped in. Consider covering that waffle maker or whatever forlorn kitchen appliance you're giving your aunt in this elegant bitcoin wrapping paper. Consider covering that waffle maker or whatever forlorn kitchen appliance you're giving your aunt in this elegant bitcoin wrapping paper. If the recipient hits you with the classic, "This wrapping paper is so pretty. I almost don't want to unwrap it!" then you have your perfect opening to give your crypto elevator speech. And if the recipient doesn't compliment the wrapping paper, then, well, you know it's high time to show them the light about the O.G. peer-to-peer, permissionless digital currency. Fresh off a milestone year that saw the asset's price reach all-time highs—and saw the Securities and Exchange Commission approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds—bitcoin is in some sense just getting started. I can't vouch for the wrapping paper's quality. But should it turn out to not be worth the paper it's printed on—much like fiat currency—don't fret. Because the paper itself isn't the point; the conversation is. And if you succeed in getting Aunt Betty to acquire a few satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin cryptocurrency, perhaps she'll be the one evangelizing this time next year. After all, who needs a new waffle iron if we're finally going to the moon? —Hunt Beaty, podcast producer Buy Bitcoin wrapping paper for $5.28 My records show that I bought the Vintorio Wine Aerator Pourer five times, so I must have really liked it. I did! It was a handy, highly portable way to accomplish something that used to require a decanter, other cumbersome equipment, or a lot of pretentious swirling. And it was cheap: just 18 bucks from Amazon. But it was also cheap in another way: It featured little plastic taps that were crucial to maintaining its integrity but tended to break off when you dropped it on a hard floor. Apparently, I did that repeatedly. (Mind you, this would have been prior to any imbibing, so it reflects my completely unintoxicated clumsiness.) I finally wised up and sprang for the more expensive but much sturdier TRIbella Classic Wine Aerator, which originally cost $40 but is currently going for $32 on Amazon. This aerator consists of three stainless steel tubes embedded in hard plastic surrounded by rubber that allows it to fit snugly in the neck of a wine bottle. At the bottom is another longer and thinner tube through which the wine flows into the aerator, and the shell has an opening that lets air in as you pour. The resulting three-stream emission is both aesthetically pleasing and highly efficient at mingling the wine with the air. Does it even matter? I think it does, although I confess that I have never done a blind taste test. This is probably not a gift for someone who needs to be convinced that aeration makes wine taste better, but it is an excellent choice for friends or relatives who already believe that and would welcome an easier way to accomplish the transformation—especially if they're accident-prone even when stone-cold sober. —Jacob Sullum, senior editor Buy the TRIbella Classic Wine Aerator for $31.99 In college, we used to smoke cannabis by taking knife hits—where you extract smoke by pressing flower between two heated knives—into frosty mugs. Then we'd sit back and sip the smoke. It seemed like an economical way to get lit and always made for great photos. Thankfully my DIY college era is over (which is convenient, as I burned through my butter knives). But the memory lives on with Zenco Duo. The Zenco Duo vaporizer is a new way to elevate your social session. It works with 510 thread cartridges, dry herbs, and concentrates—so there's something for everyone. There are four adjustable heat settings; you simply press the button and the glass attachment fills with smoke for quick, smooth hits. (Much more high-tech than my days at school.) The Zenco Duo also comes with two glass attachments, a concentrate scoop, a USB charger, and the cleaning essentials. But my favorite part is the glassware you can buy to complement your Duo. Their coffee mug pairs well with a morning smoke, the flow is filled with water for more filtration, and the sommelier glass is perfect for my kind of "wine" night. So now when someone asks if I want to grab drinks, I bring my Zenco Duo and skip the hangover. Cheers. —Bess Byers, digital marketing specialist Buy the Zenco Duo for $249 In a country where the joy of junk food is allegedly under threat from the incoming secretary of health and human services, I have the secret weapon gift for your loved ones who savor a good snack. A Costco membership. As additional health regulations loom, stockpiling your favorite goodies may become a strategic necessity. Someone may want to hoard their gummy bears, made of colorful dyes and that sweet, sweet high-fructose corn syrup. A membership at Costco will put people one step ahead of the flavor police, ensuring access to a steady supply of guilty pleasures at low, low prices. And let's not forget about dental hygiene. Because after savoring those salty and sugary delights, you'll need a strong defense against cavities. Stock up on your fluoride rinse before it's eliminated from the water supply. Give the gift of delicious defiance—and a side of dental hygiene—with a Costco membership, the ultimate middle finger to the nutrition nanny-staters. —John Carter, producer Buy a Costco membership for $65-130 per year The Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille. If you care about government overreach and tangible threats to everyday liberty, this is for you.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks. Power needs for artificial intelligence and cloud computing are expanding so rapidly that some data center campuses may use more electricity than entire cities, or even states, CNBC reports. Here is what Ali Fenn, president of Lancium, a company that secures land and power for data centers had to say about technology companies: "Technology companies are in a “race of a lifetime to global dominance” in artificial intelligence. It’s frankly about national security and economic security. They’re going to keep spending because there’s no more profitable place to deploy capital”. READ NOW: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News As such, it is important to note that renewable energy isn’t going to be enough to meet their power needs. According to developers, natural gas will also have to play a role. In turn, this need will slow down the progress towards meeting carbon dioxide emission targets. Nat Sahlstrom, chief energy officer at Tract, a Denver-based company that secures land, infrastructure, and power resources for such facilities, further reveals how data center companies have already begun operating at a scale where they have started “tapping out against the existing utility infrastructure”. In other news, Uber is reportedly building a fleet of gig workers for labeling data for AI models. The new data labeling division, known as Scaled Solutions, will have workers complete projects for the company's internal business units as well as serve outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic, according to a report from Bloomberg. The ride-hailing company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the U.S., Canada, and India, among others. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A group of software engineers working in an open, futuristic office. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47 On November 25, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC), known as the search-focused AI company, announced that it is expanding its partnership with Amazon Web Services. The expanded partnership will leverage AWS’s latest generative artificial intelligence (AI) services. Through the collaboration, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) will be offering large language model (LLM) observability support for Amazon Bedrock in Elastic Observability. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that builds generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) will be able to track insights into their Amazon Bedrock LLMs performance and usage; helping prevent issues and improve performance for their Amazon Bedrock-powered generative AI applications. Moreover, Elastic's AI Assistant, which is also powered by Amazon Bedrock, will offer insights, visualizations, and recommendations to help SREs solve problems. “As LLM-based applications are growing, it’s essential for developers and SREs to be able to monitor, optimize, and troubleshoot how they perform. Today’s integration simplifies the collection of metrics and logs from Amazon Bedrock, in turn streamlining the process of gaining valuable and actionable insights.” Overall ESTC ranks 11th on our list of the buzzing AI stocks that are making headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of ESTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ESTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Pantera Capital’s Bitcoin Fund Achieves 131,000% Lifetime Return
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/11/pantera-capitals-bitcoin-fund-achieves-131000-lifetime-return/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T15:16:00Z
Full Content:
Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has revealed in a new post that its Patnera Bitcoin Fund’s lifetime return has recently topped 131,000% net of fees and expenses after the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged to near $100,000 after the US elections. In the post, Pantera Capital’s CEO Dan Morehead shared an email forecasting back in July 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at $65, that the “bitcoin washout happened” and predicting the price of the cryptocurrency would surge over time. The email notes he was going to “buy 30,000 bitcoins” with his own personal money at a time in which the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization was around $740 million. Given the small size of the cryptocurrency market at the time, Morehead noted that in 2013-15, the fund “bought 2% of the world’s bitcoins.” To Morehead, buying Bitcoin at the time was like “buying gold in 1000 B.C.” as then “99% of the financial wealth has yet to address bitcoin.” He noted that the industry has made progress and now believes 95% of the financial wealth “has yet to put their full-sized position on.” The CEO added that the catalyst for the figure to keep on dropping has “just happened: regulatory clarity in the United States” at a time in which massive “institutional managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others are now offering incredibly cheap, efficient access to anyone with a brokerage account. “ As a result, he predicted the price of Bitcoin will move to $740,000 per coin, up from its current level around $95,000. The surge would see Bitcoin’s total market capitalization hit $15 trillion, which to Morehead isn’t an inconceivable number relative to the $500 trillion in financial assets. Per his words if Bitcoin’s price growth were to continue it would hit the $740,000 mark in April 2028. Featured image via Unsplash.

Title: The S&P 500 will climb 10% to 6,600 next year as earnings and the economy stay strong, Barclays says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-index-target-us-economy-consumer-barclays-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-28T13:45:01Z
Full Content:
The S&P 500 is primed to continue its bull rally in 2025, though at a slightly slower pace, Barclays strategists said in an outlook published this week. The strategists, led by the firm's head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna, predict the index will climb another 10% to 6,600 next year, propelled by strong tech earnings growth and a resilient economy. Their forecast marks a slowdown index's 26% gain so far this year, but they're bullish that the economic environment will continue to prop up the stock market. "Macro slowing to still-healthy levels should support more US equity upside next year, albeit a deceleration from '23-'24's breakneck pace. Positioning looks constructive, and policy uncertainty creates room for stock and sector selection," the analysts said in a Monday note. Much of their optimism lies in the robust US economy, which remains strong as consumers—the "central pillar" of the US economy and stock market—enjoy income gains and continue to open their wallets, they said. "The US economy remains resilient thanks to the still-intact 'virtuous cycle' between rising aggregate incomes and consumption," the analysts wrote. "Concerns around household financial distress appear overblown; overall delinquency rates remain low and borrowers, as a whole, are burdened with less consumer and revolving credit, as a percentage of income, than prior to the pandemic," they added. They also point to strong earnings growth potential for Big Tech stocks, which they say Wall Street is likely underestimating by 12%. They acknowledge, though, that there are some risks stemming from companies' massive AI investments and investors' eagerness to soon see a return. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows that tech giants like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have already invested hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure and are poised to spend another $200 billion next year. The analysts say inflation also poses a risk, especially if President-elect Donald Trump implements his proposals for sweeping tariffs and a crackdown on immigration, both of which would drive up prices through 2026, the analysts say. That could prompt fewer rate cuts from the Federal Reserve than markets are expecting, adding a hurdle for stocks, they added. "The risk to equities is not insignificant, especially since Treasury yields are up sharply since September and are approaching levels at which they've historically been a headwind for equities, which could be problematic in the event of fiscal expansion and fewer rate cuts," the analysts said. They added, though, that the policy roadmap remains uncertain and markets have typically weathered inflation and rates well in recent years. Barclays joins other big banks in forecasting continued gains in 2025, and the mood is decidedly bullish even as policy and geopolitical headwinds swirl. RBC analysts predicted the S&P 500 will hit 6,600 points on Monday, while strategists at Deutsche Bank set a target of 7,000. Last week, analysts at BMO said the index will hit 6,700 next year.

WIRED's Black Friday 2024 Coverage Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and the near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata This Panasonic 4K Blu-Ray player supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, which makes it fully optimized for getting the most out of your discs. I like how simple and easy to use these players are, although they do have software that feels a bit like it was coded 20 years ago. Discs look way better than streaming content in most cases, so a solid deal on this player is a must if you’re looking to see your favorite content in the best possible quality. —Parker Hall Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar Apple’s latest iPad Pro tablet (6/10, WIRED Review) has several new features. It packs a bigger and brighter display, an upgraded OLED screen, and the front-facing camera has landscape mode. Under the hood is the latest M4 chip, which delivers snappy performance. It’s also compatible with a variety of new accessories including Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil Pro, and Smart Folio case. However, we still recommend the 2022 M2-powered iPad Pro. It’s a great alternative if you want to save even more cash. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite iPad (7/10, WIRED Review) to recommend to most people. It’s powered by the A14 Bionic chip, which is the same one you’ll find in the iPhone 12, that never felt sluggish in our testing. It has a modernized design too, with slim bezels around a larger 10.9-inch Liquid Retina (IPS LCD) display, along with a USB-C port for charging, Touch ID in the power button, and a 12-megapixel selfie camera that’s been moved to the center of the iPad. It comes with support for the first-gen stylus or the USB-C Apple Pencil as well as the Magic Keyboard Folio and the original Smart Folio case. —Brenda Stolyar Apple’s latest iPad Pro tablet (6/10, WIRED Review) has several new features. It packs a bigger and brighter display, an upgraded OLED screen, and the front-facing camera has landscape mode. Under the hood is the latest M4 chip, which delivers snappy performance. It’s also compatible with a variety of new accessories including Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil Pro, and Smart Folio case. However, we still recommend the 2022 M2-powered iPad Pro. So, it’s a great alternative if you want to save even more cash. —Brenda Stolyar This excellent 3-in-1 charger for your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch is one of the best MagSafe chargers around. You can fold it away to a very compact size, making it an ideal travel companion. Charging for your iPhone goes up to 15 watts via a magnetic pad that can adjust to your preferred angle. There’s another pad for AirPods or other wireless earbuds, and a fold-out Apple Watch charger on the back. A 5-foot USB-C cable and wall adapter are included. —Simon Hill This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar The first-generation Apple Pencil has been around for years now, but it’s still a solid option. It packs features like pressure sensitivity (the lines get thicker as you press harder on the display), tilt sensitivity (for shading), and handwriting support within apps and search fields. As for supported iPads, it works with the base model iPad (6th Gen and later), iPad Mini (5th Gen), the iPad Air (3rd Gen), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st and 2nd Gen), and iPad Pro 10.5-inch. It reaches this price often, but it’s still a good deal. —Brenda Stolyar The second-gen Apple Pencil packs a variety of features including pressure sensitivity, handwriting support, tilt sensitivity, and double-tap (which lets you switch quickly between tools by tapping the stylus twice). It has support for wireless pairing and wireless charging too, so you can magnetically connect it to the top edge of the iPad and it’ll automatically start charging. As for supported iPads, it works with the iPad Mini (6th gen), iPad Air (4th gen and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen and later), and the 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later). It's not compatible with the iPad Air (M2) or iPad Pro (M4) though. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar The Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a large 27-inch screen that’s great for getting work done. I’ve been using it alongside the M4-powered MacBook Pro daily. It doesn’t have HDR, which means colors look a bit more saturated and contrasty to the neutral tones you’ll find on Apple’s Pro Display XDR. But the 5K resolution is stunning and sharp. Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s a great monitor that comes complete with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers. —Brenda Stolyar Having a proper ergonomic mouse can make a huge difference in your daily life, which is why we recommend the Logitech Lift for Mac, a vertically oriented mouse for Apple devices of all shapes and sizes. The vertical orientation puts your hand in a different position that some people may find more comfortable than a typical mouse, especially if you use your system for long periods at a time. It doesn’t cut where it counts though, with long battery life, a quiet magnetic scroll wheel, and a wide range of DPI settings to adjust to your liking. —Brad Bourque This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar This is the next step up from the MacBook Air with M3. It has three USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 (up from two on its predecessor) along with an SD card slot, HDMI port, high-impedance headphone jack, and MagSafe charging port. Apple also increased the memory on the base model from 8 gigabytes to 16 gigabytes. For an extra cost, you can add a nano-texture display too. You can also configure it with an M4 Pro or M4 Max for more power—both of which are also on sale. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar The M3-powered MacBook Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Macbook for most people. It has a nice 13.6-inch LCD screen and 1080p webcam while the M3 delivers a solid boost in performance compared to the M1 chip. It’s mainly great for everyday tasks but is certainly capable of handling a bit more like basic video editing or photo editing. Thanks to the M3, you can also use it with two external displays—the older chips only support a single display. —Brenda Stolyar Even though I have the M4-powered MacBook Pro at my disposal, I still reach for the 15-inch MacBook Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to use as my daily driver. It’s an excellent choice if you want a bigger screen without all the Pro features. It has the same modern build as the smaller model too, as well as a 1080p webcam and M3 chip. It works great for all my tasks, including word processing, video calls, sending emails, web browsing, and streaming content. For smoother performance, I suggest going for the 16 GB of unified memory. —Brenda Stolyar The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best option for ultimate power (7/10, WIRED Review). As with its predecessor, you’ll get a Mini-LED screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate, 1080p webcam, and a six-speaker sound system. This time around, Apple upgraded the USB ports with support for Thunderbolt 5 (120 Gbps/sec), giving you faster data transfer speeds. We tested the M4 Pro, which is a bit faster than last year’s M3 max chip, but it’s still capable of handling anything you throw at it. For even more power, you can pair it with the M4 Max. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Magna-Tiles may be expensive (a little less expensive now), but the return on investment is just staggering. We bought our daughter’s first set when she was 2 or 3 and enjoyed making little 2D ice cream cones or hats. Now she’s 9 and can make full villages for stuffed animals in the course of an afternoon. There are also a ton of different themed sets (also on sale) if you need more specialized pieces for race courses or jungles. —Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill Many of the best family board games are competitive and can sour into arguments all too easily, but Pandemic is a cooperative board game. Every player gets a role with unique special abilities, and you must all work together to wipe out four deadly diseases before they end humanity. Clear communication and coherent strategy are required, and you must leverage each player’s special abilities to win. Games can be completed within an hour, and there are many expansions for folks who enjoy the base game. —Simon Hill This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So Any building toy is great for encouraging creativity and hand-eye coordination, and WIRED reviewer Simon Hill’s whole family found the Clixo sets to be irresistible. The pieces are durable, flexible, washable, and colorful, and you don’t need a flat surface to build so you can play with them anywhere. They also come in themed sets that have glow-in-the-dark pieces. —Adrienne So If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill Tacto is an app with physical pieces that convert your iPad, Android, or Fire tablet into a game board. With Tacto Chess, your kids can learn the basics, from how the pieces move to strategies for victory. The animated app features friendly voice acting and stories, chess puzzles to solve, a move predictor, and your child can play against AI or another person. My kids had some fun with this when they were learning, and it helped them understand chess a little better. This appears in our Best STEM Toys for Kids guide. —Simon Hill These markers are currently en route to my house to test for an upcoming gift guide update. They’ve gone exceedingly viral on TikTok and I can’t wait to get my hands on them. But generally, across the internet, they’ve got positive reviews. Each marker has a brush tip and a fineliner tip. You’ll get 120 colors, a swatch card, and a carrying case. Consider pairing them with a cozy coloring book (also en route to my house!) for hours of fun this winter. —Louryn Strampe I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals My quest to find the best portable chargers has led me to test hundreds of power banks, but this is my current favorite. I love the look of this transparent, prism-shaped device, but it’s also extremely useful with a maximum output of 170 watts and a 24,000-mAh capacity, not to mention tough, with an IP66 rating for water resistance. It will fast charge just about any small gadget, from phones to laptops, and the handy wee display shows battery life as a percentage, time remaining, and the input or output in watts. I have once seen it slightly cheaper, but this is a good price. —Simon Hill This is one of the best portable power stations for camping or road trips because it’s a manageable size. EcoFlow’s River 2 Pro has a LiFeP04 battery inside, which is good for 768 watt-hours. It has all the ports you need to charge your phones and other small gadgets, and the X-Boost surge enables it to power small appliances. You can charge it from an outlet or solar panels, though it takes more than an hour, and the fan can get a little noisy. —Simon Hill The Anker 737 is the upgrade pick in our best portable chargers guide. With a whopping 24,000 mAh capacity, support for power delivery 3.1, and the ability to send or receive up to 140 watts, this is the only power bank you need. It weighs nearly 1.4 pounds but is fairly compact, considering how much power it holds. A smart digital display shows battery percentage, and you can tap the power button to cycle through stats, including the temperature, total output, and more. This versatile portable charger fast-charged everything I tested and can easily juice up three devices at once. —Simon Hill Anker’s 657 charging station is an excellent charging station for those who charge a lot of devices simultaneously but also want to keep their floor and drawers tidy. It packs six electrical outlet plugs (three on each side) and two USB-C ports (one USB-C and one USB-A) that you can plug more cables into. But that’s not all. It also comes with two USB-C cables that support fast charging, which is great for your phone or laptop. It’s a great accessory to keep at the office, at home, or anywhere you use multiple gadgets at once. —Brenda Stolyar If you have multiple Apple gadgets, this T-shaped wireless charger makes it easy to charge them simultaneously. It suspends your iPhone (at 15-watt charging speed) and Apple Watch midair, while the rounded base charges your AirPods Pro or AirPods (with a wireless charging case). This version comes with Qi2 certification, which is the latest standard that enables faster, more efficient magnetic wireless charging. —Brenda Stolyar This is the best cheap 3-in-1 wireless charger. It has a compact design with an iPhone pad that is secure and charges at 15 watts. It also comes equipped with both a charging brick and cable. The Apple Watch charger slots into the back as a separate unit, which means you can take it with you (as long as there’s a USB-A port to plug it into). You can also use it for StandBy mode or to watch videos in landscape orientation. —Brenda Stolyar As a fan of the translucent electronics craze in the 1990s, I was immediately drawn to this power bank. You can see the ports, chips, and rechargeable Samsung Li-ion batteries inside. While an even better Shargeek (now Sharge) device replaced this in our best portable chargers guide, this power bank is still great. A color display shows the voltage, current, and power flowing in or out, and you can dig deeper for more stats. The DC barrel port lets you specify voltage and current for different devices, up to 75 watts, the first USB-C supports PD PPS up to 100 watts, the second offers 30 watts and supports PD 3.0 and Quick Charge 4 standards, and the USB-A port is QC 3.0 at up to 18 watts. —Simon Hill If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar We like Ugreen's 145-watt charger for its very fast charge times. It's compact for the power it provides, though it's not light at 1.1 pounds. You get two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw all 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W. —Scott Gilbertson This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar The first portable power station from DJI can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and has DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can charge phones, power microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast charge most models. It gets a little noisy with a lot of gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our Best Portable Power Stations guide. —Simon Hill The Qi2 wireless charging standard was developed in partnership with Apple and features MagSafe-like magnetic alignment and speedier iPhone charging rates of up to 15 watts. This power bank can also charge other Qi2 devices (when they appear) and existing Qi devices (just more slowly). This compact power bank also has a handy kickstand, a two-way USB-C port, and an LED display that shows power and time to charge. You can attach MagSafe iPhones in portrait or landscape orientation, and it works with Apple’s StandBy mode, making it one of the Best MagSafe Power Banks. —Simon Hill Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill If your life goes well, you never have to use this thing and it just becomes some furniture for your trunk. But lord, what peace of mind if you leave your headlights on during a road trip through Wyoming. This model has saved the skin of a former WIRED reviewer on more than one occasion: a 1,000-amp, 12-volt battery pack with jump leads that’ll juice your battery in a bad situation. It also offers a USB-A port to charge your phone in a pinch, plus a built-in flashlight. This jump starter is often on sale below its list price of $130—but this is a good sale nonetheless. —Matthew Korfhage We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Mill food recycler just might be one of the most idiot-proof ways out there to dispatch food waste for those who don’t have access to municipal compost. Throw in food scraps (even meat!) and the Mill grinds and dries them into odorless, shelf-stable bits overnight. There’s a subscription program where you send the grounds off in the mail to be made into chicken feed, or you can use your grounds in the garden. We didn’t have the greatest success with that when we reviewed it earlier this year (6/10, WIRED Review), but we did find it to be a great device overall. —Kat Merck OK, so, full disclosure, we weren’t head over heels in love with the Bev (5/10, WIRED Review). But this is a really solid deal on it, and according to our scale, a score of 5/10 is “recommended with reservations.” This machine is like a Keurig, but for cocktails. If you fancy a mixed drink but don’t want to DIY it, simply supply your own liquor and pop in a capsule to make up a cocktail. You can also adjust the strength of your cocktail. We wish it took up less space on the counter, and that it could do a few tasks like pouring straight shots or shaking up drinks—but for this price, it’s a conversation starter worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill Long ago, I used to think rice cookers were fundamentally the same. Then I bought my Zojirushi, with its fuzzy logic circuit that measures moisture and adjusts cooking time and temperature accordingly. Now all my rice tastes wonderful. This goes the same way with pilaf, congee, and coconut rice. This is among Zojirushi’s most basic models, but it has served me so well I’ve become a near-constant ambassador. And this is a terrific deal on it. —Matthew Korfhage The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar The Braun MQ7 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic immersion blender. It’s a slightly older version of our favorite, but it’s still a great product, especially at this price. There’s a 500-watt variable-speed motor that responds to the pressure of your finger on the handle’s trigger. Press down fully for maximum speeds, or depress the trigger slightly for gentler blending. It’s comfortable to use and easy to clean, and it comes with a whisk attachment as well as a beaker for on-the-spot blending. —Louryn Strampe I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so this is a nice discount to get three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell As seen in our guide to the Best White Elephant Gifts, this funny little tumbler holds both cereal and milk separately to be enjoyed on the go without the cereal becoming soggy. There is a learning curve—small, spherical cereal bits like Cheerios work best; you must block part of the milk hole with your lower lip lest the milk flow outpace the cereal flow; and the whole contraption tends to leak if the lid isn’t twisted on at exactly the right angle. However, it’s available in seven different colors and makes a great gag gift or stocking stuffer for someone who either loves cereal or never has time to eat breakfast. —Kat Merck Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty Black Friday discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane Breville’s Smart Oven Pro air fryer and toaster oven is a remarkably versatile device, even among the new generation of combo ovens we’ve tested. It’ll roast you a 14-pound turkey. It’ll make pounds of less-greasy french fries or wings. It bakes cookies. And it fares surprisingly well at not just reheating pizza, but also making it in the first place. —Matthew Korfhage These aprons from Hedley & Bennett are the sort you might expect to find in professional kitchens—sturdy and waxed, and able to withstand a significant spill without leaving you with a wet belly button. They make great gifts—especially the themed aprons ranging from cutesy bagel aprons to surprisingly thoughtful Star Wars aprons. The whole site is 20 percent off for Black Friday. —Matthew Korfhage We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe We like this budget-friendly food dehydrator and think it offers the best bang for your buck out of all the models we tested. The stackable BPA-free plastic rings are a little bulky and awkward to fit in the dishwasher, but everything we dehydrated dried evenly. If you don’t want to drop a ton of money on a food dehydrator, but you want one that works efficiently, this is a model worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe As condiments go, Chengdu-based Fly By Jing is a luxury—a pricy and cheffy take on classic chili crisp that’ll add chili zip, fried-onion crunch; numbing Sichuan pepper; and wildly savory umami to pretty much anything from ice cream to noodles. (If you already know you’re a Fly By Jing fan, check out the brand’s advent calendar.) This is the best time to stock up or procure a gift for your favorite chilihead, with 20 percent or more off pretty much everything they make. Personally, I stick to the classic chili crisp, in the “big boi” size that comports with the volume of chili crisp I actually apply to my food. —Matthew Korfhage This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage It’s officially soup season, and what better way to get into the spirit than with the Philips Soup Maker (7/10, WIRED Review)? This bad boy can make so much soup. Also chilis, stews, purées, and smoothies. It’s kind of like an Instant Pot, if an Instant Pot was specifically for liquids. Choose your preferred texture, from chunky to creamy and more, and the machine will heat (or cool), blend, and stir the added ingredients to perfection. The machine is quiet and purpose-built. If you’re a soup enthusiast, or aspiring to be one, this deal is a goodie. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite budget pick, but we only recommend it if it’s on sale—so we don’t suggest waiting too long to snag it. It’s pretty basic compared to the other cordless stick vacs in Dyson’s lineup. Instead of a power button, it still comes with a trigger (so you’ll have to hold it down while vacuuming), and it comes with accessories like a Motorbar cleaner head, combination tool, and crevice tool. It’s unfortunately not compatible with the Laser Slim Fluffy Cleaner head (which shoots out a green laser to easily spot microscopic dust). It’s also not as powerful as the others, with a 120,000 RPM but it’s plenty for picking up dust and debris. —Brenda Stolyar This is currently our favorite robot vacuum. It has everything you need—reliable navigation with multi-floor mapping, a decent 8,000 Pa of suction, and multifunctional mopping and vacuuming—for a price that’s not totally insane. It uses lidar to navigate, which means you won’t have a camera creeping on your legs. Roborock’s SmartPlan—an AI-enabled feature that picks how to clean each surface in your house—also actually works! —Adrienne So There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So After reviewing literally hundreds of products, the Petlibro Granary Smart Camera Feeder sticks out in my mind as one of my most beloved items I’ve ever tested. This reliable, tech-savvy, and highly customizable automatic feeder is the future helicopter pet parents want. The feeder is controlled via an app with a schedule you create, and the best part is that it has a camera so that you can watch and hear your pet eat even when far away—and you can communicate with them via speaker. —Molly Higgins Smart plugs are pretty darn cool. Anything becomes a smart device with their help—just plug in and bam—you can remote control it. The Kasa Smart Plug Mini is one of our favorite smart plugs since it’s nice and small, making it easy to use without blocking a neighboring outlet. Use the app to make routines and scenes like you would smart lights, so that your house comes to life for you, or to act like you're home when you aren't. Buy one on sale, or score an entire four-pack on sale and deck out the house. —Nena Farrell The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell Automatic curtains are a great way to wake in the morning with natural light and to keep the heat in or out if you live somewhere sunny. The trouble is they tend to be horribly expensive, but you can get retrofit solutions, like this third-generation SwitchBot device. It is easy to fit and works well if you have the right kind of drapes. In fact, this is our pick of the best retrofit options for automatic curtains in our best smart shades guide. Just keep in mind that you need two for a pair of curtains. —Simon Hill The Hatch Restore 2 has been trending for a reason. It's both a sunrise alarm clock and a fantastic sound machine, and it's beautiful to look at to boot. I think it's better as a sound machine than it is a sunrise alarm—it’s recommended as such in our guide to the Best Sunrise Alarm Clocks—since it doesn't get quite as bright as our other picks to force you to rise or to double as a bedside lamp, but it does do a lovely range of colors and would still work in a very dark room. It's a great bedside gadget, and now it's on sale. —Nena Farrell This is a great little lamp that can transform the vibe of a room. All you have to do is plug it in and aim it toward the wall. It produces a halo-like effect with rainbow colors that make the space feel nice and cozy. (For a sunrise, check out our guide to the Best Sunrise Alarm Clocks.) It comes with a short cord though, so you’ll have to plug it into a power strip if you want it in a specific spot. I’d also make sure not to place it anywhere that someone can accidentally knock it over. —Brenda Stolyar OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapiro Bosch came out with its Air line of Energy Star- and CARB-certified air purifiers this summer, including small, medium, and large versions. Look for this large version (covers 2,745 square feet!) in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers. I’ve been using it on the main floor of my house that has 23-foot ceilings, and the difference in smells, dust, and overall air quality has been extremely noticeable. It’s also imperceptibly quiet with the fan running on the lowest speed. The only downside is the expensive filters that must be replaced every six to nine months. —Kat Merck Air quality is an invisible thing that can nonetheless have huge effects on how you feel. Might as well know how it’s going, right? The QP Pro Air Quality Monitor is less visual than some and the print’s a bit small, so it sits best on your desk or bedside table. But for that, there’s a lot of information: particulates, temp, CO2, humidity, volatile compounds, outdoor air quality index, hoo-boy. And even without a discount, the device is already low-priced amid its flashier competition. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell Nixplay is a classic in the digital photo frame world with a great screen and beautiful frame, but like many other digital photo frames we love, it's not a cheap investment. Except for right now, where you can get the touchscreen 10-inch Nixplay for the same price as cheap, crappy frames you'll find on Amazon. It's comparable to our favorite Aura frames, but for an extra-cheap price point right now. Plus, Nixplay plants a tree for every frame purchased. —Nena Farrell This versatile device is the pan-and-tilt pick in our best outdoor security camera guide. It’s ideal if you want a hands-off camera you can set up and leave to do its thing. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3X zoom in the center of the frame (it goes up to 8X hybrid zoom). There’s also 8 GB of storage built-in to keep things local. The relatively low 15 FPS frame rate is disappointing, and the two-way audio quality is not great, but there is onboard AI and subject tracking. —Simon Hill This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill What makes this one of the best indoor security cameras you can buy is the face recognition. It can warn you when there’s a stranger in your home and tell you when your kids or partner get in. With HDR, the 1080p video quality is crystal clear at 30 fps, and there’s automatic night vision when it’s dark. You also get decent two-way audio and enforced two-factor authentication, which is important for an indoor camera. The big downside is that you need a Nest Aware subscription costing $8 per month ($80/year) for 30 days of event video history and familiar face alerts, but that covers all your Nest devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar A security camera kit is an easy way to get started with home security, and this Eufy one includes two cameras with a home hub. The upgrade pick for folks seeking a local, subscription-free system in our best outdoor security cameras guide, the EufyCam 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a lot going for it. Solar is built-in for battery top-ups, video resolution goes all the way up to 4K, and there's 16 GB of local storage (expandable up to 16 TB) on the connected HomeBase 3 hub. You also get on-device people, pet, and vehicle recognition, and this system can even recognize familiar faces, though it’s not as good at it as Google’s Nest cams. —Simon Hill There are so many good-quality, affordable security cameras on the market, and the Blink Mini 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorites. It can record 1080p footage at up to 30 fps, offers decent low-light performance, and boasts on-device person detection. The catch is the subscription at $3 per month or $30 per year for a single camera, but it nets you a generous 60-day unlimited cloud video history. This camera is ideal for sitting unobtrusively on a shelf and keeping an eye on your home when you are away.—Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Our favorite budget bed frame, this option from AmazonBasics is great for first-time apartments or people with a ton of stuff. That’s because the 18-inch height leaves enough room under the bed for storage totes. You might still be cramming your shoes and off-season clothes under the bed, but at least you’ll have room to do it in an organized way. The durable frame folds down for easy transport and storage. And since it’s a platform, you won’t need a box spring either. —Louryn Strampe Buffy made a name for itself with its eucalyptus-based sheets and bedding—all of which are fantastic!—but I'm most in love with the brand's first cotton product, a set of percale sheets. Buffy's percale uses Supima cotton, which is a longer-staple cotton, making it extra soft while still retaining the crisp, breathable style of percale sheets. It's one of my favorite cooling sheets, and now a go-to for me even as a past percale hater. If you've been shopping for new percale sheets, snag these while they're on sale. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell The Internet is suddenly full of filtered showerheads whose makers promise all sorts of health benefits if you use their filters. We can’t speak for most of these claims. But we do know that we’ve tested this Afina, and aside from being a pleasant, broad-spray showerhead (it’s installed in my bathroom as I write this), our testing showed it’s beautifully effective at removing abrasive chlorine from your water before it hits your hair and skin. In fact, it’s one of only two brands we tried that dropped total chlorine to undetectable levels. And for now, it’s available at a sweet discount. But, a word: filters will need replacing every two months, at $29 to $40. —Matthew Korfhage This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good Black Friday get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Branch’s Ergonomic Chair is my first recommendation for anyone who just wants to upgrade their crappy old seat without spending a fortune. It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane The Plum Paper A5 Planner is a gorgeous, customizable planner that lets you add themed pages to complement your life. Whether you want pages for meal planning, fitness tracking, or to journal your baby's growth, Plum Paper has it all. Those baby-related add-ons are why it’s my paper planner pick for parents. (It will cost you extra to add these things on, but it’s around $5-$10 per add-on.) Plum Paper also has a ton of gorgeous sticker packs to order, from seasonal to fitness or baby themes. You can get custom stickers, too, which is fun. It's a great planner if you want something truly specific to your life—my copy has a section just for my son!—and you can get your own for 30 percent off right now. —Nena Farrell The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount for Black Friday. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque Topping our best routers guide, this affordable router combines a slick design with reliable performance. It’s only a dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) router, but should be fast enough for most folks and will cover an average-sized home with an internet connection of 1 Gbps or less. Ample connectivity includes four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. The setup is simple, TP-Link’s Tether app is easy to use, and basic security and features like QoS (Quality of Service) are included. —Simon Hill Anyone looking for an upgraded power supply should take a gander at the Corsair RM1000x. This full-size PSU can support up to 1,000 watts at 80 plus gold efficiency, which should be more than enough for most systems. It’s fully modular, for ease of installation and upgrading, or just for adding your own custom cables, and sports a 135-mm magnetic fan with a zero RPM mode for almost silent running. It’s not the biggest discount in the world, but enough to make it worth it for system builders who have waited patiently for prices to drop. —Brad Bourque The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill Simple to set up and use, Amazon's Eero mesh systems are easy to recommend and can act as smart home hubs with support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) mesh adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. It’s a great choice for busy households with many devices and a 1 Gbps or faster connection. Performance is excellent, but the 6-GHz band is short-range. The Eero Plus subscription is expensive ($10 per month or $100 per year) but includes comprehensive parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. Folks with smaller homes and connections up to 500 Mbps, should consider the Eero 6 (3-Pack) on sale at $150 ($50 off), but the more heavily discounted Eero 6+ (3-Pack) at $195 ($105 off) is a better deal if you can afford it. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Do you think of a laptop as metal framing around a web browser? Consider a Chromebook. Google rolled out a big upgrade called Chromebook Plus in 2023. The “Plus” stands for better performance—faster processors, more memory, more storage, and better video cameras. Our favorite of the models we've tried is Lenovo's Flex 5i Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's among the fastest Chromebooks we've tested for the money. It features a 3.75-GHz Intel Core i3-1315U CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of flash storage. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson The Swift Go offers outstanding performance for the price (7/10, WIRED Review). It also boasts an impressive 15-hour battery life. The downside is the speakers, which aren't great, and overall the body feels a little plasticky. But this is the least expensive Intel Core Ultra laptop we've tested by a few dollars, so if the budget is tight, the Swift Go is worth considering. —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson The ReMarkable 2 is a great digital notebook—so great that it’s No. 1 in our Best Digital Notebooks guide. I find myself grabbing it daily to write down all kinds of things—grocery lists! To-do lists! Ideas for novels I'll never write!—or upload PDFs for me to read and edit. It's pricey, though, making this Black Friday sale super exciting. This on-sale bundle includes the Marker Plus, which has an eraser on the end for you to easily edit your notes without needing to switch between your tools on the page. Choose a bundle with the folio of your choice—I love the Type Folio for taking more detailed notes or mixing up my writing screen of the day, but the Book Folio has a better price—to get the sale price. —Nena Farrell This is a fantastic and simple full-size mechanical keyboard that employs Cherry’s new MX2A switches. There’s no USB-A port, hot-swap sockets, any kind of programmability, or even a dial, so it really is barebones, but it excels in its function as a well-built wired keyboard, and it’s affordable. —Julian Chokkattu Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Ray (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the oddest little soundbar in the Sonos lineup, but at this price, it’s a slam dunk for the right buyer. Unlike its siblings and nearly all modern offerings on our best soundbars list, the Ray doesn’t offer HDMI connection, using optical input instead. That means it won’t automatically work with your TV remote and it doesn’t even come with one of its own. That said, it can be programmed to work with most modern remotes. Alternatively, you can control it via the Sonos app, which unlocks tons of other features like Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay 2, and the ability to link up with other Sonos speakers as part of a whole-home system. Those are features soundbars at this price level almost never include. But the Ray’s best feature is its excellent sound, pumping out clear, musical, and surprisingly meaty audio for a bar proportioned more like a Bluetooth speaker. –Ryan Waniata This is the Bar 1300X (8/10, WIRED Recommends) deal I’ve been waiting for. If you’ve been after transformative Atmos immersion in a large-and-in-charge soundbar system, your time is now. The 1300X’s standout feature is its removable, battery-powered surrounds that can detach from the main bar as surround speakers when needed, or reattach, charge, and play as part of the larger bar. They’ll even work as standalone Bluetooth speakers. It’s a cool feature, but the 1300X’s Dolby Atmos performance is even cooler. You’ll feel like you're there when the up-firing speakers get rolling, putting you in a dome of sound. Music also sounds great, and the included subwoofer provides power and poise for everything you play. The app is a little lackluster for sound adjustments, but otherwise, I’ve got nothing but kudos for this uniquely versatile setup. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata It’s not the latest and greatest soundbar that we have tested, but the Signa S4 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a slim bar with a relatively large wireless subwoofer that makes it great for action fans. I do wish it had Wi-Fi for music streaming, but as long as you connect it to your TV, you can just use the apps on there for that. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The AirPods Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) come with a bunch of useful features including Conversation Awareness (which lowers your music and background noise when you're having a conversation), Adaptive Transparency mode (that combines noise cancellation and transparency to adjust audio), and support for Find My in case you lose them. They also have above-average sound quality, with excellent noise cancellation, crisp highs, and authoritative bass. —Brenda Stolyar The wait for the AirPods Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends) with USB-C is finally over. Aside from the updated charging port, these are identical to the Lightning version (also on sale)—complete with great noise cancellation, a massive soundstage, and rich bass. They also pack great build quality, with a mesh headband and fabric earcups. The USB-C version also comes in a few new colors, including starlight, orange, purple, blue, and midnight. —Brenda Stolyar If you have an iPhone, the workout buds you need are still the Beats Fit Pro. (If it’s not broke, why fix it?) These everyday buds fit remarkably well, even in my tiny ears, with flexible fins. The H1 chip pairs seamlessly with all Apple products, and they sound great! I have gone running and accidentally put my head under a faucet while wearing these and they still work great. For more Apple-specific picks, check out our guide to the Best AirPods. —Adrienne So Ever since it was bought by Apple, Beats has been churning out some of the world’s most underrated earbuds. The Studio Buds + are no exception, with noise canceling, excellent integration with iPhones, and a more comfortable fit than you’ll get from AirPods Pro. They’re also better for workouts, thanks to built-in earfins that keep the IPX4-rated headphones in your ears. —Parker Hall It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20 this Black Friday. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall These affordable earbuds from Nothing (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are among my favorite cheap headphones right now. They come in a cool clear plastic case and feature cool yellow accents, and they offer virtually every feature you can expect from high-end buds these days. You get noise canceling, comfortable eartips, and honest-to-God decent sound quality overall. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a pair of buds that are definitively better than these, even for nearly double this price. —Parker Hall Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These classic wired headphones have been in style since the moment they came out decades ago. The cool metal headband meets molded plastic earcups with vintage-style foam ear coverings, making these the best headphones ever to play with your CD or cassette player. —Parker Hall Hearing damage is no joke, and it’s permanent. I’ve loved carrying these cheap earplugs from Earpeace on my keychain for when things get too loud, whether at a concert or elsewhere. They’re cheap, and they really do better with wide frequency ranges than the foam earplugs you’re probably most used to. If you always find yourself wishing you brought a pair, now is a good time to snag them. —Parker Hall The Beats Studio Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) were solid headphones at full price, but after dropping a full $100 to around $250 on average, they became a lot more appealing. Now they’ve slipped even further, moving closer to the “gotta grab” category thanks to a mix of engaging sound and impressive usability. Extras include solid noise canceling, brilliant transparency mode, Apple-centric extras like “Hey, Siri” voice commands, and one-touch pairing for iPhone or Android devices. Their build isn’t as posh as premium models from Sony or Bose, but at a fraction of the price, they’re the better buy for tighter budgets. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata Everyone needs a good pair of computer speakers, especially if you work from a home office. These desktop speakers from Audioengine have wired and Bluetooth connectivity, and they have front ports for better bass when placed against a wall or on a desktop. They’re not the newest model ever, but they’re still our favorite. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated this Black Friday. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Ultimate Ears makes some of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy, and the Everboom (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) is another solid option with a slightly inflated price. This sale brings it in line with more competitors. The Everboom has a few upgrades over siblings like the Megaboom 4, including slightly louder peak volume and extra bass, making it a mildly better choice for letting things fly at outdoor gatherings. It offers similar features elsewhere, including the ability to connect with up to 150 other UE speakers, a customizable EQ, and even a megaphone feature that lets you call through the speaker from the app. It's rugged, it’s weatherproof, and on sale, it’s a solid deal that’s worth adding to your arsenal. —Ryan Waniata Sonos’ new app has made headlines for its troubles, but I’ve had the Era 300 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) on my network since it launched and never had an issue with it. The company seems to have mostly shored up its app issues elsewhere, letting the Era 300’s sound performance shine as it should. This Dolby Atmos-ready speaker can create a big and spacey soundstage with 3D audio tracks, and sounds fantastic with stereo music too, providing clear and intimate detail with deep bass. The speaker is loaded with features, including voice control via Alexa and Sonos’ built-in system, tons of streaming options, and the ability to connect with other Sonos speakers in a whole-home or surround sound configuration. That’s a lot of good stuff at an equally good sale price. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale for Black Friday, but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $500 off till December 15, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage No tamping, no grinding. Just fill the Cafe Affetto with beans, make sure the water tank has water, and push the button. Voila: a lovely, no-fuss espresso. The Affetto is a slick, fully automatic machine with a built-in steaming wand, 20 bars of pump pressure, and a small profile that preserves counter space. We’ve seen lower prices from less-than-verified sellers, but this Black Friday discount is a terrific deal on a solid all-in-one espresso maker. —Matthew Korfhage The Tally (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a scale for true coffee nerds. Sure, it weighs your coffee. It’ll also set a timer to track weight during a pour-over, for the true beanheads. Even more fun, the “Brew assist” mode will let you enter your desired coffee-to-water ratios and simul-calculate how much water you’ll need for the perfect brew as you weigh out your beans. Is this all a bit much? Sure—unless you’re a total nerd. Y’all know who you are. WIRED contributor Joe Ray loved the scale’s intuitive design. Like most Fellow coffee gear during Black Friday weekend, the Tally is 20 percent off right now. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s very easy to see why the Kindle Paperwhite is Amazon’s most popular model. The 12th-generation model (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a larger display (7 inches instead of 6.8), the highest contrast ratio on any Kindle (for sharp text and images), and three months of battery life (an increase from two months on its predecessor). It’s also the thinnest yet. We recommend it to anyone who is buying their very first Kindle. The Signature Edition is also on sale for $155, which comes with double the storage, auto-adjust brightness, and support for wireless charger. —Brenda Stolyar Even without the discount, the basic Kindle was already the most affordable option. And now, it’s under $100. The latest version is an iterative update compared to the 2022 model but it does come with a higher contrast ratio, a 25-percent-brighter front light at the highest setting, and a faster page-turn rate. It’s also the smallest Kindle, making it easy to hold one-handed and to travel with. It comes in a super fun matcha color, too. —Brenda Stolyar The latest kid-friendly Kindles received the same treatment as the rest of Amazon’s lineup—with a faster page-turn rate, a brighter screen, and a higher contrast ratio. This discount is for the basic model, which is small and compact. It also comes with a variety of kid-friendly covers to choose from. But the Paperwhite Kids is also on sale for $140 ($40 off). It comes with a larger display that’s better for reading graphic novels. Plus, it’s waterproof so you won’t have to worry about those accidental spills as much. Both models also come with six months of access to Kids+, Amazon’s subscription service for age-appropriate books, and a two-year warranty. —Brenda Stolyar Fire Tablets aren't great, but then again they're only $75 on sale—what do you want for that price? If all you plan to do is watch Amazon content and do basic tasks like email and browsing the web, they are reasonably capable and certainly affordable. The Fire HD 10 is our favorite of the bunch, with a 1080p screen and 3 gigabytes of RAM so it can handle watching videos and browsing with quite a few tabs open. —Scott Gilbertson The Fire HD 10 Kid's Edition is exactly the same as the regular above, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a very few questions asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon's tablets are limited, but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). —Scott Gilbertson The best value in the Fire tablet lineup, the HD 8 was updated earlier this year with more RAM (3GB) and a better 5 megapixel camera. It retains the same form factor, and battery life is still rated at 13 hours, although we rarely got over 11 in our testing. Storage options are either 32 GB or 64 GB, but I'd say stick with the cheaper of the two and add a microSD card (up to 1-TB, we like this Samsung card, also on sale for $27). —Scott Gilbertson The Fire Max 11 (5/10, WIRED Review) is the most powerful tablet in the Fire lineup, almost like Amazon decided to make a real tablet. The problem is, despite being speedy and capable on the hardware side, it's still crippled by Amazon's subpar Fire OS. At full price we don't recommend this one, however, now that it's down to $140, it's a good deal. It's capable, much sleeker than the rest of the Fire tablets, and if you want to be more productive with it, the bundle with a keyboard is also on sale for $225 ($125 off). —Scott Gilbertson The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but it's on major sale for Black Friday. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20 this Black Friday. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room, and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, showing me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also liked it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Omnilux Contour LED face mask is soft and flexible, making it easy to wrap around your face. With its 132 LED lights that reach 633 nanometers of red light, it’s designed to stimulate collagen production and help fix fine lines. It doesn’t have a blue light version like other LED masks we recommend, but it’s the best price you’ll find right now on an LED mask. —Nena Farrell The NuDerma Therapy Wand, now $59, is an affordable way to elevate your skincare routine for about less than half the cost of a single facial. Its neon-powered applicators stimulate circulation and oxygenate your skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and hydrated. Use it after applying your serums and creams to enhance their potency. —Boutayna Chokrane The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-tos. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off for Black Friday, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar used this toothbrush for years until he unfortunately left it behind in a hotel room. RIP, little toothbrush. This model has three cleaning modes, a pressure sensor, and a built-in timer that helps you brush thoroughly and efficiently. It comes with a travel case, a charger, and extra brush heads, and it’s kitted out in black, which may be more appealing than the dainty electric toothbrush designs that are popular of late. —Louryn Strampe Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Our favorite cheap electric toothbrush is even cheaper for Black Friday. You can usually find it for around $20, but it’s just $15 right now. It does a great job cleaning, has a gentle sonic cleaning style, and even comes with seven (that’s right, seven!) replacement heads. That’s not even $2 for the toothbrush and each head. It comes in pink, too. The only downside is that the charger is inconvenient, but for how much you get for the low price, it’s worth it. —Nena Farrell Yes, the TheraFace Mask is one of the pricier LED masks on the market, so if there’s ever a time to indulge, it’s during a sale. What sets it apart from other LED masks is the added vibration therapy, which massages pressure points around the eyes, browline, and scalp. Using it feels less like skincare and more like a therapeutic retreat I can experience from the comfort of my bed. —Boutayna Chokrane Why choose between skincare tools when you can have them all? With six interchangeable heads, the FDA-cleared TheraFace Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) offers an impressive range of facial treatments: cleansing, microcurrent, percussive massage, and LED light therapy (blue, red, and infrared). You don’t need to spend $400 for clear skin, but with $100 off, it’s a tempting treat for any beauty enthusiasts looking to pamper themselves at home. —Boutayna Chokrane The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage There are hair straighteners that are best for thick and curly hair and hair straighteners that are best for finer, more wavy hair, but it’s rare to find one that works great for both. As the top pick in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this ceramic iron makes short work of most hair textures—former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has one she’s been using on her curls since college, and this is the iron I use on my own unruly 3a curls for daily touch-ups. I also like the maneuverability of the smaller plates and the quick one-minute heating time. —Kat Merck If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck This is the best curling iron for long hair. It’s suitable for all hair types and has a tourmaline ceramic-coated barrel that’ll help your hair stay silky and frizz-free. The curling iron heats up quickly, and the long barrel means you have plenty of room to work so you won’t have to contort around trying to perfect your styling technique. This model also has dual voltage, so it’ll work on any international trips. —Louryn Strampe Deemed the best curling iron for long-lasting curls in our guide to the Best Curling Irons, WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary loved the elongated barrel of this iron, as well as the metal clamp to hold a curl in place while it sets. GHD is a quality brand that also makes some of our favorite hair straighteners as well, like the Chronos and Platinum+. Kilkeary wasn’t a huge fan of the lack of temperature dial on this curling iron, but she still recommends it as a durable option that produces long-lasting results. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe The MakeUp Eraser is a thing of beauty. The soft microfiber cloth is one of our favorite reusable products. It lives up to its name—simply get it wet with warm water and rub it gently over your face. It’ll demolish your makeup while being kinder to your skin than disposable makeup wipes. I’ve successfully used it to remove smoky eye looks, red liquid lipstick, and heavy contour—all in one fell swoop. You’ll still want to cleanse with a traditional cleanser or some micellar water, especially to remove traces from harder-to-reach areas like your inner corner or lashline, but this is an excellent and economical way to wash your face. The cloth is machine-washable and dries pretty quickly as well. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck The Pattern Blow Dryer will be featured in an upcoming guide to hair diffusers. It’s got three heat settings and two air speeds, and it comes with four attachments. I loved using this hair dryer. It’s great for damaged hair since it doesn’t get as hot as other dryers, and the attachments can be attached vertically or horizontally for added control. The diffuser has great ventilation and dries my curls efficiently while also giving them more oomph. The dryer isn’t too heavy either, so if you’re biceps-challenged like I am, you’ll still be able to get good use out of it. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite Android phone is back at its lowest price! The Pixel 8A is everything anyone needs in a smartphone (8/10, WIRED Recommends), from excellent cameras and slick performance to smart software features and a bright display. It has all the accouterments, including wireless charging, an IP67 water resistance rating, and seven years of software support, which is unparalleled in a smartphone that costs this much. Read our Best Pixel Phones guide to see all the fun little software tricks to take advantage of. —Julian Chokkattu This is the first major discount on Google’s brand-new Pixel smartphones, launched in late August (9/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re some of the smartest smartphones, with plenty of new features powered by Google’s Gemini large language models. For example, you can get instant transcriptions and summaries from voice recordings or phone calls. The XL version has the same features with a bigger display (and a bigger battery too). It costs $849 ($250 off). —Julian Chokkattu OnePlus will likely unveil a successor very soon in the new year, but the OnePlus 12R is an excellent midrange Android phone that’s speedy in every way (it can fully recharge in 30 minutes with the included charger and cable!). It has an AMOLED 120-Hz screen, a 5,500-mAh battery that lasted me two days, and the 2023 flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset can handle the most demanding games. This is one of the lowest prices we’ve tracked. You should also consider the flagship OnePlus 12 while you’re here, because it’s also on sale for $550 ($100 off). It has better performance and wireless charging support. —Julian Chokkattu There are some quirks, but the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (6/10, WIRED Recommends) is the booklike folding phone I’d buy if I were in the market, and this is a tantalizing price. It’s very slim and using the external display feels like a normal phone, with nearly the same dimensions as the Pixel 9 Pro. But, of course, you can open the Fold up to reveal a much larger 8-inch internal screen, perfect for catching up on shows on the commute home. —Julian Chokkattu OK, brace yourselves, because the Galaxy S24 lineup now has four phones: Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the new Galaxy S24 FE (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The latter is the cheapest, taking some of the highlights from the flagship lineup and putting it in a more affordable body, lowering the price. At $475, it’s a great smartphone with long software support (seven years), even if it’s a bit drab. The S24 and S24+ won’t feel dramatically different, offering boosted specs here and there, but it’s the S24 Ultra for $950 ($350 off) you should consider if you’re after Samsung’s best. This one has the S Pen stylus built in, not to mention the 5X optical zoom, and the titanium build. Just know that Samsung is expected to debut a successor in January, so wait if you want the latest and greatest. This deal is also at Samsung and Best Buy. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu This 10-foot cable is long enough to allow you to place your phone where you want while charging (or continue using it without having to crouch near the outlet). It’s a durable braided nylon cable from Anker that comes with a lifetime warranty. It can deliver up to 100 watts to fast-charge any phone or tablet and comes with a handy cable tie. You can get it in black or white, but I like the red because it stands out, making it less of a tripping hazard. This is the best long cable in our best USB-C cables guide. —Simon Hill This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu OtterBox is usually my “Most Protective” recommendation in our many smartphone case guides. But the company makes all sorts of cases, even ones that are colorful, stylish, and slim. If you’re in the market for a new case, the company is offering 30 percent off sitewide on Amazon as well as its website. If you need a place to start, here are a few picks: Own a Pixel 9 series phone? I like the Commuter Series for $25 ($15 off). iPhone 16 owners should check out the protective OtterBox Defender Series Pro XT for $49 ($21 off). Anyone with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series should try the Commuter Series for $28 ($12 off). —Julian Chokkattu This is one of our favorite wireless chargers but it is expensive, so this sale might be the perfect time to grab one. We recommend springing for the Qi2 version, as it will be compatible with the wave of Qi2 Android phones coming in 2025, but it also works with MagSafe iPhones (iPhone 13 models and newer support the Qi2 protocol). If you're just an iPhone person, the standard MagSafe version of this charger is also on sale for $77 ($33 off). Check out our Nomad Black Friday sale post for more deals. —Simon Hill Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The newest Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes in two sizes, and I very much recommend you snag the larger 45-mm variant. It doesn’t look that big on small wrists, but you get much better battery life (just a smidge over a full 24 hours). Google’s health and fitness tracking capabilities are excellent, and there’s even a unique Loss of Pulse feature on the way in the US (it’s available in select countries), which could help contact emergency services in the event of cardiac arrest. —Julian Chokkattu The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The Withings’ line is consistently our top analog pick for both Best Smartwatches and Best Fitness Trackers. My colleague Simon Hill tested it and found that it’s comfortable, looks great, and has a long battery life and a comprehensive suite of health features that track heart rate and monitor your ECG. Two minor dings—Simon was unimpressed by the optional new subscription, and I found that the cycle tracking feature that comes with temperature tracking was not able to predict my period, but then again, no wrist-based wearable really can (so far). —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This easy-to-build home arcade cabinet features a 17-inch color LCD screen, a light-up marquee, authentic arcade controls, and runs 14 Namco games, including every version of Pac-Man and a few extras like Galaga and Dig Dug. Whether you grew up in the arcades or not, these games still have a powerful addictive hook, and this Pac-Man arcade machine brought me closer to my teen kids. This is a decent discount that drops it to the lowest price we’ve seen. —Simon Hill This isn't technically a Black Friday deal, but Meta is currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale for Black Friday and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill If you’re hunting for an upgraded gaming headset with all the bells and whistles, the Arctis Nova Pro is our favorite pick for serious gamers. It includes a desktop DAC with convenient volume controls, real-time information, and EQ settings. Plus, it’s super comfortable for gaming long hours, with soft ear cups and an extra stretchy headband support that reduces strain on the top of your head. The wired version is on discount, but there’s a Wireless version as well (8/10, WIRED Recommends) if that’s more your speed. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque Looking for a totally souped-up set of flight controls? The Turtle Beach VelocityOne Flight is a complete system for feeling like you’re actually at the controls of your favorite planes. The 180-degree yoke feels more true to life than a simple joystick, and the hall effect sensor means it should have a nice long lifespan. It also packs in bells and whistles like a screen on the yoke, and dedicated controls for throttle and propellers, making this an excellent upgrade option for anyone who loves to play Microsoft Flight Simulator. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount for Black Friday, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill This year's i7 or last year's i9? If you're building your own PC, this is a great deal. Intel's high-end gaming option, the 13th-gen Core i9, was an incredibly versatile performer and still stacks up will in benchmark tests against newer, lower end chips like the 14th-gen i7. At this price, we say go for it. —Scott Gilbertson Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe WIRED reviewer Adrienne So reviewed the 2-watt version of these bulletproof walkie-talkies (8/10, WIRED Review) and I’ve started testing this version, which has more than twice the power and promises a half-mile of carry in even the least advantageous of environments (and up to 35 miles when circumstances are right). They’ve got USB-C charging and IP56 water resistance and the signal has been clear and strong in my testing. This is the first time the 5-watt version of the Rocky Talkie radio has ever been on sale. —Martin Cizmar The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger this Black Friday. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar This Coleman folding/rolling grill has a couple nice features, like dual burners for different heat zones on the same grill. But it also had a nasty habit of pinching my fingers whenever I wasn't careful when collapsing it. So long as you're careful, this one will do everything the more expensive Weber Traveler we recommend does and allow for dual temperature cooking. —Louryn Strampe Almost everything at Ooni is 20 percent off for Black Friday. While the Solo Stove may be the top pick in our Best Pizza Ovens roundup (temporarily! We don’t know for sure yet), we’ve tried and recommend pretty much everything from Ooni, which basically invented the category when the company launched in 2012. The Volt is its electric oven, which is the best pick if you’re staying inside right now. The specs are better than its closest competitor, the Breville Pizzaiolo, and I’ve made everything from cookies to roasted broccoli in mine. —Adrienne So Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Not only is the Theragun Sense the quietest of all Theraguns, but it also packs the same premium features as the higher-end models. The built-in LCD screen and guided breathwork routines deliver the same luxe factor as the Pro Plus model for $400 less. The four included attachments (standard ball, dampener, thumb, and micro-point) cover all the muscle groups. —Boutayna Chokrane Don’t let the size of the Theragun Mini 2 fool you—though she be but little, she is fierce! With three attachments (standard ball, dampener, and thumb) and 150-minute battery life, the Mini 2 is the best for targeting sore spots on the go. It’s not the best for the harder-to-reach areas, but it excels in portability. I’ve been carrying it in my gym bag for months and hardly notice its presence. It even includes a zip-up case; one less pochette to buy. —Boutayna Chokrane You can buy standard foam rollers for way less, but the Therabody Wave Roller justifies its price with its tech-enhanced features. With five vibration frequencies, it allows you to target specific muscle groups with varying intensities. The added benefit of Bluetooth connectivity lets you pair it with the Therabody app for even more customized options. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature, and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through Cyber Monday. —Adrienne So I’ve been testing this down puffer instead of my usual Patagonia puffer so far this winter and have been duly impressed by the perfect trim cuts of the recycled shell fabric, smooth zippers, and how light it is (less than a pound for my XL). —Martin Cizmar WIRED contributor Kristin Canning said that this was the best bug spray, so imagine my triumph when I looked it up on Amazon and saw that this is the bug spray I’ve already bought! I agree with Kristin’s assessment that the spray feels lightweight and the smell isn’t off-putting. This is a good time to stock up if you’re already planning your sunny holiday vacation. —Adrienne So I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe If you’re tired of getting on a ladder to put up your Christmas lights each year, try Govee’s Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro instead. They’re a set of permanent lights, designed to stay up all year and for years to come. These smart lights can handle a nice range of temperatures (from -4 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) and are weatherproof with an IP67 rating for the lights and an IP65 rating for the control box. WIRED reviewer Simon Hill says the adhesive works well to attach them to your home, and that installation for these permanent lights was easy overall. You can easily customize the lights for the holidays and months beyond using the Govee app to create almost any kind of color design or find any lighting effect you could hope for. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar raved about this travel backpack to an almost annoying extent. Not only can it max out your allotted carry-on space, it’s a real trail-ready backpack that’s comfortable enough to wear for 10 to 20 miles of hiking. The straps are fully adjustable, the pockets are well-considered, and there’s everything from webbing to a padded hip belt. It also comes in a very bright and attractive yellow. —Adrienne So No, a basic Travelpro soft-sided carry-on isn’t going to be the flashiest personal accompaniment when you’re going through the airport. But there’s a reason this is the brand most flight attendants have—you get a tremendous amount of bang for your buck. Our tester found that the handle was sturdy, the wheels rolled smoothly, and it weighs a mere 5.4 pounds. This is one of the best bags that you can get for around $100. —Adrienne So San Francisco-based Aer is known for its travel bags’ durability and minimalist designs, and the Aer Travel Pack 3 combines both of these with an unreal amount of organization. Our favorite work travel pack in our guide to the Best Carry-on Luggage, this bag can be carried as a backpack or a briefcase. It has a tech-organizing pocket in front of a larger compartment that zips flat to accommodate folded clothes or packing cubes, and it fits neatly under the seat on most airlines’ planes. The only down side is a weirdly small water bottle holder that won’t fit most larger water bottles (precisely the kind you’d want to bring for long trips). —Kat Merck An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck Are you traveling with kids this holiday season? Then I highly suggest you avoid the pain of the checked luggage line and get your kids their own carry-ons. I would’ve saved myself from a graveyard of dead luggage if I’d just bought them State bags from the start instead of trying to save some money. In addition to being as sturdy and lighter than my own carry-on, the State bags have kid-friendly features, like fun prints and an organizational front pocket. Everything at State is 30 percent off with the code BF24. —Adrienne So If you want to fly with only an underseat item, the wheels on this teeny, tiny carry-on pop off so you can simply slide it under your seat (although I flew with it on Alaska Airlines and it fit without me taking the wheels off). The wheels are easy to pop off and tuck into the seat pocket. However, they are loud and rattle when you’re walking, especially over rough surfaces like sidewalks. If this doesn’t make you grit your teeth, this tiny suitcase is impressively functional for the price. —Adrienne So The Beis Carry On is viral for a reason. It's not only a beautiful bag, coming in an eye-catching array of colors (I’ve got the bag in the light-blue slate, but the warm brown maple color is always calling my name), but also comes with a bunch of great features. A built-in weight! A bag lock! Two organizer bags that match the color of your bag! A soft cushion for your hand on the handle! If I could take this bag everywhere, I would. It's 30 percent off right now, and Beis doesn't often have sales, so there’s no better time to upgrade your carry-on luggage. —Nena Farrell Our favorite toiletry bag for women is the Beis Dopp Kit. It has a handful of handy compartments, and WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane says the water-resistant section is a total game changer when packing liquids or fragrances. It's nice and sturdy, with a wire top that will stay open for you to look through without losing its shape. It's on the large size compared to other Dopp kits, but that means you can truly store everything you need in this kit. If you need even more space, Beis' Cosmetic Case, another Gear team favorite, is 30 percent off. —Nena Farrell Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Pulling double duty as a duffel bag and a computer bag, this stylish black Cordura carry-on has a laptop compartment that fits two computers and a spacious main compartment for clothes or gear. An included clip-on strap allows it to be worn as a crossbody, and I like that it can be stuffed under the seat on most airlines. The dual water bottle holders are weirdly baggy and could use improvement, but otherwise, as a working parent I love this bag as a carry-on for longer flights with my family, as it not only fits my work gear but all my kid’s flight necessities as well, from headphones and snacks to sweatshirts and books. Put in the code at checkout to see the discounted price. —Kat Merck Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson Wanna be a YouTube star? This is the camera you need. The 18- to 50-mm (f/1.8 to f/4) equivalent zoom lens is plenty sharp and wide, and the Multi-Face Recognition mode is extremely clever and effective. In this mode, the ZV-1 II will detect when another face comes into the scene and automatically stops down the aperture to keep everyone in focus. There are limits, but it works surprisingly well. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson Fujifilm's Instax Link Wide Printer is my favorite Instax printer. The printers aren't as fun as the cameras, but I already have a digital camera, and the results I get pairing images from a real camera with an Instax printer outshine what I get from Instax cameras. If you already have a good digital camera or a solid smartphone camera, an Instax printer is the way to go and this is the best one to get. I love the bigger images of the Link Wide, and it has nice extras like the ability to print multiple images in one go with collage print or add fun features to your images like hearts, glitter (shudder), or any other of the 15 editable templates in the app. —Scott Gilbertson The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone, and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Read next Read next

Title: Bitcoin Well On Track To Hit $740,000 By April 2028 — Pantera CEO

Full Content:
Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Pantera Capital — the first crypto fund in the United States — is forecasting that the price of Bitcoin could smash $700,000 in 2028, roughly a week after the flagship crypto rocketed toward a six-digit price. Despite Bitcoin’s astronomical growth in recent months, Morehead thinks it’s “still early” for BTC and that the cryptocurrency’s bull market has yet to run. Dan Morehead noted in a Nov. 26 blog post that 5% of financial wealth is now exposed to Bitcoin. Yet, that figure is set to increase with more regulatory clarity in the U.S. as pro-blockchain president-elect Donald Trump heads back to the White House. This would result in faster institutionalization of Bitcoin. BlackRock and Fidelity with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have started a “massive transformation,” posited Morehead. “It’s [Bitcoin] already done three orders of magnitude,” Morehead wrote. He revealed that his investment company’s crypto-focused Pantera Bitcoin Fund, which was launched in 2013, has notched an over 131,000% lifetime return on its first Bitcoin purchase at $7. “Another one seems plausible.” Per the Pantera CEO, Bitcoin has been on a trendline that will push its value to roughly $740,000 by April 2028 (a nearly 670% growth from the current price point) if it continues its growth pattern. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was trading for about 2.3% higher at around $95,294 at publication time. “I just can’t help thinking that we still have many more years of very compelling returns.” $740,000 is “not an inconceivable number, relative to $500 trillion in financial assets,” he explained. At this price, Bitcoin would boast a market capitalization of a whopping $15 trillion. “I can imagine an investor thinking: ‘Bitcoin has doubled this year. Well, I guess I missed it,’” Morehead said. “That’s the wrong mindset.” Furthermore, Morehead told CNBC’s Squawk Box on Nov. 27 that he doesn’t think Bitcoin could ever crash to zero now as it has reached “escape velocity” with 300 million investors around the world owning it.

Title: AMD and Alphabet: Billionaire Steve Cohen Loads Up on 2 Big AI Stocks

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AI is booming, providing an important pillar of support for the stock market’s substantial year-to-date gains. Put into numerical terms, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index, which features many of the AI sector’s major names, has added nearly 30% for this year to date – on top of the 43% gains it registered last year. Unlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF! Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter The significance of AI, both as a technological force and an investment opportunity, is underscored by the attention it’s garnering from Wall Street titans – the billionaire investors who’ve made fortunes betting on the right trends. Steve Cohen, the founder and CEO of Point72, is among them. Drawing parallels between the current AI boom and the tech revolution of the 1990s, Cohen views AI not as a speculative bubble but as a ‘really durable’ phenomenon poised to reshape industries and markets. More importantly, Cohen is willing to put his money where his mouth is, and is reportedly preparing to set up a new billion-dollar hedge fund to focus on AI stocks. In the meantime, his main firm, Point72, is already betting heavily on AI, and has opened new positions in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), two of the industry’s leaders. According to the data from TipRanks, both AMD and GOOGL feature Strong Buy consensus ratings and double-digit upside potential for the coming year. Let’s give them a closer look, and find out just why billionaire investor Steve Cohen is loading up on these two big AI stocks. Advanced Micro Devices First up is AMD, a leading innovator in the semiconductor chip industry – and a company that is angling to challenge the chip giant Nvidia for a larger slice of the AI pie. While AMD is not in the same trillion-dollar league as the market leader Nvidia – its market cap of ~$229 billion ranks it sixth among its peers – the company has built up a solid business for itself, putting a wide range of top-end PC processor and AI-capable accelerator chips on the market. Among AMD’s leading products are several newly announced chips and chipsets, including the Ryzen 7 9800X3D desktop processor, optimized for high-end gaming uses; the Versal Premium Series Gen 2, designed to improve data movement efficiency and to unlock more memory storage in data-intensive markets; and the Instinct MI300A APU, the market’s second exascale accelerator, designed to power the fastest-ever supercomputer. Whatever the immediate application, the common denominator in all of these is AI – AMD’s newest chips have the speed and capacity to handle data-heavy workloads. That’s by design, of course. AMD has strong relationships, based on its AI-capable chips, with such powerful industry names as Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. With its new product offerings, AMD is aiming to expand its role in the global AI market, which the data aggregation site Statista estimates will reach $92 billion in total revenue by the end of 2025. Steve Cohen evidently thinks AMD will be a major player in the field. During Q3, Point72 opened a new position in AMD. The billionaire hedge manager picked up 871,731 shares of the stock, a holding that is worth over $120 million at the current share price. At the end of last month, AMD reported its results for 3Q24. The company’s quarterly revenue was strong, beating the forecast by $110 million and growing more than 17% year-over-year to reach $6.82 billion. Earnings, reported as a non-GAAP EPS, came to 92 cents per share, in-line with expectations, and up 31% from the prior year. Despite the gains in earnings, shares in AMD are down 17% since the quarterly results were released. While the results were good, investors were disappointed with the firm’s Q4 guidance, which predicted $7.5 billion at the midpoint to the revenue range, below the $7.55 billion that analysts had expected. For TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter, however, the decline in share price creates an opening to buy. Buchalter sums up his bullish view of this stock, writing, “We view AMD’s forward roadmap and progress on building its networking ecosystem reinforcing our confidence it can create and capture value in AI computing. Against a very large and still early AI compute TAM, we believe AMD is well on the way to cementing its position as the de facto merchant alternative to NVIDIA’s leadership position.” The analyst follows this with a Buy rating on the stock, and adds a $185 price target that indicates potential for a 34% gain in the next 12 months. (To watch Buchalter’s track record, click here) The 30 recent analyst reviews on AMD break down 23-to-7 in favor of Buy over Hold, giving the shares their consensus rating of Strong Buy. The $137.72 trading price and $185.46 average target price together imply a potential one-year upside of 34.5%. (See AMD stock forecast) Alphabet Now we’ll turn to Alphabet, the parent company of the internet’s leading search engine, Google, and leading video platform, YouTube. Through these subsidiaries, Alphabet holds the world-leading position in the field of internet search – but more importantly, the company has access to a treasure trove of raw data, the feedstock of AI applications. While the online advertising business based on that data trove has pushed Alphabet to a market cap over $2 trillion, making it the fifth-largest publicly traded firm on Wall Street, it’s the company’s AI bent that is more likely to propel it into the future. Alphabet already makes use of AI to improve results from its search engines, both Google and YouTube, using the tech to offer search suggestions and to target relevant ads to web surfers. Precise ad targeting is key, as Alphabet’s revenue stream comes mainly from its online advertising segment. In addition to its uses in web search and digital advertising, AI is essential to Alphabet’s online translation capabilities. AI-powered large language models (LLMs) allow the company to conduct its ad business around the world in the audiences’ native tongues, and to offer automated translation services that expand users’ horizons to websites outside of their native languages. All of this builds into Alphabet’s Gemini platform, the company’s purpose-built, customer-facing, generative AI platform. Alphabet’s platform is already working with large language models, and can even help users with complex tasks such as computer coding. Alphabet is working to expand Gemini into all of its products – but especially into its Android smartphone operating system. That last will bring a functional AI assistant into the world of smartphone applications, and from there the vistas are endless. Turning to Steve Cohen’s recent GOOGL buys, we find that he bought big last quarter – to the tune of 1,159,225 shares. At the current price, this new position is worth approximately $196 million. In its last quarterly report, for 3Q24, Alphabet’s management stated that the company saw strong success in its core revenue-driving business of online advertising. The company’s ~90% market share in online search provides a strong foundation for the digital ad business. Alphabet’s revenues in the third quarter came to $88.3 billion, growing almost 15% year-over-year and beating the forecast by $2.05 billion. The company’s EPS was also strong, up 37% year-over-year to reach $2.12 per share – and beating the forecast by 27 cents per share. In coverage for Pivotal Research Group, analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak takes note of Alphabet’s leading position in online search and advertising, as well as the company’s strong business lines in AI and cloud computing. He writes of the internet giant, “If the status quo holds, GOOG appears to be in a very strong competitive position with a deep moat around their dominant core search business model (~90% market share ex China) and an obvious path to leverage 90%+ (ex China) global device presence (which we believe will dominate consumer AI assistant use), a strong AI platform and financial might to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement. GOOG also holds a strong #3 position in cloud computing, which as evidenced by the 3Q acceleration in revenue growth has dramatic growth potential given still relatively low (15-20%) cloud market share of enterprise workloads (+ benefits from AI), controls the largest video/audio streaming platform in the world (YouTube) and the world’s top browser (Chrome) with a 65% global market share (ex-China).” Looking ahead, Wlodarczak puts a Buy rating on GOOGL shares, with a $225 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 33%. (To watch Wlodarczak’s track record, click here) The Strong Buy consensus rating on Alphabet is based on 34 recent Wall Street reviews that favor Buy over Hold by 27 to 7. The shares are priced at $169.12 and the $207.9 average price target points toward a 23% gain in the year ahead.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 AI News Updates Wall Street Is Monitoring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other AI news updates that Wall Street is monitoring. AI companies in the United States, many of whom have extensive business relations in China, are waiting anxiously for President-elect Donald Trump to assume office and announce possible changes to American policies towards China that will provide greater clarity on future US trade with the Asian country. Top executives from US-based firms were in China recently to meet with Chinese business leaders amid rumors of a massive spike in tariffs on goods being imported to Washington from Beijing. Latest reports from news platform Axios contend that Donald Trump is considering the appointment of an AI czar in the White House to coordinate federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Per the report, billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly backed Trump during the 2024 election and is rumored to have a key influence over the President-elect on AI policy, will not be the AI czar. However, the report adds that Musk is nevertheless expected to be involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases related to AI. xAI, the AI startup Musk founded in 2023, recently raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. xAI is competing with OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker with a valuation of more than $157 billion.

On November 26, telecom news platform Capacity reported that the chipmaker had released the latest version of its ROCm software stack for GPUs, adding tools to cut down AI development times. The report underlined that Version 6.3 of the open source software stack aims to provide better performance and scalability for AI and high-performance computing workloads on AMD Instinct GPUs, like the new MI325X. Overall, AMD ranks 7th on our list of AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Apple deals are better than ever for Black Friday–get them all right here

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (today – November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). There is no longer any need to wait, and we’re seeing some fantastic deals! We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Black Friday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: For more monitors for your Mac look at Best Mac monitor deals for Black Friday U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry There are Black Friday deals on many of the streamers, for example, Hulu is bundling Disney+ for a saving of 85% (just $2.99 a month). Peacock has 75% off at $1.99 month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is pay $8 a month, 50% off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-days trial, or its 3-months if you buy an Apple product. There are even some Black Friday deals: As for Apple’s set-top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it. See our round-up of the Best Apple TV deals. U.S. U.K. In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on the any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad! Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29 in 2024) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks. You can get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Here’s how it compares to last year and the year before. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals: Check out these time-limited tech deals before they go.

Status: Brought to market in April by Sherry FitzGerald, seeking €3.6 million. It was sold in September for €3.2 million, according to the Property Price Register (PPR). Architectural gems are my thing, and houses right beside the sea would also (imaginary budget allowing) most definitely be my thing. The Lake House in Howth is a place of absolute wonder, hemmed between its own lake and the endless stretch of Burrow Beach, which overlooks Ireland’s Eye. The back garden is knitted into the dunes, with specific decks on which to enjoy a tipple of your choice. It also has an outdoor terrace at the end of the extensive living area that faced west to catch sunsets; the roof of the terrace was carved in the shape of a keel, to honour the owner’s legacy of sailing. Inside, the living areas are well considered, with a long sittingroom graduating into a Snaidero kitchen. The house splits into two levels, with a study set between them on the landing. The views from The Lake House over the sea were staggering, and it was clear that the previous owner had loved every minute of living there. Read our full review here. – Miriam Mulcahy Status: Listed in June 2024 at €1.75 million through Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes & Sherry FitzGerald Radford. Achieved in excess of its asking price, according to selling agent John Radford. It appears on the Property Price Register as having sold for €1.35 million in October 2024, which accounts for the house on one acre. The remainder of land, almost 27 acres, was sold separately. Situated along Wexford’s historic Norman Way, this Georgian residence dates all the way back to 1801. Though described on the National Built Heritage website as “a farmhouse”, the five-bedroom pile extends to a considerable 483sq m (5,198sq ft). Lying on almost 30 acres, the grounds have two paddocks, four stables and a hay barn likely to have attracted those who wish to entertain equestrian pursuits. In addition to its pristine condition, as owners who had lived there since 1997 had restored it fully to its former glory, there is a restored coach house, offering a large livingroom and games room. Add to this a 13m swimming pool and its proximity to a number of beaches and golf courses, along with access to fresh fish at nearby Kilmore Quay, and you can understand why it was on the market for such a short time. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: On the market through Sherry FitzGerald Catherine O’Reilly since October, seeking €695,000. Lynam Cottage has been my favourite house reviewed by The Irish Times this year, not just for its postcard-perfect exterior, light-filled interior and stunning surroundings, but for the fact that it introduced me to the story of its namesake – the author, journalist, linguist and administrator Joan (Shevawn) Lynam. Elizabeth Birdthistle’s research into Lynam, who bought and refurbished the cottage in the 1960s, painted a portrait of a fascinating woman who worked for Alfred Hitchcock, worked and wrote for various media outlets, and who was passionate about Basque independence and found herself banned from Spain for a time because of it. She put her knowledge of the region into a novel, The Spirit and the Clay, which she set during the Spanish Civil War. Lynam wrote her second book, Humanity Dick – a biography of eccentric TD Richard Martin – no doubt surrounded by the rolling Wicklow hills at the cottage. And today, following a thorough renovation by its current owners, Lynam Cottage is an idyllic retreat – the envy of writers and artists alike. It also incorporates some of my favourite interior features, such as a checkerboard floor at its entrance, skylights in the living areas and a window seat overlooking the countryside. Read our full review here. – Jessica Doyle Status: Brought to the market by Sherry FitzGerald seeking €10 million in September, and went sale-agreed that month, according to the selling agent. The selling price has yet to be confirmed, and it has yet to appear on the Property Price Register. Hidden away down a long driveway off Sandycove Avenue East, this very private period home on three-quarters of an acre of gardens that run down to the sea is a few minutes’ walk from the Forty Foot and Joyce Tower. The 594sq m (6,394sq ft) five-bedroom villa-style detached house, built in 1840, was effectively rebuilt and completely modernised over the past 24 years. Inside, it’s all bright, modern and warm (it has a B3 Ber), with rooms opening on to terraces that look over the formal gardens to the sea. A separate two-storey studio mews is accessed from Sandycove Lane. Read our full review here. – Frances O’Rourke Status: On the market with Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty since September, seeking €3.8 million. It may seem obvious to choose a very large period property in Rathmines as the home that stood out for me in 2024, but it wasn’t the sheer size of it or the Dublin 6 address that impressed me most, it was how the house was lived in. This six-bedroom home, measuring 410sq m (4,413sq ft), is set out over three floors, with every corner in use. For the last 22 years it has worked around family life, so there were no rooms that were kept out of bounds for visitors’ eyes only. The ground-floor level adapted to every stage, from toddlers to teenagers. The reception rooms are both refined and relaxed, with the shuttered sash windows facing out to Brookfield Tennis Club. And the beauty of it all is that number 5 has not lost an ounce of its period charm along the way. Here’s hoping it goes to another family that will fill each room with life and love. Read our full review here. – Alison Gill Status: Came to the market with Knight Frank in September seeking €2.1 million. Property is still on the market, but under offer. This semidetached end-terrace house was one of three Regency-style houses inspired by the developer Gerry Walsh’s love of the musical Oliver! and the famous Who Will Buy scene, set at a Regency terrace in Bath. To him, it symbolised beauty and harmony, and he sought to recreate homes with the same style and flair, taking years to assemble plots of land until he could build the terrace. Every corner, every space, every window and door was drawn and redrawn up to 200 times, and the meticulous attention to detail means every room, lobby and hallway works. The garden received the same exigent level of oversight, with each limestone slab on the patio individually chosen, pleached pear trees, and every bit of outside hardware, such as the downpipes, are of the highest quality. Walsh installed a Snaidero kitchen not just on the ground level, which has an open-plan kitchen, living and dining area and a pretty sittingroom to the front, but also in the utility room in the basement, along with a gym and home cinema. I particularly love the elegance of the stairs and its long mahogany banister running continuously over the house’s three floors. Read our full review here. – Miriam Mulcahy Status: On sale through Knight Frank since October, seeking €7.75 million. Imagine the perfect weekend: your best friends are in Dublin to watch Ireland beat the All Blacks at the Aviva Stadium in Ballsbridge. After the match you repair to Rob Kearney and Jamie Heaslip’s pub The Bridge 1859 for a few celebratory scoops, followed by a steak dinner in Roly’s Bistro. Then it’s all back to your new abode at number 23 Elgin Road, where the party really gets started. This four-bed Victorian home in the heart of Dublin’s embassy belt, and done up to the nines by interior designer Jane Gilloway, is the perfect place for entertaining guests in style. You can put your friends and their families up in two luxury bedroom suites in the side extension, and in the two substantial detached modern mews houses at the end of the back garden. Gilloway has added plenty of showstopping touches to the elegant period home, including antique cast-iron radiators, Jacobean stained-timber floors and, in the kitchen/breakfastroom, Paonazzo honed marble worktops. With a spacious media room, pool table, fully equipped bar, wine room and integrated sound system, it offers all the ingredients for a marvellous party – and a luxurious lifestyle. Read our full review here. – Kevin Courtney Status: Brought to market by Sherry FitzGerald in June seeking €2.45 million. It went sale-agreed for over the asking price in August, says Michael Grehan of Sherry FitzGerald. An end-of-terrace Victorian five-bed with a pale pink exterior in an enclave of otherwise mostly redbrick homes off Rock Road, opposite Blackrock College, was at various times a school “for the education of young ladies”, a Protestant boarding house and also the home of a famous Irish bell-maker. It sold relatively quickly – overlooking Blackrock Park, the Dart line and the sea, its location was likely a strong selling point. Built in 1844, but Georgian in style, with bow windows and nearly floor-to-ceiling multi-paned new sash windows, Montereau had been modernised, with smart new bathrooms and kitchen – but there was still room to revamp the basement and a garage beside the house. Read our full review here. – Frances O’Rourke Status: Brought to the market in February 2024 with an asking price of €1.75 million. It was later listed at €1.5 million for auction, where it sold for €1.675 million according to selling agent Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty. This lovely two-storey, four-bay 260sq m (2,800sq ft) Victorian structure dates from 1895 and lies along one of the quietest roads in Sutton. It retains some unusual decorative embellishments of Indian accent, such as it ogee-headed arches to the veranda, as described on Fingal County Council’s record of protected structures. While its architectural origins have been lost to the annals of time, its Indian connection was presumed to be due to the fact that its first resident was a Dutch sea captain, with links to the Dutch East Indies and the East India Trading Company. And, although it would benefit from some upgrading, it has spectacular details such as elaborate window mouldings and striking cornicing. But what impressed most was its location, overlooking the sea with super views from rooms to the front. In addition, its southwesterly aspect allows for spectacular sunsets from these rooms, as the property is angled to maximise its expanse of views across Dublin Bay. It had been home to the Beshoff fish and chip family since 1978, until it sold earlier this year. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: For sale through Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty since August, seeking €7.5 million. If you want to be lord of the manor in your own big estate, you usually have to head out to the countryside, but Tinnahinch is a classic country pile transplanted into the south Dublin suburb of Foxrock. This expansive Georgian-style home is built to the highest standards, with period features including Flemish bond facade, Portland stone sills and bespoke oak joinery. There’s a grand entrance hall and gallery landing, richly appointed reception rooms, spacious kitchen/diningroom and luxurious bedrooms. What really completes the idyllic picture is the 1.7 acres of lush gardens landscaped in the style of 19th-century Irish gardener William Robinson, who pioneered the move away from formal gardens to a wilder, more naturalistic style. The gardens are a magical mix of native and exotic plants, with winding paths, wooden bridges, tumbling waterfalls and serene lily ponds, with numerous spots to relax, read a book or dine al fresco.

Graphology (or graphoanalysis, but not graphanalysis) is the analysis of the physical characteristics and patterns of handwriting purporting to be able to identify the writer, indicating psychological state at the time of writing, or evaluating personality characteristics.[1] It is generally considered a pseudoscience.[2][3][4][5][6] The term is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to forensic document examination due to the fact that aspects of the latter dealing with the examination of handwritten documents are occasionally referred to as the frequently confused term graphanalysis. Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although supporters point to the anecdotal evidence of positive testimonials as a reason to use it for personality evaluation, empirical studies fail to show the validity claimed by its supporters.[7][8] The word Graphology is derived from grapho- (from the Greek γραφή, "writing") and logos (from the Greek λόγος, which relates to discussion or theory).[9] Jean-Charles Gille-Maisani stated in 1991 that Juan Huarte de San Juan's 1575 Examen de ingenios para las ciencias was the first book on handwriting analysis.[10][11] In American graphology, Camillo Baldi's Trattato come da una lettera missiva si conoscano la natura e qualita dello scrittore from 1622 is considered to be the first book.[12][13] Around 1830 Jean-Hippolyte Michon became interested in handwriting analysis. He published his findings[14][15] shortly after founding Société Graphologique in 1871. The most prominent of his disciples was Jules Crépieux-Jamin who rapidly published a series of books[16][17] that were soon published in other languages.[18][19] Starting from Michon's integrative approach, Crépieux-Jamin founded a holistic approach to graphology. Alfred Binet was convinced to conduct research into graphology from 1893 to 1907. He called it "the science of the future" despite rejection of his results by graphologists. After World War I, interest in graphology continued to spread in Europe as well as the United States. In Germany during the 1920s, Ludwig Klages founded and published his finding in Zeitschrift für Menschenkunde (Journal for the Study of Mankind). His major contribution to the field can be found in Handschrift und Charakter.[20][21] Thea Stein Lewinson and J. Zubin modified Klage's ideas, based upon their experience working for the U.S. government, publishing their method in 1942.[22] In 1929 Milton Bunker founded The American Grapho Analysis Society teaching Graphoanalysis. This organization and its system split the American graphology world in two. Students had to choose between graphoanalysis or holistic graphology. While hard data is lacking, anecdotal evidence indicates that 10% of the members of International Graphoanalysis Society (IGAS) were expelled between 1970 and 1980.[23] Regarding a proposed correlation between gender and handwriting style, a paper by published by James Hartley in 1989 concluded that there was some evidence in support of this hypothesis.[24] Although graphology had some support in the scientific community before the mid-twentieth century, more recent research rejects the validity of graphology as a tool to assess personality and job performance,[2][25][26] and today it is considered to be a pseudoscience.[2][3][4][5][6][27] Graphology is primarily used as a recruiting tool to screen candidates during the evaluation process. Many studies have been conducted to assess its effectiveness to predict personality and job performance. Recent studies testing the validity of using handwriting for predicting personality traits and job performance have been consistently negative.[2][25] In a 1987 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire using writing samples from the same people.[8] In a 1988 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Myers-Briggs test using writing samples from the same people.[28] A 1982 meta-analysis drawn from over 200 studies concludes that graphologists were generally unable to predict any kind of personality trait on any personality test.[29] Measures of job performance appear similarly unrelated to the handwriting metrics of graphologists. Professional graphologists using handwriting analysis were just as ineffective as lay people at predicting performance in a 1989 study.[30] A broad literature screen done by King and Koehler confirmed dozens of studies showing the geometric aspects of graphology (slant, slope, etc.) are essentially worthless predictors of job performance.[25] Rowan Bayne, a British psychologist who has written several studies on graphology, summarized his view of the appeal of graphology: "[i]t's very seductive because at a very crude level someone who is neat and well behaved tends to have neat handwriting", adding that the practice is "useless... absolutely hopeless".[31] The British Psychological Society ranks graphology alongside astrology, giving them both "zero validity".[31] Graphology was also dismissed as a pseudo-science by the skeptic James Randi in 1991.[32] In his May 21, 2013 Skeptoid podcast episode titled "All About Graphology," scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning reports:[6] In his book The Write Stuff, Dr. Barry Beyerstein summarized the work of Dr. Geoffrey Dean, who performed probably the most extensive literature survey of graphology ever done. Dean did a meta-analysis on some 200 studies: Dean showed that graphologists have failed unequivocally to demonstrate the validity or reliability of their art for predicting work performance, aptitudes, or personality. Graphology thus fails according to the standards a genuine psychological test must pass before it can ethically be released for use on an unsuspecting public. Dean found that no particular school of graphology fared better than any other... In fact, no graphologist of any stripe was able to show reliably better performance than untrained amateurs making guesses from the same materials. In the vast majority of studies, neither group exceeded chance expectancy. Dunning concludes:[6] Other divining techniques like iridology, phrenology, palmistry, and astrology also have differing schools of thought, require years of training, offer expensive certifications, and fail just as soundly when put to a scientific controlled test. Handwriting analysis does have its plausible-sounding separation from those other techniques though, and that's the whole "handwriting is brainwriting" idea — traits from the brain will be manifested in the way that it controls the muscles of the hand. Unfortunately, this is just as unscientific as the others. No amount of sciencey sounding language can make up for a technique failing when put to a scientifically controlled test. Max Pulver supports a system called symbolic analysis in which he looks for symbols in the handwriting.[38][39][40][41] Each approach to handwriting analysis has spawned several systems. Integrative graphology focuses on strokes and their relation to personality.[42] Graphoanalysis was the most influential system in the United States, between 1929 and 2000. The Sistema de Xandró is another method of integrative graphology.[43][44][45] Holistic graphology is based on form, movement, and use of space.[42] The psychogram[12][46][47] is another method which uses specific diagrams to analyze handwriting. The Personal Worth Chart is one such method developed by the Handwriting Consultants of San Diego[48] during the early 1980s. The psychograph is an additional psychogram method.[49] was developed by Leslie King during the 1970s .The Wittlich Character Diagram,[50][51] and the Muller-Enskat Protokol[52][53] are other psychogram methods. Psychologists Leopold Szondi, Augusto Vels, and Girolamo Moretti invented their personal schools of graphology.[54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65] Four academic institutions offer an accredited degree in handwriting analysis: The majority of material in the field is oriented toward the Latin writing system. Courses offered in the subject reflect that bias. Every system of handwriting analysis has its own vocabulary. Even though two or more systems may share the same words, the meanings of those words may be different. The technical meaning of a word used by a handwriting analyst, and the common meaning is not congruent. Resentment, for example, in common usage, means to feel or exhibit annoyance. In Graphoanalysis, the term indicates a fear of imposition.[68][69] A report by the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information says that handwriting analysis without informed consent is a privacy violation.[70] There have been a number of studies on gender and handwriting.[71][72][73][74] Uniformly the research indicates that gender can be determined at a significant level. The published studies on ethnicity,[75][76][77] race,[78][79][80] age,[81][82][83] nationality,[84] gender orientation, weight, and their relationship to handwriting have had mixed results. One of the rules of thumb in human resources is that if an individual who has an ADA-defined disability cannot take a test, then nobody can. As a result, tests that cannot be adapted for use by those individuals will not be used by a company. Handwriting clearly falls into the group of tests that cannot be adapted to be administered to individuals who fall within one or more ADA-defined disabilities. Blind people, for example, do not develop the required fluency in handwriting, for the writing to be correctly analyzed. Questions that handwriting analysts ask before doing an analysis can be illegal under this act.[85] A company takes a writing sample provided by an applicant, and proceeds to do a personality profile, matching the congruency of the applicant with the ideal psychological profile of employees in the position.[86] A graphological report is meant to be used in conjunction with other tools, such as comprehensive background checks, practical demonstration or record of work skills. Graphology supporters state that it can complement but not replace traditional hiring tools. Research in employment suitability has ranged from complete failure[87] to guarded success.[88] The most substantial reason for not using handwriting analysis in the employment process is the absence of evidence of a direct link between handwriting analysis and various measures of job performance.[89] The use of graphology in the hiring process has been criticized on ethical grounds[90] and on legal grounds in the United States.[91] Graphology has been used clinically by European counselors and psychotherapists.[50][51][52][53] When it is used, it is generally used alongside other projective personality assessment tools, and not in isolation. It is often used within individual psychotherapy, marital counseling, or vocational counseling.[92] In its simplest form only sexual expression and sexual response are examined. At its most complex, every aspect of an individual is examined for how it affects the other individual(s) within the relationship.[93] The theory is that after knowing and understanding how each individual in the relationship differs from every other individual in the relationship, the resulting marriage will be more enduring.[94] Medical graphology is probably the most controversial branch of handwriting analysis.[95] Strictly speaking, such research is not graphology as described throughout this article but an examination of factors pertaining to motor control. Research studies have been conducted in which a detailed examination of handwriting factors, particularly timing, fluidity, pressure, and consistency of size, form, speed, and pressure are considered in the process of evaluating patients and their response to pharmacological therapeutic agents.[96] The study of these phenomena is a by-product of researchers investigating motor control processes and the interaction of nervous, anatomical, and biomechanical systems of the body. The Vanguard Code of Ethical Practice, amongst others, prohibits medical diagnosis by those not licensed to do diagnosis in the state in which they practice. This is the practice of changing a person's handwriting with the goal of changing features of his or her personality. It originated in France during the 1930s, spreading to the United States in the late 1950s.[97][98] The purported therapy consists of a series of exercises which are similar to those taught in basic calligraphy courses, sometimes in conjunction with music or positive self-talk.

Title: Crypto Oversight May Shift To CFTC Under Trump Administration: Report

Time Published: 2024-11-28T04:30:29Z

According to a report by Fox Business, citing sources familiar with the matter, the incoming Donald Trump administration may empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate certain crypto assets. With nearly two months remaining before Trump assumes the US presidency, the incoming Republican administration is already making strides toward fulfilling campaign promises, including creating a favorable regulatory framework for digital assets. The Trump administration is expected to significantly expand the CFTC’s role in overseeing the $3 trillion digital assets industry. This move could potentially scale back the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies. Outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler has often faced criticism for stifling the growth of the digital asset sector by classifying most cryptocurrencies – apart from Bitcoin (BTC) – as securities. The SEC’s controversial “regulation-by-enforcement” approach has made the agency unpopular among US crypto industry participants. With the Biden administration ending, pro-crypto Trump’s incoming presidency signals a possible shift in Washington’s stance on digital assets. A recent ruling from a Texas court dealt a blow to the SEC by overturning its contentious broker-dealer rule. Sources suggest that the CFTC’s expanded role may include regulating digital asset exchanges and spot markets for cryptocurrencies classified as commodities, such as BTC and Ethereum (ETH). Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, commenting on the matter, said: With adequate funding and under the right leadership, I think the CFTC could hit the ground running to begin regulating digital commodities on day one of Donald Trump’s presidency. It is worth highlighting that Giancarlo is being considered for the nebulous “crypto czar” position under the Trump administration. According to the report, the new role is expected to “help execute crypto policy and potentially oversee an industry-led advisory council.” Beyond issues like immigration and trade tariffs, Trump’s campaign also focused on positioning the US as the “crypto capital of the world.” To support this vision, the president-elect is appointing regulators with moderate to positive views on digital assets. Asset managers like Bitwise and WisdomTree are optimistic that renewed interest in the digital asset industry could lead to the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for virtual assets such as XRP and Solana (SOL). Recent reports suggest that Trump’s transition team may create a national Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to tackle inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties. The idea has gained support from asset managers like BlackRock. Interestingly, similar efforts are underway globally. Brazilian federal deputy Eros Biondini recently introduced a bill to establish a national BTC reserve, aimed at diversifying the country’s treasury holdings. BTC trades at $94,784 at press time, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Investing.com-- BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) has entered a preliminary deal to buy HPS Investment Partners as the world’s largest asset manager looks to further grow its scope, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. BlackRock has a “handshake deal” with the firm, FT reported, with general terms of the deal to be announced after the Thanksgiving Holiday. A final price will be around $12 billion. HPS was considering an initial public offering that would have valued the firm at around $10 billion. The firm is one of the biggest private credit managers on Wall Street, and was founded by former Goldman Sachs employees in 2007. Wednesday’s report comes after BlackRock completed a $12.5 billion buyout of Global Infrastructure Partners. Earlier this year, the company had acquired UK data firm Preqin for around $3.2 billion. The asset manager is seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing private credit sector, given that alternative assets offer much more lucrative fees than traditional markets.

Title: Attor­ney Gen­er­al Ken Pax­ton Sues Black­Rock, State Street, and Van­guard for Ille­gal­ly Con­spir­ing to Manip­u­late Ener­gy Mar­kets, Dri­ving Up Costs for Consumers

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/27/2024 3:24:51 PM PST by george76 Attorney General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and Vanguard Group, three of the largest institutional investors in the world, for conspiring to artificially constrict the market for coal through anticompetitive trade practices. Over several years, the three asset managers acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the United States, thereby gaining the power to control the policies of the coal companies. Using their combined influence over the coal market, the investment cartel collectively announced in 2021 their commitment to weaponize their shares to pressure the coal companies to accommodate “green energy” goals. To achieve this, the investment companies pushed to reduce coal output by more than half by 2030. Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street utilized the Climate Action 100 and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative to signal their mutual intent to reduce the output of thermal coal, which predictably increased the cost of electricity for Americans across the United States. These firms also deceived thousands of investors who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits. Yet these funds pursued ESG strategies notwithstanding the defendants’ representations to the contrary. Deliberately and artificially constricting supply increased prices and enabled the investment companies to produce extraordinary revenue gains. This conspiracy violated multiple federal laws that prevent a major shareholder, or a group of shareholders, from using their shares to lessen competition or engaging in other anticompetitive schemes. Further, the companies broke Texas antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” said Attorney General Paxton. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers. This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” A coalition of 10 other States joined Attorney General Paxton on the lawsuit. The Buzbee Law Firm and Cooper & Kirk are serving as outside counsel.

Yet these funds pursued ESG strategies notwithstanding the defendants’ representations to the contrary. Deliberately and artificially constricting supply increased prices and enabled the investment companies to produce extraordinary revenue gains. This conspiracy violated multiple federal laws that prevent a major shareholder, or a group of shareholders, from using their shares to lessen competition or engaging in other anticompetitive schemes. Further, the companies broke Texas antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” said Attorney General Paxton. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers. This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” A coalition of 10 other States joined Attorney General Paxton on the lawsuit.

By Jon Chesto, The Boston Globe It was the memo heard around the working world: Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy informed tens of thousands of workers that they should head to the office five days a week come January. The new policy announced in September sparked intense conversations about returning to the office, and not just at Amazon. The move was seen as a harbinger, an important milestone in the ever-shifting approach to in-person work since the COVID-19 pandemic rewrote the rules nearly five years ago. As Amazon workers digested Jassy’s directive, Sal Lupoli was huddling with his own management team in Lawrence, trying to figure out the best way to improve collaboration among his 200 or so employees at his real estate firm, Lupoli Cos. In the end, the restaurateur-turned-developer came to a similar decision last month as Jassy: It’s time, finally, to return to prepandemic practices and bring people back all week long. “There’s a level of camaraderie, there’s a level of interaction, there’s a level of ‘me reading your body language’ that you can’t do over Zoom,” said Lupoli, whose office employees now come in five days a week. “We’ve lost so much of this interaction. We’ve just got to get it back.” From giant companies like Amazon to local businesses like Lupoli’s, many executives have been rethinking their return-to-office requirements after a year of relative stability. And while many major office employers show no signs of budging, evidence of a changing mood is starting to pile up. A recent survey by consultancy firm KPMG shows 79 percent of US chief executives expect to resume largely in-office work within the next three years, up from 62 percent a year ago. Along with Amazon, other tech employers with a major presence in Massachusetts are well on the way, such as Salesforce — now at three days a week or more, depending on the job, as of Oct. 1 — and Dell, every day for sales teams as of Sept. 30. CarGurus will require workers to be in the office 60 percent of the time starting in January — essentially three days a week, up from two currently — and environmental services firm Veolia North America is adopting a similar requirement. Chief executive Micah Remley, whose Boston firm Robin makes workplace management software for employers, said the balance of power has shifted to employers in the current labor market, compared with two years ago. In some places, attendance requirements focused on building an in-office culture are factored into performance reviews or are used to subtly trim payrolls as people voluntarily leave and are not replaced. “The vise is starting to tighten,” Remley said. “You can just see this tide turning. … The data doesn’t show it yet, but we are seeing it. Companies are newly emboldened.” Once a laggard in the share of the workforce returning to the office, Boston now appears to be around the national average, if not above it. Mayor Michelle Wu recently bragged to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce that occupancy at office buildings owned by BXP now exceeds 90 percent of prepandemic levels — on Tuesdays through Thursdays. Financial services, law, and real estate workers are more likely to be in the office. Tech startups and government agencies, less so. Return-to-office trends could have huge consequences for the battered commercial real estate industry, which is suffering from some of the worst vacancy rates in memory. Roughly one out of every four offices in downtown Boston are empty. While there are some signs the situation could be stabilizing, the return-to-office requirements haven’t been pervasive enough to start turning things around yet, because most companies are holding onto their hybrid or remote schedules, said Ashley Lane, senior vice president at brokerage Perry CRE. Then there’s the broader impact on Boston’s struggling downtown. Michael Nichols, president of the Downtown Boston Business Improvement District, says foot traffic is on track to rise 4 percent from last year, with a pickup seen in the second half of 2024 as more return-to-office requirements kick in after a slow start. But traffic is still considerably short of prepandemic levels, particularly on Mondays and Fridays. He pointed to numbers from data analytics firm Placer.ai that show weekday commuting traffic in Boston at 58 percent of prepandemic levels, close to the average of the top 25 cities in the country. Nichols has been positioning the downtown to be less reliant on office commuters, but they are still critical to the district’s health. “The core concern I heard two years ago was that companies didn’t want to be isolated in their return-to-office [approach] and that they could lose talent to someone who is allowing more days at home,” Nichols said. “Now I think that fear is eroding.” However, for every office employer that increases its requirement, there are others keeping the status quo, based on the Globe’s inquiries to local companies in recent weeks. Liberty Mutual remains at two days a week, while MassMutual and John Hancock are at three. Attendance is sparser at health insurers Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Point32Health. On the other end of the spectrum, Wayfair started requiring corporate employees to return four days a week (tech workers could opt for three) last year, as did State Street, though neither seems poised to go further. The bottom line for Boston: The city now has the widest spectrum of return-to-office requirements since the term first started being used, early in the pandemic. That said, few companies are expected to match Amazon’s extreme position, at least for now. “I appreciate their boldness [but] I think four days a week is going to be the high and three days a week will be the low,” said John Dolan, managing director for New England at brokerage Avison Young. “It all depends on the type of industry, but three to four seems like the sweet spot.” Veolia is among the local employers entering that sweet spot. Starting in January, Veolia office employees will be expected to show up three days a week, up from two currently. (Most field workers already work in person all five days by necessity.) In Boston, the change coincides with a move of the headquarters to a smaller office in the Financial District. Veolia North America chief executive Fred Van Heems said he unveiled this new plan in part to address employees who felt disengaged during the pandemic. Also, onboarding newcomers, particularly younger workers, is easier when they have more time in person with their more experienced peers. “It’s a lot easier to convey joy when you have people around you, than through screens,” Van Heems said. “It’s good for us as a company and for the people individually, and important for the collective mental health that we have more human interactions.” At Akamai Technologies in Cambridge, though, executives are taking a different approach. In mid-2022, Akamai allowed nearly all employees the option to work in person, at home, or a hybrid of the two. They get to decide based on where they feel they’re most productive. Akamai chief human resources officer Anthony Williams said the company has seen an average 25 percent increase in the number of applicants per open job since adopting the policy and a 40-plus percent drop in attrition (although it has also announced three rounds of layoffs since the pandemic began). “We believe this is a differentiator for us as a company,” Williams said of Akamai’s policy. “We’re a company that operates on the internet. What greater way to show the power of the internet than showing we can be successful in operating in a virtual environment.” Meanwhile, entrepreneur Gogi Gupta is taking an “office first” approach that essentially requires people to come into the office four days a week, or five if they just joined and are learning the ropes, to enhance employee retention and culture. Gupta, who employs about 80 people in Boston at his marketing firm Gupta Media, enacted a policy called “Flex 48″ at the start of the year, a reference to the number of days in the year they can work from home. “There’s a number of people who don’t apply to work here, and that’s all right,” Gupta said. “The extroverts and the people who believe in collaborative work and enjoy an office environment, they’re very excited.” Be civil. Be kind. ©2024 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC Stay up to date with everything Boston. Receive the latest news and breaking updates, straight from our newsroom to your inbox.

Crypto isn’t in the depths of a bear market, and your cousin doesn’t think you’re a crook anymore. Now crypto is ascending again—and everyone wants financial advice, just like Thanksgiving from three years ago. Below is a compiled list of handy talking points for your crypto-curious relatives, covering the industry’s most significant, recent developments. Stick to the facts, avoid shilling meme coins to the elderly, and you’ll be cruising to pie in no time. Bitcoin came within a few hundred bucks of the vaunted $100,000 milestone last week, and while the price has retreated a bit recently, it returned above $97,000 earlier Wednesday. What’s driving the demand that’s pushed Bitcoin’s price record in recent weeks? Institutional and retail investors have expressed optimism that there will soon be a more favorable regulatory climate for digital assets in the U.S. That’s thanks to the victory of self-proclaimed crypto enthusiast Donald Trump, along with the election of the most pro-crypto Congress to date. Meanwhile, institutional investors’ forays into spot Bitcoin ETFs have also given traders reason to be optimistic, pumping up the price of Bitcoin over the year. In short, Bitcoin is more “legit” than ever in the eyes of Wall Street and politicians. Your folks may have heard that BlackRock and Fidelity—which may be managing their pensions—are now involved in Bitcoin. What are these two Wall Street giants doing with crypto? Well, you can explain: They swallowed the orange pill. OK, so you probably don’t need to use Crypto Twitter jargon. Still, you can tell them that traditional finance bigwigs now offer exposure to the two largest digital assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Thanks to long-awaited SEC approvals this year, top fund managers who manage different ETFs now let ordinary investors buy shares that track the price of the two via brokerage accounts. Even your technophobic aunt can down the orange pill with a couple of taps on her phone. On the campaign trail this year, Trump made lots of promises about lots of things, including crypto. And while it remains to be seen whether he will live up to many of those commitments, signals are already indicating that he may be holding up the crypto end of the bargain—which could be a massive development for the industry. First things first: last week, the president-elect nominated Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary. Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager, has indicated he’d back Trump’s proposal to establish a Bitcoin federal reserve. The plan would see the U.S. buy billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin to diversify its reserves. Think of it this way: If your uncle says Bitcoin has no real value, you might soon be able to tell him the U.S. government backs the asset. Pair that with Trump’s plans to unwind the SEC’s aggressive crypto crackdown completely, plus his oath to get the Republican-controlled House and Senate to approve laws that would firmly legalize most crypto activity swiftly, and it’s no wonder crypto has exploded in recent weeks. Experts say the market still has much, much higher to climb in the coming months, too. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, now has a role in Trump’s government: The Tesla CEO will lead the Department of Governmental Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) with billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy to supposedly clear up the bureaucracy. What’s that got to do with crypto, though? Well, the new department’s acronym matches the ticker of Dogecoin, the original and most meme coin. That’s probably not a coincidence. Elon Musk has for years spoken—and tweeted—about how it’s his favorite coin. This earned him the “Dogefather” title on Twitter, now called X, after he acquired the platform. While we can’t be 100% sure of the naming origins, Trump is selling a DOGE-themed t-shirt featuring himself, Musk, and a Shiba Inu—the mascot of Dogecoin. Don’t want to decide between Bitcoin or Ethereum? If you’d instead launch your own token, you can now do it much more efficiently than ever. One of the most significant innovations from the most recent crypto cycle has been the creation of token launchpads, or platforms that allow anyone to near-instantly create a token with a few clicks and for a few cents worth of crypto. The most notable launchpad, Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform, has given rise to some of the most memorable tokens from this cycle. Nearly four million tokens have been created on Pump.fun this year, ranging from animal tokens that have provided early traders with significant riches to those launched by crypto-curious celebrities like musician Iggy Azalea. Crypto’s adoption barriers keep getting knocked down. Consumers now have a wide breadth of mobile app options to buy, sell, and interact with a variety of platforms. Plus, the rise in smart wallets, which drastically simplify the onboarding process, is making it easier to get those previously intimidated by the technical complexities of crypto to participate on-chain. With the launch of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, those looking to gain crypto exposure have more traditional financial options. That option didn’t exist in the U.S. last Thanksgiving. Are you looking to dive head-first into crypto? Not so fast—you’ll first want to get your sea legs. The crypto industry is rife with scams, and a seemingly innocuous link to an airdrop could lead you to a wallet drainer: Say goodbye to all your coins! Even if you manage to keep your crypto out of scammers' grips, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to keep your holdings from going to zero. Not many people make money trading crypto, and much fewer are getting rich off of it. Up to 80% of day traders lose money over time, according to a report published in The Journal of Finance. It’s still incredibly easy to lose your shirt in crypto, whether by clicking a malicious link or betting on highly volatile coins. For newcomers, you’re probably best suited to sticking to the most significant coins via apps like Coinbase, Robinhood, Cash App, or buying into ETFs. Want to go deeper? Be very careful—you’ll be thankful in the long run.

Title: Stock market today: Indexes slide as tech sell-off ends 7-day winning streak

US stocks ended lower on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P 500 snapping a seven-day winning streak amid a sell-off in tech. Major averages tumbled after hitting records in Tuesday's session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 100 points and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%. Bond yields were lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield down five basis points to 4.248%. Tech led the declines on Wednesday. Dell shares dropped as much as 12% after the company cut revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. In a call with investors after reporting earnings on Tuesday, Dell called AI a "robust opportunity" for its business but warned that the path would "not be linear," sparking concern over spending in the artificial intelligence space. Mega-cap tech stocks declined during the day, with Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta all ending lower. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday: Markets also took in personal consumption expenditures price data for October, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Core PCE inflation grew 2.8% year-per-year, slightly hotter than last month, but in line with economists' expectations. Investors ramped up their bets for coming Fed rate cuts, despite earlier concern that central bankers could take a slower approach to easing monetary policy. Odds for a 25 basis point rate cut in December jumped to 70%, though most traders doubt the Fed will follow with another quarter-point cut in January, according to the CME FedWatch tool. "This is a nice Black Friday gift for the Fed," Scott Helfstein, the head of investment strategy at Global X, said in a note. "The inflation numbers came in as expected, accelerating slightly from recent readings, but still very close to the Fed target. This is not likely to alter the Fed rate path and another 25 bp cut in December is still likely." Other market commentators, though, say the path forward is still uncertain. "Today's data shouldn't change views of the likely path for disinflation, however bumpy. But a lot of observers, probably including some at the Fed, are looking for reasons to get more hawkish on the outlook given the potential for inflationary policy change like new tariffs," David Alcaly, the lead macroeconomic strategist at Lazard Asset Management, said in a note.

While it's typically the stocks at the top of the semiconductor food chain, such as the AI GPU designer whose shares are up 740% since ChatGPT was made public or the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer responsible for making AI GPUs or processors for Apple, that catch the media and public attention, the semiconductor industry is made of a plethora of other firms as well. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry comprises firms upstream and downstream of the chip supply chain. Starting from the former category, these semiconductor stocks start from those that provide design intellectual properties and hardware used to manufacture chips. Moving further downstream, semiconductor fabrication firms such as the Taiwanese firm whose American Depository Receipts (ADRs) have gained 133% since ChatGPT's public unveiling started to play a role. Finally, the downstream chip supply chain is made of designers who sell the products and others who assemble chips into the hardware needed for their proper functioning. To invest in semiconductor stocks, an investor needs to know which supply chain category a stock belongs to. This is because industry dynamics often have a varying effect on stocks at different rungs of the supply chain. Additionally, when we talk about downstream stocks, then the markets that they cater to also play a role in the share price performance. Stocks that are upstream are affected by broader industry trends and find it difficult to benefit from sector-specific tailwinds such as artificial intelligence. As an illustration, consider the performance of three upstream semiconductor stocks. The first stock ranks 7th on the list of 15 AI stocks shaping Wall Street, the second is 19th on Goldman Sachs' list of top growth investors, while the third ranked 12th and was losing popularity among institutional investors according to Bank of America. The first two stocks are up 16% and 4% over the past twelve months while the third is up by a more modest 1%. Compared to the Philadelphia semiconductor stock index, a widely followed industry benchmark that has gained 32.2% over the same period, all three semiconductor stocks have underperformed. A brief look at the three stocks' business model sheds light on the reasons behind their lackluster performance. Starting from the worst stock whose shares are up by 1%. The firm provides semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as those used in wafer cleaning, etching, and film deposition. This means that it has exposure to the broader and non-AI sectors of the downstream semiconductor industry as well. Additionally, during its fiscal year 2024, 42% of the firm's revenue came from the memory industry. These chips run parallel with integrated circuits in computers, and their demand has been depressed recently and only started to recover in mid-2024. It also has exposure to China, and semiconductor tensions between the US and China haven't boded well for the stock either. Similarly, the semiconductor stock that is up 16% over the past year also has notable exposure to China. During the nine months ending in July 2024, 40% of its revenue came from China. Yet, for the three months ending in July, this percentage dropped to 32% as US government restrictions against American chip firms from supplying products to China continued to affect it. This semiconductor firm provides products such as plasma abatement systems, epitaxy systems, film deposition systems, and etching masks. As a result, even if there are no US-Chinese tensions, the fact that China's economy and industrial production have slowed naturally reduces the demand for its products. On the downstream end of the semiconductor supply chain, there is a clear bifurcation between AI and non-AI stocks, or those with exposure to integrated circuits and GPUs, and those with no exposure. To understand how to consider two stocks of firms that manufacture semiconductors. The first is the Taiwanese firm which we've mentioned above. Its ADRs are up 87.2% year-to-date. The second ranks 16th on our BofA list shared above, and its shares are down 14.5% year-to-date. Starting from the former, during the third quarter, 51% of the firm's revenue came from high-performance computing (HPC) products. These chips are involved in data centers, enterprise computing, and other workloads, and they also have wide exposure to the artificial intelligence industry. This firm also manufactures AI GPUs for Wall Street's favorite GPU designer, and the culmination of its end markets coupled with the fact that its 3-nanometer manufacturing process is an industry leader has seen investor optimism surge surrounding its fortunes. On the flip side, the semiconductor stock whose shares are down 14.5% has little exposure to HPC and AI chips. As of H1 2024, 53% of the firm's $3.7 billion revenue came through products that it sold to the automotive industry. This firm is known for selling chips manufactured through silicon carbide. These chips are used to manage power in electric vehicles, and as EV demand has slowed down in 2024, investors have fled the stock in response. The semiconductor stock hasn't been helped by the fact that slowing industrial activity led to a 21% industrial revenue drop during H1. As should be clear by now, semiconductor stocks come in all flavors. One such flavor, when analyzing them through share prices, is the penny stock segment. These stocks belong to smaller companies that do not have sizable revenue to power their valuation. Yet, penny stocks, when prudently considered, also often have the chance for stronger returns due to their low prices. On the flip side, these stocks are prone to market manipulation, and since they're not as frequently covered by analysts or the media, understanding the fundamental drivers of their share price is complex. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some semiconductor penny stocks. Our Methodology To make our list of the best semiconductor penny stocks, we ranked semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks under $5 by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a technician's hands working on an advanced semiconductor substrate. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 10 AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) is an upstream semiconductor firm that primarily makes and sells substrates. These products are used to manufacture chips on them, and AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI)'s substrates revolve around communications, solar, robotics, and other associated applications. The stock has been on quite a ride this year. It fell by 37% in April after a research report alleged that the firm was facing tight financial conditions. AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI)'s shares continued their downward momentum in November, as they fell by another 18% following a third-quarter revenue miss. While the firm raked in $23.6 million in revenue during Q3, analysts had expected it to bring in $25.5 million. Even though AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) is based in California, 99% of the firm's long-term assets are in China. Additionally, 50.6% of the firm's H1 2024 revenue came from the East Asian country, which creates a double-edged sword. While AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) can benefit from renewed Chinese focus on its domestic industry, the firm might also be caught in the crosshairs of geopolitical tensions between the US and China. AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI)'s management shared details about the state of its Chinese market during the Q3 2024 earnings call: "Overall, the market recovery is somewhat lumpy, particularly given the weak economic conditions in China. But new fiscal stimulus in China announced in September could provide a catalyst for a truly market environment. This will benefit demand across a broad based of applications, including power amplifiers, HPT applications for wireless switches, high-speed power industrial labels, and LEDs. We continue to be encouraged by our relatively new traction in HPT applications by bringing the learning from our product that’s advancing in our 8-inch gallium arsenide development to our 6-inch gallium arsenide wafer production." Overall AXTI ranks 5th on our list of the semiconductor penny stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AXTI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AXTI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Gensler Exit Signals End To Climate Reporting Rule And ESG In The SEC

Time Published: 2024-11-27T19:19:11Z
Full Content:
Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), following a Financial ... [+] Stability Oversight Council meeting at the Treasury Department in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, May 10, 2024. Photographer: Samuel Corum/Bloomberg Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saw a wave of regulatory and enforcement actions relating to environmental, social, and governance; sustainability; and climate change. Gensler’s resignation as Chair of the Commission not only signals a new direction for the agency but will most likely result in many green initiatives being rolled back. The result will frustrate climate activists but may give U.S. businesses a strategic advantage in the global market. Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions. On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms, like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces. This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives. In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was initially set to go into effect in 2026. However, it was immediately met with legal challenges and the SEC delayed implementation indefinitely while the cases worked through the judicial process. A series of companion rules and initiatives were also implemented during the same period. The SEC created a Climate and ESG Enforcement Task Force in March 2021 to “develop initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct.” The SEC quietly disbanded the Task Force in September 2024. In April 2021, the SEC Division of Examinations issued a Risk Alert relating to ESG. The Division conducts exams, their terminology for reviews of SEC filings of publicly traded companies and investment funds for compliance with regulations. They also issue periodic Risk Alerts making companies aware of areas of focus and concern. The April 2021 alert showed a new focus on ESG and stayed an annual priority until 2023, when it was quietly omitted. It returned in a November 4 Risk Alert that addressed ESG claims made by funds. This aligns with the Names Rule, amended in September 2023, to take into consideration ESG. Under the rule, funds with phrases related to environmental, social, or governance factors, including climate and sustainability, will be forced to align 80% of the investment with those names. This is most likely the reason why ESG was removed from priorities in 2023 and is now reemerging, as it gave funds time to adjust to the new rule. In 2024, the SEC penalized a number of high-profile funds for failure to comply with the rule. Under Gensler, the SEC has also introduced other initiatives relating to ESG, including a focus on the composure of boards and internal policies. The future of these initiatives is in question with Gensler’s exit. Traditionally, the Chair of the SEC tenders their resignation following a presidential election, even when they have time left in their term. This allows the incoming administration the ability to make their own selection for the role. As expected, Gensler, a Democrat that served under Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Biden, submitted his resignation on November 21, effective the end of Biden’s term. With Gensler’s exit, there will be a notable shift in priorities for the incoming chair. At the Workiva Amplify Conference in September, David Peavler, a former attorney for the SEC and current partner at Jones Day, addressed the impacts of the then potential change. He stated he believes that the Trump Administration will either drop or repeal the climate rules. Looking at the overall direction of the SEC, he believes there will be shift away from new initiatives and rulemaking, as has been the case under Gensler, and a refocus on enforcement. While ESG was a still relatively unknown concept during Trump’s first term, the Department of Labor did take action to limit its impact. In 2019, the DOL issued a rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that found the consideration of ESG by fund managers was a violation of their fiduciary duty. The Biden Administration partially reversed the DOL ERISA opinion in 2021, stating that ESG may be considered as a factor, but only as a tiebreaker if both investment opportunities offer identical returns. Expect a similar approach under the next Trump Administration. The next SEC chair will most likely methodically undo the ESG and climate related reporting standards imposed under Biden and Gensler. The SEC will refocus on traditional financial consideration, effectively killing ESG at the national level. Although, companies will still have to comply with international regulations and state level requirements. This may give U.S. businesses a strategic advantage in the global market. Concerns have been rising in the European Union that their corporate sustainability reporting requirements are harming the EU economy. Following the June 2024 Parliament elections, the incoming leadership has stated their intent to reduce the “regulatory burden” on businesses, including consolidating three key pieces of climate related regulations. Other jurisdictions have imposed costly reporting requirements under the IFRS Sustainability Standards. Climate activists argue the the costs are not only worth it, but are necessary to reduce the impacts of climate change in a shift towards a “climate economy.” However, the Trump administration has stated clear opposition to the concept and business as usual. The removal of the SEC sustainability/ ESG focus will allow U.S. businesses to continue to focus entirely on profits, giving them a competitive edge, at least in the short term. One Community.

While Nvidia’s (NVDA) shares have tripled in value so far this year, its shares dropped more than 10% in the week after it reported fiscal third-quarter earnings. The chipmaker’s shares were down by about 2.3% during Wednesday afternoon trading and was down by almost 10.4% over the past five days. After the company reported record fiscal third-quarter earnings last week, Nvidia’s shares fell by almost 3.5% in after-hours trading. The decline continued the following morning, with the stock dropping around 1%. Despite beating revenue estimates for another straight quarter, Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — only slightly above what analysts were expecting. The stock slide deepened Monday, when Nvidia’s shares dropped by more than 4% after Reuters (TRI) reported that the company’s executive vice president of Worldwide Field Operations Jay Puri had met with Chinese vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen in Beijing. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to raise tariffs on Chinese imports by 60% or more when he takes office in January, recently adding that he would impose an additional 10% tariff “on all of their many products coming into the United States of America” until China stops the flow of fentanyl and other drugs into the US. These proposed tariffs could spark retaliatory measures from Beijing, with Chinese state media warning Tuesday that “there are no winners in tariff wars.” China remains a crucial market for Nvidia, accounting for about 17% of the company’s revenue in the year ending January 2024, down from 26% two years earlier due to existing US export restrictions. The company’s latest China-specific chip, the H20, is projected to generate over $12 billion in sales this year, according to research group SemiAnalysis. Meanwhile, the outgoing Biden administration is expected to announce new export controls on China as early as next week, Reuters reported, that could target hundreds of Chinese chip companies. The U.S. has already imposed several trade restrictions to prevent U.S. firms, including Nvidia, from exporting U.S.-made technology to China.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/27/2024 10:29:08 AM PST by DFG A groundbreaking lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas accuses financial giants BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street of colluding to manipulate the U.S. coal market. The case, spearheaded by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and supported by 10 other state attorneys general, alleges that these firms have used their substantial ownership stakes in major coal producers to suppress competition and artificially raise energy prices. The states listed as plaintiffs are” Texas Alabama Arkansas Indiana Iowa Kansas Missouri Montana Nebraska West Virginia Wyoming According to the 108-page complaint, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street collectively hold controlling stakes in multiple coal companies, including Peabody Energy and Arch Resources, which account for significant portions of U.S. coal production. The suit alleges that these firms formed an “output-reduction syndicate,” leveraging their shareholder influence to force coal companies to cut production, ostensibly in alignment with environmental goals like the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. The complaint details how these firms’ actions have allegedly suppressed coal supply despite rising demand for electricity. The result? Skyrocketing coal prices and increased costs for consumers at a time when many are already grappling with inflation. (Excerpt) Read more at thegatewaypundit.com ...

Title: BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard sued by GOP states over ESG goals

BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard have been sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states, which said the large asset managers violated antitrust law through climate activism that resulted in reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. Wednesday’s complaint filed in the federal court in Tyler, Texas, is among the highest profile lawsuits targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals, or ESG. The defendants were accused of exploiting their market power and involvement in climate advocacy groups to pressure coal companies to slash output and reduce carbon emissions from coal by more than 50% by 2030, driving up consumers’ utility bills. “Competitive markets — not the dictates of far-flung asset managers — should determine the price Americans pay for electricity,” the states said in the complaint. Larry Fink’s BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard together have more than $26 trillion of assets under management. None of the companies immediately responded to requests for comment. The 11 states also include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. Republicans have long explored using US antitrust laws to target alleged collusion among large fund managers to advance climate-related goals. Climate advocates, in contrast, view assessing environmental risks as essential to assessing what investments are worth. The states objected to BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard allegedly pressuring coal companies for change starting in 2021. They also criticized the defendants’ membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which says members are committed to complying with all antitrust laws, and BlackRock’s and State Street’s membership in Climate Action 100+. Vanguard left the Net Zero initiative in 2022, while BlackRock and State Street left Climate Action 100+ in February. But the states said the withdrawals did not negate the “ongoing and future threat” of continued pressure. It cited the defendants’ investments in nine coal companies, including combined respective stakes of 34.2% and 30.4% in Arch Resources and Peabody Energy, the largest publicly traded UuS coal producers. BlackRock was also accused in the lawsuit of “actively deceiving” investors about its non-ESG funds by promising to dedicate them to enhance shareholder value, when it allegedly used all its holdings to advance its climate goals. The lawsuit seeks to block BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard from using their investments to vote on shareholder resolutions and take other steps that could undermine coal output and limit market competition. It also seeks civil fines for violating federal antitrust and Texas consumer protection laws. The case is Texas et al v BlackRock Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, No. 24-00437. Advertisement

Joining the now live Amazon Black Friday Week Deals as well as the official Google sale, the Samsung Black Friday bonanza is now offering some wild price drops on its latest foldables. You’ll find the Galaxy Z Flip 6 at $350 off and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 with a wild $800 in savings on select colors to join these new microSD card offers. We are also tracking new all-time low Samsung’s 2024 Odyssey G9 curved gaming monitor with a massive $520 in savings alongside a host of other battlestation displays, not to mention the lowest price to date on the flagship 2024 ANC OnePlus Buds Pro 3 with the vegan leather case. Everything else awaits down below in today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: While we already brought you the details on the now live OnePlus Black Friday sale, we are stepping back out today to highlight the all-time pricing it is providing on the brand’s 2024 model OnePlus Buds Pro 3 at $119.99 shipped. Regularly $180, outside of getting bundled in with some of the brand’s smartphones and tablets over the last few months (and right now for Black Friday), straight up cash deals on its latest flagship buds have been light at best. We have never seen them drop below $149 over at Amazon either. Scope out some additional details below. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. As part of its Black Friday Week Deals, Amazon is offering up to 40% off a range of the popular YETI tumblers and travel mugs as well as a host of the brand’s coolers, and more. Prices kick off from $17.50 with free shipping for Prime members or in orders over $35. You’ll find Black Friday YETI deals on everything from its wine tumblers and mugs to stainless steel insulated Rambler bottles in various sizes and form-factors, alongside a host of coolers and the like. All of the YETI Black Friday deals are waiting for you right here and you’ll find some picks from the sale down below. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. Update: While the Samsung site is still offering the $150 price drops below, Amazon is now undercutting those offers on the more affordable 128GB model with deals from $474.99 – this is the lowest price we have tracked to date. As part of its early access Black Friday sale that serving up the best price to date on the new Tab S10 configurations, another one of Samsung’s latest releases is hitting its lowest price to date. While there are some notable trade-in options for the new, more affordable Samsung S24 FE smartphone, the straight cash deals have never been better than they are today. Amazon is still offering all-time lows starting from $574.99, but going directly to Samsung will net you an instant credit that will drop the spend down to the $499.99 all-time low on the 128GB model and the best price yet on the 256GB variant at $559.99 shipped. Details await below. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Xiaodi Hou, the co-founder and former CEO of self-driving truck startup TuSimple, is demanding that the board immediately liquidate the company and return all remaining funds — roughly $450 million — to shareholders “on a pure pro-rata basis, regardless of share class,” according to a letter that TechCrunch has viewed. Hou is also suing TuSimple and his former co-founder Mo Chen, the company’s chief producer and director, to confirm that a 2022 voting agreement granting Chen control over TuSimple expired in November 2024, which Hou says would revert his voting rights back to him. Hou has even created a website, SaveTuSimple.com, to raise awareness about his campaign to liquidate TuSimple and return cash to shareholders — which include Traton Group, BlackRock, and Vanguard. The site states that as of November 26, TuSimple’s stock trades at $0.24 per share, while holding $1.93 per share in cash alone. It advertises that through liquidation, TuSimple shareholders “can immediately realize this 700%+ premium to current market price.” The letter, lawsuit, and campaign are the latest flare-ups in an ongoing fight between TuSimple and some of its shareholders, which include Hou, over the company’s attempts to send its remaining assets to China. Before shuttering its U.S. operations and delisting from the stock market earlier this year, TuSimple was a pre-revenue company, so any cash it has today would have come from investors. Hou and other shareholders have accused TuSimple’s leaders of diverting assets toward animation and gaming businesses linked to Chen, framing it as a business pivot. After shareholders raised concerns of self-dealing in an August letter to the board, TuSimple surprised many by unveiling a new AI-generated animation and gaming unit. Earlier this month, Hou urged a California district court to issue a temporary restraining order on TuSimple to stop the company from transferring U.S. assets to China as part of an existing shareholder lawsuit. Hou said he was galvanized to action after noticing filings that he says signaled TuSimple was preparing to transfer large sums of money to China. TuSimple has fought back against Hou, bringing up its own litigation alleging trade secrets theft after Hou launched his autonomous trucking startup, Bot Auto, in Texas last month. “As a founder who invested seven years building TuSimple Holdings Inc. and its largest shareholder, it has been disappointing to watch shareholders’ collective investment value plummet by over 91% in less than two years under the leadership of Mo Chen … and Chairman and CEO Cheng Lu,” Hou wrote in the letter, which he sent to the board on Monday. Hou filed suit against TuSimple and Chen last week in the Delaware Chancery Court, which is known to be friendly to shareholder rights. In the filing, he also asked the court to postpone TuSimple’s upcoming annual shareholder meeting, which is currently scheduled for December 20, to “prevent the implementation of proposed significant governance changes before the voting rights dispute is resolved.” Sources familiar with the matter say Hou wants time to solicit proxies to get more investors on his side. Aside from Hou and Chen, TuSimple’s largest shareholder, with an 11.8% stake, is Sun Dream, an affiliate of Chinese conglomerate Sina Corporation, an investment that brought scrutiny from federal regulators. The remaining large shareholders are Logistics giant Traton (7.6% stake); Vanguard Group (6.1% stake); BlackRock (5.6% stake); and Camac Partners (5.5% stake). Camac has also written to urge the board to keep TuSimple’s funds in the U.S. The other three investors did not respond in time to TechCrunch to comment. But before Hou can convince shareholders to back him, he’ll need to get control over his own shares, which are the subject of his lawsuit. In the fall of 2022, a probe from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States led TuSimple to reveal that its employees spent paid hours in 2021 working for Hydron — Chen’s hydrogen trucking startup based in China — and shared confidential information with the company. As a result, Hou was ousted from his posts as CEO, president, and CTO, and from his position as chairman of the board, though he retained a seat on the board. Hou has maintained that the firing was done without just cause. He and Chen were concerned that the board was engaged in a power grab that wasn’t in TuSimple’s best interest, so they discussed combining their voting powers to reinstate Chen on the board and bring Hou back as CTO after an internal investigation about the Hydron allegations. (Hou never got his CTO post back.) On November 9, Hou signed an agreement with Chen that would give the latter “irrevocable proxy and power of attorney” over Hou’s shares in TuSimple: Around 13.4 million shares of Class A common stock, and 12 million shares of Class B common stock. Put together, Hou’s shares would account for 29.7% of TuSimple’s total voting power. The agreement, which TechCrunch has viewed, expired after two years. Hou says this means the shares should revert back to him. But Chen has other ideas. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated November 9, 2024, Chen reaffirmed his claim to Hou’s shares, stating that he controls 57.9% of the company’s voting power. The filing also states that while the irrevocable proxy indeed terminated, “the voting agreement, and the voting arrangement thereunder, remain in full force and effect.” In other words, while Hou may be in possession of the shares, he still needs to vote as Chen directs. (It’s worth noting that since voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January, TuSimple has failed to file quarterly updates, which are required for a company that is still registered with the SEC. TuSimple is also attempting to deregister from the SEC.) TuSimple included similar language around the deal with Hou in its proxy statement to shareholders ahead of the upcoming annual meeting, during which they will vote on renewing the six current directors and whether to create a classified board, or a staggered board. Half of the board’s current makeup is TuSimple executives: Chen; TuSimple CEO Cheng Lu; and TuSimple COO Jianan Hao. The other three — James Lu, Zhen Tao, and Albert Schultz — are meant to be independent directors. If the second proposal were to pass, it would prevent shareholders from replacing the entire board in a single vote and it could entrench control with Chen, who would effectively be ensuring his preferred directors stay in place for the long term. A hearing to expedite the review of Hou’s complaint and to decide on his request to postpone TuSimple’s annual meeting is scheduled for December 2.

Half of the board’s current makeup is TuSimple executives: Chen; TuSimple CEO Cheng Lu; and TuSimple COO Jianan Hao. The other three — James Lu, Zhen Tao, and Albert Schultz — are meant to be independent directors. If the second proposal were to pass, it would prevent shareholders from replacing the entire board in a single vote and it could entrench control with Chen, who would effectively be ensuring his preferred directors stay in place for the long term. A hearing to expedite the review of Hou’s complaint and to decide on his request to postpone TuSimple’s annual meeting is scheduled for December 2.

Title: Elon Musk's demands for Nvidia's AI chips strained its supply

Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s aggressive pursuit of artificial intelligence chips for his supercomputer has pushed Nvidia (NVDA) to its production limits. In an email to colleagues, a sales lead at the chipmaker said the billionaire’s demand for its chips was straining its supply chain, the Wall Street Journal (NWS) reported, citing the email it viewed. “We’ve worked hard to meet the needs of all customers and have greatly expanded the available supply today,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with Quartz. In September, Musk announced that his AI startup, xAI, had brought its Colossus training cluster online after only 122 days. Colossus, which he called “the most powerful AI training system in the world,” is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 training chips. Musk said the cluster “will double in size” “in a few months” to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 units. While AI rivals including OpenAI and Meta (META) also have hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s chips, Colossus has the most processors of an individual AI computing cluster in the world. During an Oracle (ORCL) investor event in September, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said he and Musk spent a dinner “begging” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang for more of Nvidia’s AI chips. “Please take our money. No, no take more of it. We need you to take more of our money. Please,” Ellison said about the conversation. “It went okay. It worked.” xAI’s supercomputer will be used to train the next generation of xAI’s large language model (LLM), Grok, which is meant to rival OpenAI’s GPT-4. In May, the AI startup raised $6 billion from heavyweight investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. The Series B funding round pushed xAI to a $24 billion valuation. Earlier this month, it was reported that xAI is set to raise another $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: 2 Unicorn Lessons From Mark Zuckerberg: Navigate VCs & Master Pivots

Lessons from Mark Zuckerberg (Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty ... [+] Images) Mark Zuckerberg’s journey offers invaluable lessons for entrepreneurs. He has built a unicorn by starting Facemash, building Facebook, and transforming it into Meta. His journey offers invaluable lessons on achieving sustained success and building growth ventures —and how you can apply these principles to your own entrepreneurial journey. Billion-dollar entrepreneurs achieve their success by entering emerging trends before they take off – then dominating them. Zuckerberg entered the Internet 2.0 era during the rise of social networking and dominated it. Zuckerberg’s ability to recognize the emerging potential of social networking gave him a foothold in an industry primed for explosive growth. His strategy mirrors that of other billion-dollar entrepreneurs who leveraged the potential of emerging industries: · Medical Electronics: Earl Bakken co-founded Medtronic and capitalized on the emerging medical electronics industry (Bootstrap to Billions). · Big-Box Retail: Sam Walton (Walmart) and Dick Schulze (Best Buy) capitalized on the growth of big-box retailing. · Personal Computers: Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Michael Dell (Dell) shaped the emerging PC industry. · Telecommunications: Ralph Roberts (Comcast) pioneered cable TV when it was emerging. · Internet 1.0: Early Internet pioneers like Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com), and Page and Brin (Google) laid the foundation for today’s digital economy. · Internet 3.0: Entrepreneurs like Brian Chesky (Airbnb) and Travis Kalanick (Uber) disrupted traditional industries through the sharing economy. First movers often stumble because they must flawlessly execute every aspect of the venture. Smart followers, however, can often refine and improve an idea, launch and pivot as needed, then scale it effectively. Zuckerberg exemplifies this. Like 89% of ultimate winners, Zuckerberg succeeded not by being a first mover but by being a smart follower and an even smarter pivoter and builder. His ability to learn and pivot was key to Facebook’s domination and its transformation into Meta. Here are the strategic pivots that helped Zuckerberg succeed. Zuckerberg’s journey highlights the importance of entering an industry early – even when the landscape is hazy. Nearly all Unicorn-Entrepreneurs got in when the industry was emerging and pivoting to the right strategy. Zuckerberg entered the emerging Internet-linking industry space using Facemash. When he was introduced to the Facebook concept by three Harvard students, Zuckerberg pivoted to create Facebook. By initially targeting elite universities, he differentiated Facebook from direct competitors like Rupert Murdoch’s MySpace, and won. Zuckerberg’s decision to acquire Instagram was pivotal to Facebook’s path to social media dominance. Initially hesitant, he pivoted quickly when Instagram secured $50 million in VC at a $500 million valuation. Recognizing Instagram’s potential, he closed the deal at $1 billion within days – a bold move that solidified Meta’s dominance in social media. Zuckerberg invested heavily in augmented reality, spending significant time and money on the Metaverse concept and acquiring Oculus Rift for a few billion dollars. But when artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a transformative force, he pivoted Meta’s focus to AI-driven solutions, boosting both sales and the company’s stock price. Zuckerberg can pivot because he controls more than 50% of Facebook’s voting rights even though he owns less than 30% of the company. Zuckerberg demanded proxies from VCs to maintain control. By keeping control, Zuckerberg ensured that VCs did not second-guess his strategy or his leadership. If entrepreneurs want to lead with independence, Zuckerberg’s example highlights the importance of structuring deals to retain control. 94% of billion-dollar entrepreneurs leveraged skills and finance-smart strategies to avoid VC or delay it. This allowed them to keep control. Zuckerberg is a prime example. He first honed his tech skills to enter an emerging trend and was offered $1 million to improve the software he had developed as a teenager. Besides technical skills, entrepreneurs must also develop startup skills, pivoting skills, and growth skills. MY TAKE: Zuckerberg offers a masterclass in building a unicorn by pivoting to leverage trends and adapting strategies effectively. He can do so because he retained control over Facebook and over the VCs to avoid VC-interference. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq slide after key Fed inflation gauge shows faltering progress

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks dipped Wednesday as investors digested fresh data that showed inflation made little progress toward the Fed's 2% target in October. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off about 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down roughly 0.6%. The mood is muted in the wind-down to the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see markets shut on Thursday and close early on Friday. But the Fed is taking the fore again after being eclipsed somewhat by the debate over the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans and Cabinet choices. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations but above the 2.7% seen in September. Traders currently see a roughly 34% chance the Fed holds rates steady at that meeting, up from about 24% a month before, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Also out Wednesday, the second estimate of third quarter GDP was unchanged, showing the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the period. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims continued to move lower with 213,000 unemployment claims filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from 215,000 the week prior. Trump on Tuesday tapped Jamieson Greer — a veteran of his first term — as US trade representative. Given Greer was heavily involved in Trump's original China tariffs, Wall Street is assessing what his role could mean for the big new tariffs promised for the top US trading partners. On the corporate front, Dell (DELL) shares sank over 12% after quarterly revenue fell short amid flagging PC demand. Peer HP's (HPQ) stock also fell post-earnings, also down more than 11%. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While a holiday-shortened market day on Friday still separates investors from a fresh month of trading, December is nearly here. And Carson group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 of 10 times. In more recent history, since 2000, the index has risen in every December after the strong rally to start the year. The rally in the world's largest cryptocurrency returned on Wednesday afternoon. After surging near $100,000 last week, bitcoin (BTC-USD) had been quieter this week. But late Wednesday, bitcoin quickly moved higher from a low of $91,804 to a high of $97,357. While traditional markets will be closed for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, bitcoin's $100,000 watch will roll on. Mortgage rates edged lower as financial markets reacted to President-elect Donald Trump’s slate of Cabinet picks. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped slightly to 6.81% in the week from 6.84% a week earlier. Interest rates have been hovering in the 6.8% area for four weeks straight. The 15-year mortgage rate rose to 6.1%, compared with 6.02% a week prior. “Rates have been relatively flat over the last few weeks as the market waits for more clarity on specific economic policies,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports: President-elect Donald Trump has been quick to promise new tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. But his threats, if carried out, potentially threaten to upset inflation and investment and disrupt the broader economic cycle. New duties on imports could reverse some of the hard-won progress on inflation that the Federal Reserve is still struggling to maintain. Meanwhile, making it more expensive to import goods from the nation's neighbors to the north and south may also widen the trade deficit, weighing on investments elsewhere. Read more here. Recent inflation prints have shown little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, showed prices rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with the reading from the September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, above the 2.7% seen the year prior. And as our chart below shows, the short-term trend hasn't painted a better picture either. Over the past three months, core PCE has risen at annualized rate of 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% goal. While key inflation readings from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) for November loom before the Fed meets again in mid-December, the current inflation data has some economists questioning if the central bank will pause interest rate cuts soon. "Core PCE has been going sideways for the last couple of months," Paul Gruenwald, S&P Global Ratings global chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. "If you think the Fed is on a declining rate path, which we do, that's probably leaning toward the pause [cutting interest rates] camp." Gruenwald added that the Fed won't be in a hurry to cut rates unless it sees a "more convincing decline" in core PCE. Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped more than 3% on Wednesday, weighing on the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). Shares in the AI chip giant are off about 9% in the past five days as investors have digested the company's latest quarterly earnings release. Other tech stocks were lower on Wednesday, including Dell (DELL). The company's stock fell more than 10% following its quarterly earnings release. In a call with analysts, Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said AI spending "will not be linear." Fewer Americans are filing for unemployment benefits. But that doesn't mean companies are hiring. New data released by the Department of Labor on Wednesday showed that jobless claims hit a seven-month low in the week ending Nov. 23, with 213,000 initial claims filed. That's down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. "We are in a 'low-hire, low-fire' environment," Bank of America's lead economist Aditya Bhave said in a note on Tuesday. "In the spring of 2022, there were two open jobs for every unemployed person. Now that figure is just a little more than one. In other words, there aren’t as many opportunities out there." Recent data has supported that trend, confirming a gradual slowdown of the labor market. Job openings for the month of September fell to their lowest level since January 2021 while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, also dropped to 1.9% from a revised 2% in August. In one bright spot, layoffs have remained low with the unemployment rate still hovering at a healthy 4.1%. "A spike in layoffs would create a negative feedback loop between consumption and the labor market," Bank of America's Bhave said. "For now though, the layoff rate is below pre-pandemic levels, consistent with the low level of unemployment insurance claims." "So while the labor market has moderated," Bhave said, "It hasn’t rolled over!" Read more here. Dell Technologies (DELL) shares dropped more than 13% early Wednesday after the company took a cautious approach to its forecast for investors while warning that AI growth "will not be linear." "AI is a robust opportunity … and interest in our portfolio is an all-time high with no signs of slowing down," Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said during a call with investors Tuesday night following the company's earnings report for the October period. "That said, this business will not be linear, especially as customers navigate an underlying silicon road map that is changing." Dell's AI server revenues fell 9% in the third quarter from the prior period. That nonlinear growth, coupled with a slower-than-expected recovery in the PC market, led the company to drop the midpoint of its guidance range for annual revenue to $96.1 billion from $97 billion since last quarter. Still, Dell executives and analysts pointed to pent-up demand for Dell's AI servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips. Read more about Dell's most recent earnings results and its role in the AI market here. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations and above the 2.7% seen in September. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.3%, a pickup from the 2.1% seen in September. Read more here. Another Wall Street strategist sees a solid backdrop for the US economy and a broadening corporate earnings picture driving stocks higher in the year ahead. JPMorgan's global equity strategy team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hitting 6,500 by the end of 2025, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who issued the same target. The target represents about an 8% increase from current levels. Lakos-Bujas wrote that continued "US exceptionalism," continued earnings growth, and interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve will be a tailwind for stocks in the year ahead. He argued the US is likely to remain the "global growth engine with the business cycle in expansion, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-related capital spending, and prospect of robust capital market and deal activity." He added, "heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the evolving policy agenda are introducing unusual complexity to the outlook, but opportunities are likely to outweigh risks. The benefit of deregulation and a more business-friendly environment are likely underestimated along with potential for unlocking productivity gains and capital deployment." US stocks paused near record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for a reading on the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge to provide clues to the path of interest rates. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.2% at the open while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down about 0.3%. The October print of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, is due for release on Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. ET. The focus is on whether inflation has stalled. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week, and hit a seven-month low, as the impact of labor strikes and severe weather continued to abate. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 9,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Elsewhere in economic data, the second estimate of third quarter GDP came in unchanged, once again showing the US economy grew at annualized rate of 2.8%. Economic data: Personal income & spending (October); MBA mortgage applications (Nov. 22); GDP annualized (third quarter second estimate); Wholesale inventories (October); Initial jobless claims, (week ending Nov. 23); Pending home sales Earnings: No notable earnings releases.

GM lost 9%, while Ford dropped 3% as both companies have a strong presence in Mexico. But automakers aren't the only companies that stand to be hurt by tariffs, of course. Think computers and T-shirts! Here's what HP Inc. (HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) CEO Fran Horowitz told me on the tariff topic. Enrique Lores "Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be." Fran Horowitz "When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge. In 2024 we will not be receiving more than 5% or 6% of our US receipts from China. We're taking a look at it country by country, but the agility that we've built into our supply chain is really what's going to help us manage through this." Sign in to access your portfolio

The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations but above the 2.7% seen in September. Traders currently see a roughly 34% chance the Fed holds rates steady at that meeting, up from about 24% a month before, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Also out Wednesday, the second estimate of third quarter GDP was unchanged, showing the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the period. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims continued to move lower with 213,000 unemployment claims filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from 215,000 the week prior. Trump on Tuesday tapped Jamieson Greer — a veteran of his first term — as US trade representative. Given Greer was heavily involved in Trump's original China tariffs, Wall Street is assessing what his role could mean for the big new tariffs promised for the top US trading partners. On the corporate front, Dell (DELL) shares sank over 12% after quarterly revenue fell short amid flagging PC demand. Peer HP's (HPQ) stock also fell post-earnings, also down more than 11%. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While a holiday-shortened market day on Friday still separates investors from a fresh month of trading, December is nearly here. And Carson group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick reminds us that in markets, strength often begets strength. Dating back to 1985, when the S&P 500 rallied more than 20% entering December, the benchmark index has risen further 9 of 10 times. In more recent history, since 2000, the index has risen in every December after the strong rally to start the year. The rally in the world's largest cryptocurrency returned on Wednesday afternoon. After surging near $100,000 last week, bitcoin (BTC-USD) had been quieter this week. But late Wednesday, bitcoin quickly moved higher from a low of $91,804 to a high of $97,357. While traditional markets will be closed for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, bitcoin's $100,000 watch will roll on. Mortgage rates edged lower as financial markets reacted to President-elect Donald Trump’s slate of Cabinet picks. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped slightly to 6.81% in the week from 6.84% a week earlier. Interest rates have been hovering in the 6.8% area for four weeks straight. The 15-year mortgage rate rose to 6.1%, compared with 6.02% a week prior. “Rates have been relatively flat over the last few weeks as the market waits for more clarity on specific economic policies,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement.

But his threats, if carried out, potentially threaten to upset inflation and investment and disrupt the broader economic cycle. New duties on imports could reverse some of the hard-won progress on inflation that the Federal Reserve is still struggling to maintain. Meanwhile, making it more expensive to import goods from the nation's neighbors to the north and south may also widen the trade deficit, weighing on investments elsewhere. Read more here. Recent inflation prints have shown little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, showed prices rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with the reading from the September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, above the 2.7% seen the year prior. And as our chart below shows, the short-term trend hasn't painted a better picture either. Over the past three months, core PCE has risen at annualized rate of 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% goal. While key inflation readings from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) for November loom before the Fed meets again in mid-December, the current inflation data has some economists questioning if the central bank will pause interest rate cuts soon. "Core PCE has been going sideways for the last couple of months," Paul Gruenwald, S&P Global Ratings global chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. "If you think the Fed is on a declining rate path, which we do, that's probably leaning toward the pause [cutting interest rates] camp." Gruenwald added that the Fed won't be in a hurry to cut rates unless it sees a "more convincing decline" in core PCE. Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped more than 3% on Wednesday, weighing on the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). Shares in the AI chip giant are off about 9% in the past five days as investors have digested the company's latest quarterly earnings release. Other tech stocks were lower on Wednesday, including Dell (DELL). The company's stock fell more than 10% following its quarterly earnings release. In a call with analysts, Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said AI spending "will not be linear." Fewer Americans are filing for unemployment benefits. But that doesn't mean companies are hiring. New data released by the Department of Labor on Wednesday showed that jobless claims hit a seven-month low in the week ending Nov. 23, with 213,000 initial claims filed. That's down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. "We are in a 'low-hire, low-fire' environment," Bank of America's lead economist Aditya Bhave said in a note on Tuesday. "In the spring of 2022, there were two open jobs for every unemployed person. Now that figure is just a little more than one. In other words, there aren’t as many opportunities out there." Recent data has supported that trend, confirming a gradual slowdown of the labor market. Job openings for the month of September fell to their lowest level since January 2021 while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, also dropped to 1.9% from a revised 2% in August. In one bright spot, layoffs have remained low with the unemployment rate still hovering at a healthy 4.1%. "A spike in layoffs would create a negative feedback loop between consumption and the labor market," Bank of America's Bhave said. "For now though, the layoff rate is below pre-pandemic levels, consistent with the low level of unemployment insurance claims." "So while the labor market has moderated," Bhave said, "It hasn’t rolled over!" Read more here. Dell Technologies (DELL) shares dropped more than 13% early Wednesday after the company took a cautious approach to its forecast for investors while warning that AI growth "will not be linear." "AI is a robust opportunity … and interest in our portfolio is an all-time high with no signs of slowing down," Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said during a call with investors Tuesday night following the company's earnings report for the October period. "That said, this business will not be linear, especially as customers navigate an underlying silicon road map that is changing." Dell's AI server revenues fell 9% in the third quarter from the prior period. That nonlinear growth, coupled with a slower-than-expected recovery in the PC market, led the company to drop the midpoint of its guidance range for annual revenue to $96.1 billion from $97 billion since last quarter. Still, Dell executives and analysts pointed to pent-up demand for Dell's AI servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips. Read more about Dell's most recent earnings results and its role in the AI market here. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations and above the 2.7% seen in September. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.3%, a pickup from the 2.1% seen in September. Read more here. Another Wall Street strategist sees a solid backdrop for the US economy and a broadening corporate earnings picture driving stocks higher in the year ahead. JPMorgan's global equity strategy team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hitting 6,500 by the end of 2025, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who issued the same target. The target represents about an 8% increase from current levels. Lakos-Bujas wrote that continued "US exceptionalism," continued earnings growth, and interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve will be a tailwind for stocks in the year ahead. He argued the US is likely to remain the "global growth engine with the business cycle in expansion, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-related capital spending, and prospect of robust capital market and deal activity." He added, "heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the evolving policy agenda are introducing unusual complexity to the outlook, but opportunities are likely to outweigh risks. The benefit of deregulation and a more business-friendly environment are likely underestimated along with potential for unlocking productivity gains and capital deployment." US stocks paused near record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for a reading on the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge to provide clues to the path of interest rates. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.2% at the open while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down about 0.3%. The October print of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, is due for release on Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. ET. The focus is on whether inflation has stalled. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week, and hit a seven-month low, as the impact of labor strikes and severe weather continued to abate. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 9,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Elsewhere in economic data, the second estimate of third quarter GDP came in unchanged, once again showing the US economy grew at annualized rate of 2.8%. Economic data: Personal income & spending (October); MBA mortgage applications (Nov. 22); GDP annualized (third quarter second estimate); Wholesale inventories (October); Initial jobless claims, (week ending Nov. 23); Pending home sales Earnings: No notable earnings releases.

Enrique Lores "Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be." Fran Horowitz "When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge. In 2024 we will not be receiving more than 5% or 6% of our US receipts from China.

Title: Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard sued by Republican states over climate accords
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackrock-state-street-vanguard-sued-by-republican-states-over-climate-accords-3744622

By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) -BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) have been sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states, which said the large asset managers violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. Wednesday's complaint filed in the federal court in Tyler, Texas, is among the highest profile lawsuits targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals, or ESG. The defendants were accused of exploiting their market power and involvement in climate advocacy groups to pressure coal companies to slash output and reduce carbon emissions from coal by more than 50% by 2030, driving up consumers' utility bills. "Competitive markets -- not the dictates of far-flung asset managers -- should determine the price Americans pay for electricity," the states said in the complaint. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street together have more than $26 trillion of assets under management. In a statement, BlackRock said any suggestion it invested in coal producers to harm them was "baseless and defies common sense. This lawsuit undermines Texas' pro-business reputation and discourages investments in the companies consumers rely on." Vanguard and State Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The 11 states also include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. Republicans have long explored using U.S. antitrust laws to target alleged collusion among investment managers to advance climate-related goals. Climate advocates, in contrast, view assessing environmental risks as essential to determining what investments are worth. BIG STAKES IN COAL COMPANIES The states objected to BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street allegedly pressuring coal companies for change starting in 2021. They also criticized the defendants' membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which says members are committed to complying with all antitrust laws, and BlackRock's and State Street's membership in Climate Action (WA:ACT) 100+. Vanguard left the Net Zero initiative in 2022, while BlackRock and State Street left Climate Action 100+ in February. But the states said the withdrawals did not negate the "ongoing and future threat" of continued pressure. It cited the defendants' investments in nine coal companies, including combined respective stakes of 34.2% and 30.4% in Arch Resources and Peabody Energy, the largest publicly traded U.S. coal producers. BlackRock was also accused in the lawsuit of "actively deceiving" investors about its non-ESG funds by promising to dedicate them to enhance shareholder value, when it allegedly used all its holdings to advance its climate goals. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office filed the lawsuit, in a statement accused the defendants of promoting an "illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized 'environmental' agenda." The lawsuit seeks to block the defendants from using their investments to vote on shareholder resolutions and take other steps that could undermine coal output and limit market competition. It also seeks civil fines for violating federal antitrust and Texas consumer protection laws. The case is Texas et al v BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, No. 24-00437.

Title: SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Gen 3 review: a super-solid analog gaming keyboard with top performance

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Steelseries Apex Pro TKL Gen 3 is a brilliantly made gaming keyboard with delectable performance, thanks to its well-engineered analog switches. The tweaks available courtesy of the accompanying software are great too, although the lack of controller emulation is a shame. The price of entry is steep too, but if you’re looking for superb feel and a durable build, the Apex Pro fits the bill brilliantly. Great performance Well made Good software Expensive Unergonomic wrist rest Lacking analog tweaks Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. The Steelseries Apex Pro TKL Gen 3 is a premium gaming keyboard with analog switches, designed to provide the most accurate and tweakable gaming experience possible. It certainly looks the part: its understated appearance doesn’t scream gaming prowess, but when you peer further, the quality is evident from every angle. The chassis is relatively thick but not as weighty as you might expect, and it feels solid and expertly put together, easily among the best gaming keyboards around. The same is true of the wrist pad and the stock double-shot PBT keycaps, which have a slight but smooth texture that’s satisfying to touch. The inbuilt Smart Screen sits in the top right corner, and can be used to select profiles, change the global actuation point and toggle Rapid Trigger. It can also be customized to display information pertaining to your system or popular games and apps. You can even upload your own images and GIFs too. Further customizations can be made via Steelseries peripheral software, GG. Here, you can tinker with the actuation points further, on a global or key-by-key basis. You can also set functions to trigger on press or release, and add two binds to a single key, with each triggered at different actuation points of your choosing. It’s a shame, though, that GG provides no visual feedback when making such adjustments, and there’s no option to emulate the joysticks or triggers of a controller, as can be done on some other analog keyboards, such as the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro. However, the gaming performance of the Apex Pro makes up for this omission. The switches are extremely responsive yet offer enough feedback to make hitting actuation points easy. The relatively compact layout also makes the bottom row accessible, as does the sloped nature of these keys. All keycaps are also nicely indented, making for secure presses. The only gripe I have is with the short, flat wrist rest, which caused my palm to hang off the edge when in the WASD position. I didn’t find the Apex Pro to be as amenable for typing. However, I generally prefer shallow keycaps to glide around on, so those who prefer thicker keycaps may have no issue here. The Apex Pro is expensive, costing the same as the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro, another analog offering. But with the high price tag comes supreme build quality and performance, and although it misses out on a few analog tweaks, it’s still well worth your consideration. The Apex Pro TKL Gen 3 costs $219 / £209 (about AU$336) and is available now. It comes in one colorway, black. It also includes a wrist rest and a keycap puller, with Steelseries selling replacement keycaps on its website. Unsurprisingly, it’s less expensive than the wireless variant, which costs $269 – but as well as ditching the wires, that model offers multiple connectivity modes, meaning you can easily switch it between multiple devices. The Apex Pro is certainly towards the top end of the wired gaming keyboard market. It’s the same price as the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless, for instance, which uses Hall-effect analog technology as well. That board can also be tweaked using Razer Synapse, the brand’s excellent, feature-packed peripheral software. If you’re after a more budget-friendly analog keyboard, then the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro is a possible contender. Unlike the Apex Pro, it offers controller emulation, although its switches aren’t as precise as we would’ve liked for this purpose. Even though it has its issues, it’s still one to consider. Value: 3 / 5 The Apex Pro is a fairly imposing slab, with a thick yet sleek chassis, and its muted looks belie its gaming intentions; the RGB lighting is about the only giveaway in this regard. The build quality is where the Apex Pro really stands out, though. It’s quite weighty, although not as heavy as you might expect, but every material and joint is exquisite. There’s also a handy compartment underneath housing the keycap puller, with a rubber flap to close it that works well. The double-shot PBT keycaps feel premium to the touch, with a slight yet smooth texture. The overall layout is reasonably compact, but I didn’t have any issues with mispresses. The Apex Pro also features Steelseries’ own modifier key, called the Meta key. This allows you to perform various shortcuts, such as adjusting the actuation point and selecting profile slots. Such alterations can also be made via the Smart Screen. This uses a black and white OLED display, with navigation controlled via a scroll wheel and a small button below – both of which are just as well engineered as the rest of the Apex Pro. You can set the global actuation point from anywhere between 0.1mm and 4mm, and toggle Rapid Trigger. The Smart Screen can also be used to display certain system information, including workloads for the CPU, GPU and RAM, which is very useful. In-game information can be displayed too, with many popular games having their own default layouts, including those for Counter-Strike 2, Minecraft, and League of Legends. You can even upload your own images and GIFs to display. Further actuation settings can be adjusted in SteelSeris’ GG software. You can change the actuation of individual keys, and set keys to trigger on press or release. There’s also a dual actuation mode, letting you bind two functions to a single key, each triggered at certain actuation points of your choosing. Other rebinding options include those for common shortcuts, media playback and system-level functions, although there aren’t as many on the latter front as some other peripheral tools offer. You can also customize the information the Smart Screen displays with a pleasing amount of depth and detail, selecting the timings for when certain information is displayed and what triggers it. In Counter-Strike 2, for example, you can view your health, as well as your K/D ratio at the end of each round. As well as games, some apps are also integrated, such as Discord, which can display messages. Overall, GG is easy to navigate and responsive. One aspect that is disappointing, though, is the lack of visual feedback when adjusting settings, which would’ve been useful when setting actuation points to see how your inputs actually translate in real time. Design & features: 4 / 5 Put simply, the Apex Pro is a joy to use. The damping of the switches is superb, feeling incredibly satisfying to use while still being snappy enough for fast movements. The indentations of the keycaps also makes them secure and easy to use, and the bottom row is easy to hit with your thumb and little fingers, thanks to the slope of these keys and the aforementioned compact layout. Hitting certain actuation points is also much easier than I’ve experienced with other analog keyboards, as there’s enough feedback to get a good feel as to how far down you’ve pressed. Rapid trigger also works brilliantly, letting you make those twitchy movements even quicker, by dynamically raising the actuation point when repeated presses are registered. My chief nag from an ergonomic standpoint, though, is with the wrist rest. Given the aforementioned thickness of the Apex Pro’s chassis, I found the rest was definitely needed. However, since it’s quite short and provides very little slope, I found that the edge of my palm would hang awkwardly off the end when in the WASD position. Also, when it comes to typing, I didn’t find the Apex Pro to be easiest to use. However, I should say that I mostly prefer shallow, laptop-style keyboards, as I find them easier to glide around on, which the stock keycaps on the Apex Pro are not particularly conducive to. But if you’re someone who prefers thicker keycaps for typing, then you’ll likely not have an issue here. Performance: 4.5 / 5 You want precise analog controlThe analog switches are a dream, providing plenty of feedback for accurate actuation-point hitting. You want the best gaming performanceAside from that analog control, the switches are snappy when needs be, so there’s no gaming situation that catches it out. You want to use it with multiple devicesSince there’s only a wired connection, you can’t easily hotswap between multiple devices, as you can with the wireless variant. You want to emulate a controllerDespite the analog switches, you can’t emulate controller joysticks or triggers (not natively anyway). Razer Huntsman V2 AnalogIf you have your heart set on an analog keyboard, then the Razer Huntsman V2 Analog is a worthy choice (it’s our pick as the best gaming keyboard around, after all). With its excellent performance and myriad of customization options courtesy of Razer Synapse, you can’t go far wrong with this board. And since the release of version 3, the V2 can be found for a good price. Read our Razer Huntsman V2 Analog review. SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3For $50 more, you can get the wireless version of the Apex Pro TKL, which helps to eliminate the clutter from your desk, and allows you to do some sofa gaming too. And since it features Bluetooth and wired options in addition to the 2.4GHz dongle, you can use it with multiple devices and switch between them with ease. I tested the Apex Pro for several days and used it to game, work, and browse. I used both with and without the included wrist rest. I played games such as Counter-Strike 2, which is a great test for a keyboard’s responsiveness and accuracy. I also made sure to try out as many features as possible, and tinker with as many settings as I could using the GG software. I have been PC gaming for over a decade, and I have used plenty of keyboards during that time. I have also reviewed a number of keyboards with varying price tags, sizes, and switch types.

Title: There is no such thing as an all-America car. That’s why tariff will raise car prices. | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to protect American-made cars through steep tariffs on imports. The problem is, there is no such thing as an all-American car. Trump has promised that tariffs, which are a tax on goods that are imported from another country, will be a key part of his economic plan in his second term. On Monday he announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on all goods coming from Mexico or Canada on his first day in office. The US government tracks what percentage of each car’s parts is made “domestically.” But under current trade law, both Canadian-made parts and US-made parts are counted as the same domestic content. Even with the broader definition of “American made,” none exceed 75%. That’s why auto prices could rise sharply if Trump goes ahead with plans to impose steep tariffs on the parts that go into the “American” vehicles found in showrooms nationwide. The auto industry supply chain depends on parts and materials from around the globe – from relatively inexpensive nuts and bolts that are cheaper to buy from foreign producers, to expensive computer chips and other electronic components that aren’t made in sufficient quantities in US factories to meet demand. But despite his claim that tariffs are paid by the foreign country, they are in fact paid by whoever is buying the imported good, and US businesses almost always pass most – or all – of that cost onto consumers. The North American car industry has operated for decades as if the continent is one giant country, thanks to free trade agreements signed by presidents from Bill Clinton to Trump himself. Parts and whole vehicles have flowed freely across borders, sometimes multiple times, before they end up in an American dealership. But Trump is promising to change that. Because of the threat of tariffs on both Canadian and Mexican exports to the United States, shares of most automakers’ stocks fell Tuesday, with GM closing down 9%, Ford down 3%, Stellantis, the maker of cars under the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands, off 6%. In addition Toyota closed off 2% in US trading, and Honda fell 3%. Trump’s plans would upend the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the three-country trade deal he negotiated. Mexico and Canada are two of America’s largest trading partners, and are currently exempt from most tariffs under the USMCA, but that that could change. And it’s not just tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada that are raising concern. Trump’s promise to increase tariffs are China an additional 10% beyond existing measures have the potential to make plenty of cars more expensive, too. While China ships relatively few cars to the United States, it is a major source of low-priced auto parts. Trump argues that the move would bring jobs back to the United States by forcing manufacturers to close plants in other countries and open or expand US plants. But the amount of parts that go into cars assembled here would be difficult for American suppliers to replace, which would make building a car at US auto plants much more expensive. There are only two vehicles hit that are considered to be 75% American-made by the US government – the Tesla Model 3, and the Honda Ridgeline, a pickup assembled at a Honda plant in Lincoln, Alabama. And once again, that 75% includes any content that currently comes from Canada, and could be subject to new tariffs. Almost all of the vehicles that have 50% or more of their content from US or Canadian suppliers are either built by Tesla or brands that are ostensibly “foreign,” but actually assemble cars here – Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan, Mazda, Subaru and Toyota. The Ford F-150, the most popular vehicle in the United States for more than 40 years, has the most domestic content of any vehicle made by one of the traditional “Big Three” automakers. While the all the parts are assembled into a pickup truck in either Michigan or Missouri, only 45% of those parts come from US or Canadian factories. Many of the larger versions of its engines come from Mexico. “Yes, it’s America’s truck, assembled in America, but not with American parts,” Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds, told CNN. Finding domestic supplies for many of the imported car parts would be difficult. Even if some are made here, there is not enough excess capacity to replace production of the parts now being imported. And for some of the less expensive goods, it’s not economical to make them at US factories, paying US wages. It would be more economical to pay the tariffs, and pass along the cost to car buyers. Even if an American parts supply could be found, in most cases it would be more expensive. The low price of imports is the reason automakers turned to those supplies in the first place. And spending the time and money to build new plants, assuming suppliers are willing and able to do so, would pose its own challenges. Take the multitudes of computer chips that go into modern cars, for example, which control everything from fuel economy to windshield wipers to lumbar support and seat warmers. The 2022 CHIPS Act approved $30 billion to support building 16 semiconductor factories in the United States. But even with all of that money, it can take three to five years to build new plants. Related article What could get more expensive if Trump launches a new trade war with Mexico and Canada Even modernizing and expanding existing US chip plants, which would need to take place in order to meet increased domestic demand if imported chips become more expensive due to tariffs, could take a year or more. One New York plant that’s being expanded is expected to take 10 years to fully realize its additional production levels. The tariffs would raise the cost of assembling vehicles at US plants. And those increased costs would definitely hit car buyers who are already spending nearly $50,000 on each new vehicle purchased here. “Those costs … are not going to be absorbed by the automakers or suppliers,” Jeff Schuster, global vice president of automotive research at consultant GlobalData, told CNN. Automakers had no comment when asked about their plans and the impact on prices due to new tariffs when contacted by CNN. Even if Trump pulls back on tariff plans and only imposes tariffs on fully-assembled cars imported into the United States, it will raise the price of cars built here, let alone on those imports. During the campaign he vowed 100% to 200% tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico, saying it was vital to protect American auto jobs, although he made no reference to those plans in Monday’s announcement. That would double or triple the cost of those cars, likely killing all demand for them. He predicted there would be a “bloodbath” in the US auto industry and auto jobs if his tariff plans weren’t imposed. Related article Trump ups the ante on tariffs, vowing massive taxes on goods from Mexico, Canada and China on Day 1 If tariffs do in fact raise the price of Mexican-assembled vehicles, like the Chevrolet Blazer or Honda HR-V, and subsequently price them out of the the market, automakers might decide to stop offering them altogether rather than build them at US factories. Cars built in Mexico are most often lower priced, lower profit models, that are only able to maintain their profitability by being built with cheaper Mexican labor. But it’s not just smaller, entry-level models that are built in Mexico that could see price hikes. The tariffs could impact many models car buyers don’t realize are imports, such as the heavy duty versions of Ram pickup trucks, which are built in a Stellantis plant in Saltillo, Mexico. Some versions of the Chevrolet Silverado are also built in Mexico. Even if the automakers shift production of those more profitable vehicles back from Mexico to US factories, it would take years to accomplish the switch. Tariffs on imported vehicles likely would also lead to higher prices on cars that are assembled here, since it would limit the supply of vehicles in the US market. When supply is limited and demand remains strong, rapid price increases are often the result, which is what happened in 2021 and early 2022 when a shortage of computer chips and other parts severely restricted production across the industry. Almost all car buyers were suddenly paying above sticker price for the first time, and average prices soared. And the higher prices on imports would mean less competition for manufacturers making cars and trucks at US plants, giving them the chance to charge more in order to increase profits - not necessarily hire more workers. US automakers have used strong profits in recent years to repurchase billions of dollars worth of their shares to support their stock price, even as they were laying off workers and slowing or trimming production in some cases. “It will have a ripple effect throughout the market, and fallout on all vehicles,” said Drury. “You’re going to disrupt the used car market as well.” The exact impact will be difficult to determine until final details of Trump’s tariff plans are spelled out. During his first term there were numerous threats of tariffs that never came to pass. Drury said that some of the tariff talk from the campaign trail might not happen this time either. If they do, it will have a huge impact on car buyers. “There are all these potential car buyers who have held out because of high prices,” said Drury. “If these tariffs are put in place, it could tank the industry. I hope for the car buying public, nothing is as aggressive as advertised.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Nvidia once again posted a $2 billion beat to consensus revenue estimates in Q3, reporting YoY growth of nearly 94% to over $35 billion in revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled in the quarter to over $30 billion with Hopper driving the second largest data center beat in company history, speaking volumes as to the level of demand for its GPUs given that Blackwell will not initially ship until next quarter. As recapped to our premium members after the earnings report, the I/O Fund is tracking supply chain signals indicating the next generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined.

When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. Beating on data center revenue is becoming common place for Nvidia, yet what’s interesting is the data center segment posted the largest surprise relative to estimates since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. A bar graph illustrating Nvidia’s impressive revenue performance, showcasing a $35.08 billion ... [+] revenue surpassing the consensus estimate of $33.13 billion. This marks the largest data center segment beat since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24, highlighting Nvidia’s consistent outperformance in the data center sector. Data center revenue of $30.77 billion increased 112.0% YoY and 17.1% QoQ, beating estimates by $1.95 billion. This marked the largest beat since the $2.46 billion beat in Q2 FY24, as well as the two $1.8 billion beats in Q3 FY24 and Q1 FY25. This is important as this beat was driven solely by Hopper – which is in its seventh quarter with the H100s and H200s. Blackwell’s is expected to ramp quickly in Q4 and into next year. Analysts estimate Blackwell’s volume in Q4 could be between 150,000 and 200,000, before tripling sequentially to 550,000 in Q1 FY26 (Jan-Apr quarter of 2025). The expectation for AI clusters is to go from tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands, to millions of GPUs, indicating a long runway for Blackwell and subsequent GPU generations. What’s shaping up for 2025 is the convergence of multiple strong tailwinds for Nvidia to capture via Blackwell: GPU clusters this generation beginning at the upper end of Hopper’s hundred-thousand clusters, Big Tech capex continuing to increase past one quarter trillion (which we covered two weeks ago), and more importantly, Blackwell’s pricing power versus Hopper. Q3 earnings aside, this bigger picture is that Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU sales next year will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 — combined. 2025 is shaping up to be potentially the most important year for Nvidia since I first highlighted Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis in my free stock newsletter in November 2018 and when the I/O Fund entered at $3.15 for returns of 3,280%. Including Q4’s estimate, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion to $130 billion in data center revenue in 2023 and 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone. Back in August, in the analysis Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings, I wrote: ‘According to reports from Wccftech: “Team Green is expected to ship 60,000 to 70,000 units of NVIDIA's GB200 AI servers, and given that one server is reported to cost around $2 million to $3 million per unit, this means that Team Green will bag in around a whopping $210 billion from just Blackwell servers along, that too in a year. The weight of that report cannot be overstated as it implies 26% upside to 2025’s estimates based on one SKU alone.” Despite Blackwell not yet shipping in full volume, there are multiple data points that support this ramp to $200+ billion in revenue. Perhaps the most important quote was one that could easily be overlooked — Nvidia’s management explained in Q3’s earnings that they have “completed a successful mask change for Blackwell…that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.” Since both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem beginning in Q4, there’s more emphasis on supply constraints moving forward, as management was clear in saying that both products have “certain supply constraints” with Blackwell’s demand “expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.” Broadly speaking, supply constraints are nothing new as it’s been widely understood Blackwell is already sold out for next year. By executing this mask change to improve production yields, Nvidia can theoretically get more usable chips per wafer, alleviating some supply fears and allowing it to meet higher demand levels, leading to higher revenue generation. Management already hinted at this, saying “we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated.” CEO Jensen Huang also explained that GPU clusters with Blackwell will be starting where Hopper left off: “You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells.” Even though Nvidia guided Q4 nearly in-line with analysts' expectations at $37.5 billion, there is still significant room for Blackwell to grow through 2025. Current forecasts point to revenue surpassing the $50 billion-mark one year from now, with revenue growth in excess of 40% for the next five quarters. A table displaying the wide range of analyst revenue estimates for Nvidia in FY26, highlighting a ... [+] $40 billion range for Q3 and a $70 billion range for Q4. The potential for Nvidia to achieve over $50 billion in quarterly data center revenue is also noted. Interestingly, there is still a massive disconnect in analyst estimates as FY26 progresses – estimates for Q3 have a nearly $40 billion range from the low to high estimates. When looking at Q4 of next year, there is a ridiculous $70 billion range, with some analysts predicting $31 billion at the low end while others have estimates as high as $101 billion. Should Nvidia maintain its quarterly cadence of beating by $2 billion from the midpoint of these estimates, and assuming data center mix remains at ~90%, Nvidia could easily exit FY26 with data center revenue at >$50 billion/quarter, or $200+ billion annualized compared to data center revenue of $140 billion this year. Big Tech’s capex supports this revenue growth story, as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet have all accelerated capex significantly in the past couple of quarters and reaffirmed the need to continue investing aggressively in AI infrastructure moving through 2025. Additionally, Big Tech is already spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s Blackwell lineup: This is but a fraction of 2025’s estimated capex– 2024’s capex could come in at ~$240 billion with an estimated $70 billion spent in Q4, with the four currently tracking for over $270 billion in capex predominantly for AI infrastructure in 2025. Nvidia has been capturing a lion’s share of AI spending from Big Tech, at ~80% to 85%, and assuming little change in its AI GPU market share with competition primarily arising from AMD and no one else, Big Tech’s spending implies a clear path towards $200 billion in GPU revenue in 2025. The importance of Big Tech’s capex was also echoed with the CEO stating we will see $1 trillion in data infrastructure rebuild before he expects to see digestion from the hyperscalers. Per Huang: “I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers.” That would imply another 3X from here for the remaining three-quarter trillion – not in stock price, but in capex. Presumably, it would mean a higher trajectory for the stock price in terms of valuing that revenue. Hopper drove another beat, which Nvidia is becoming widely known for. It’s rare for analysts to openly expect large beats going into a print, yet UBS had correctly tagged the beat this quarter at $2 billion. However, due to declining from peak revenue growth of 265% earlier this year, Hopper-driven growth of 94% is not what will drive the stock up for the next leg higher. Nvidia investors, such as myself, will need Blackwell’s pricing power and Blackwell’s clear demand signals to re-invigorate the stock. Nvidia reported 93.6% YoY growth, more than 10 points higher than consensus estimates for ~83% YoY growth. Nvidia is now lapping its peak growth quarters, Q4 FY24 and Q1 FY25, where revenue peaked at 265% growth due to Hopper ramping tremendously fast. Growth technically is decelerating nearly 30 points in Q3 and growth will further decelerate nearly 24 points next quarter, but to be reporting above 93% YoY and almost 70% YoY versus 200-260%+ growth comps is still a very strong report to say the least. A graph illustrating Nvidia’s year-over-year growth rates, showing a deceleration from peak growth ... [+] of 265% to current growth of 94%. The graph highlights Nvidia’s consistent beats against analyst estimates, driven by Hopper, and the anticipated future impact of Blackwell. For Q4, management guided for revenue of $37.5 billion, +/- 2%, just slightly ahead of consensus estimates for $37.02 billion at the midpoint. Analysts are now expecting $38.01 billion in revenue for Q4, just a week after the report, at the upper end of the guided range. Both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem moving forward as Blackwell ramps significantly through fiscal 2026. Analysts were nitpicking margins, yet this concern is overblown. Q3’s margins were relatively in line with guidance despite the $2 billion top-line beat, and for Q4, management forecast margins to contract nearly 2 points sequentially. However, CFO Colette Kress was clear that following Blackwell, gross margin will eventually return to its current percentage: “As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.” Investors should never underestimate Wall Street’s ability to miss the bigger picture. Analysts on the call cross-examined this 200 bp sequential decline despite Nvidia having an operating margin of over 60% compared to most of the Mag 7 having operating margins at half that. It’s also completely normal for semiconductors to feel margin pressures in the initial stages of ramping a new product, especially at this scale and pace. A chart showing Nvidia’s operating margins, highlighting the anticipated 2-point sequential decline ... [+] in Q4 and the projected return to mid-70s gross margins with the ramp-up of Blackwell. The chart emphasizes Nvidia’s strong current margins compared to industry peers. The bigger picture for Nvidia moving forward is that Blackwell holds the potential to dwarf Hopper’s revenue generation in fewer quarters. Breaking it down further on CNBC, I stated Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power I had been quite vocal prior to earnings that Q3’s report was nothing but a blip in the longer-term picture, with 2025 being much more important than this quarterly report. The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The I/O Fund has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pull back, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from the semiconductor industry and meaningfully breakout.

When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The I/O Fund has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pull back, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from the semiconductor industry and meaningfully breakout. The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche, with 9 buys and real-time alerts from 2021 to 2022 below $20.

Nvidia once again posted a $2 billion beat to consensus revenue estimates in Q3, reporting YoY growth of nearly 94% to over $35 billion in revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled in the quarter to over $30 billion with Hopper driving the second largest data center beat in company history, speaking volumes as to the level of demand for its GPUs given that Blackwell will not initially ship until next quarter. As recapped to our premium members after the earnings report, the I/O Fund is tracking supply chain signals indicating the next generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined.

(Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. Beating on data center revenue is becoming common place for Nvidia, yet what’s interesting is the data center segment posted the largest surprise relative to estimates since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. A bar graph illustrating Nvidia’s impressive revenue performance, showcasing a $35.08 billion ... [+] revenue surpassing the consensus estimate of $33.13 billion. This marks the largest data center segment beat since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24, highlighting Nvidia’s consistent outperformance in the data center sector. Data center revenue of $30.77 billion increased 112.0% YoY and 17.1% QoQ, beating estimates by $1.95 billion. This marked the largest beat since the $2.46 billion beat in Q2 FY24, as well as the two $1.8 billion beats in Q3 FY24 and Q1 FY25. This is important as this beat was driven solely by Hopper – which is in its seventh quarter with the H100s and H200s. Blackwell’s is expected to ramp quickly in Q4 and into next year. Analysts estimate Blackwell’s volume in Q4 could be between 150,000 and 200,000, before tripling sequentially to 550,000 in Q1 FY26 (Jan-Apr quarter of 2025). The expectation for AI clusters is to go from tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands, to millions of GPUs, indicating a long runway for Blackwell and subsequent GPU generations. What’s shaping up for 2025 is the convergence of multiple strong tailwinds for Nvidia to capture via Blackwell: GPU clusters this generation beginning at the upper end of Hopper’s hundred-thousand clusters, Big Tech capex continuing to increase past one quarter trillion (which we covered two weeks ago), and more importantly, Blackwell’s pricing power versus Hopper. Q3 earnings aside, this bigger picture is that Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU sales next year will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 — combined. 2025 is shaping up to be potentially the most important year for Nvidia since I first highlighted Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis in my free stock newsletter in November 2018 and when the I/O Fund entered at $3.15 for returns of 3,280%. Including Q4’s estimate, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion to $130 billion in data center revenue in 2023 and 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone. Back in August, in the analysis Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings, I wrote: ‘According to reports from Wccftech: “Team Green is expected to ship 60,000 to 70,000 units of NVIDIA's GB200 AI servers, and given that one server is reported to cost around $2 million to $3 million per unit, this means that Team Green will bag in around a whopping $210 billion from just Blackwell servers along, that too in a year. The weight of that report cannot be overstated as it implies 26% upside to 2025’s estimates based on one SKU alone.” Despite Blackwell not yet shipping in full volume, there are multiple data points that support this ramp to $200+ billion in revenue. Perhaps the most important quote was one that could easily be overlooked — Nvidia’s management explained in Q3’s earnings that they have “completed a successful mask change for Blackwell…that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.” Since both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem beginning in Q4, there’s more emphasis on supply constraints moving forward, as management was clear in saying that both products have “certain supply constraints” with Blackwell’s demand “expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.” Broadly speaking, supply constraints are nothing new as it’s been widely understood Blackwell is already sold out for next year. By executing this mask change to improve production yields, Nvidia can theoretically get more usable chips per wafer, alleviating some supply fears and allowing it to meet higher demand levels, leading to higher revenue generation. Management already hinted at this, saying “we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated.” CEO Jensen Huang also explained that GPU clusters with Blackwell will be starting where Hopper left off: “You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells.” Even though Nvidia guided Q4 nearly in-line with analysts' expectations at $37.5 billion, there is still significant room for Blackwell to grow through 2025. Current forecasts point to revenue surpassing the $50 billion-mark one year from now, with revenue growth in excess of 40% for the next five quarters. A table displaying the wide range of analyst revenue estimates for Nvidia in FY26, highlighting a ... [+] $40 billion range for Q3 and a $70 billion range for Q4. The potential for Nvidia to achieve over $50 billion in quarterly data center revenue is also noted. Interestingly, there is still a massive disconnect in analyst estimates as FY26 progresses – estimates for Q3 have a nearly $40 billion range from the low to high estimates. When looking at Q4 of next year, there is a ridiculous $70 billion range, with some analysts predicting $31 billion at the low end while others have estimates as high as $101 billion. Should Nvidia maintain its quarterly cadence of beating by $2 billion from the midpoint of these estimates, and assuming data center mix remains at ~90%, Nvidia could easily exit FY26 with data center revenue at >$50 billion/quarter, or $200+ billion annualized compared to data center revenue of $140 billion this year. Big Tech’s capex supports this revenue growth story, as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet have all accelerated capex significantly in the past couple of quarters and reaffirmed the need to continue investing aggressively in AI infrastructure moving through 2025. Additionally, Big Tech is already spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s Blackwell lineup: This is but a fraction of 2025’s estimated capex– 2024’s capex could come in at ~$240 billion with an estimated $70 billion spent in Q4, with the four currently tracking for over $270 billion in capex predominantly for AI infrastructure in 2025. Nvidia has been capturing a lion’s share of AI spending from Big Tech, at ~80% to 85%, and assuming little change in its AI GPU market share with competition primarily arising from AMD and no one else, Big Tech’s spending implies a clear path towards $200 billion in GPU revenue in 2025. The importance of Big Tech’s capex was also echoed with the CEO stating we will see $1 trillion in data infrastructure rebuild before he expects to see digestion from the hyperscalers. Per Huang: “I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers.” That would imply another 3X from here for the remaining three-quarter trillion – not in stock price, but in capex. Presumably, it would mean a higher trajectory for the stock price in terms of valuing that revenue. Hopper drove another beat, which Nvidia is becoming widely known for. It’s rare for analysts to openly expect large beats going into a print, yet UBS had correctly tagged the beat this quarter at $2 billion. However, due to declining from peak revenue growth of 265% earlier this year, Hopper-driven growth of 94% is not what will drive the stock up for the next leg higher. Nvidia investors, such as myself, will need Blackwell’s pricing power and Blackwell’s clear demand signals to re-invigorate the stock. Nvidia reported 93.6% YoY growth, more than 10 points higher than consensus estimates for ~83% YoY growth. Nvidia is now lapping its peak growth quarters, Q4 FY24 and Q1 FY25, where revenue peaked at 265% growth due to Hopper ramping tremendously fast. Growth technically is decelerating nearly 30 points in Q3 and growth will further decelerate nearly 24 points next quarter, but to be reporting above 93% YoY and almost 70% YoY versus 200-260%+ growth comps is still a very strong report to say the least. A graph illustrating Nvidia’s year-over-year growth rates, showing a deceleration from peak growth ... [+] of 265% to current growth of 94%. The graph highlights Nvidia’s consistent beats against analyst estimates, driven by Hopper, and the anticipated future impact of Blackwell. For Q4, management guided for revenue of $37.5 billion, +/- 2%, just slightly ahead of consensus estimates for $37.02 billion at the midpoint. Analysts are now expecting $38.01 billion in revenue for Q4, just a week after the report, at the upper end of the guided range. Both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem moving forward as Blackwell ramps significantly through fiscal 2026. Analysts were nitpicking margins, yet this concern is overblown. Q3’s margins were relatively in line with guidance despite the $2 billion top-line beat, and for Q4, management forecast margins to contract nearly 2 points sequentially. However, CFO Colette Kress was clear that following Blackwell, gross margin will eventually return to its current percentage: “As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.” Investors should never underestimate Wall Street’s ability to miss the bigger picture. Analysts on the call cross-examined this 200 bp sequential decline despite Nvidia having an operating margin of over 60% compared to most of the Mag 7 having operating margins at half that. It’s also completely normal for semiconductors to feel margin pressures in the initial stages of ramping a new product, especially at this scale and pace. A chart showing Nvidia’s operating margins, highlighting the anticipated 2-point sequential decline ... [+] in Q4 and the projected return to mid-70s gross margins with the ramp-up of Blackwell. The chart emphasizes Nvidia’s strong current margins compared to industry peers. The bigger picture for Nvidia moving forward is that Blackwell holds the potential to dwarf Hopper’s revenue generation in fewer quarters. Breaking it down further on CNBC, I stated Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power I had been quite vocal prior to earnings that Q3’s report was nothing but a blip in the longer-term picture, with 2025 being much more important than this quarterly report.

They have retail gas outlets in many U.S. states and drilling and refinery outposts all over the globe. Despite the potential threat posed by carbon emissions, much of the world's automotive, aviation, and shipping industries are powered by Chevron products. With the decidedly pro-fossil fuel Trump Administration set to take office in January, many energy sector analysts are betting that stocks like Chevron will continue to perform well. Chevron is coming off a strong Q3 2024, highlighted by $51 billion in revenue and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.51, which beat the consensus expectation of $2.47. This $161.50 stock is paying a 4% dividend, or about $1.60 per share. Conditions are ripe for an even bigger 2025.

You may consider diversifying with dividend stocks from other energy sectors. Entergy is a Louisiana-based energy company that provides power for over three million residents in Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana. It's also one of the largest nuclear energy providers in the country. Aside from Entergy's sizable customer base, which provides it with ongoing revenue, Entergy's nuclear power capabilities give it tremendous potential as a fuel source for AI. This has been a big factor in pushing Entergy's share price up almost 50% in the last 12 months, and many believe there is still room for growth. Benzinga's analyst profile of Entergy stock shows that most of its 17 analysts give it a "buy" rating. BMO Capital, Mizuho, and Barclays set new price targets for Entergy on Nov. 18, with the average of the three targets coming in at $158.67. That's about a 5% potential upside compared to the current share price of $151.06. Entergy also pays a 3.17% dividend, or $4.79 per share. Keep an eye on this stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks paused near record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for a reading on the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge to provide clues to the path of interest rates. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were little changed, coming off fresh all-time highs for the indexes. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) fell 0.3%. The mood is muted in the wind-down to the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see markets shut on Thursday and close early on Friday. But the Fed is taking the fore again after being eclipsed somewhat by debate over the impact of Donald Trump's tariff plans and cabinet choices. The October print of its preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, is due for release on Wednesday morning. Focus is on whether inflation has stalled, as some officials believe, and minutes from the Fed's last meeting suggested a cautious stance on interest-rate cuts. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. A print matching those expectations will likely weigh on bets for a rate cut in December. Traders currently see a roughly 34% chance the Fed holds rates steady at that meeting, up from a roughly 24% a month before, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Updates on third-quarter GDP, durable goods data, and initial jobless claims are also on the economic docket. Questions about whether Trump's agenda will heat up price pressures are also in play for the Fed, some analysts believe, though policymakers aren't able to speak openly on the debate. Trump on Tuesday tapped Jamieson Greer — a veteran of his first term — as US trade representative. Given Greer was heavily involved in Trump's original China tariffs, Wall Street is assessing what his role could mean for the big new tariffs promised for the US's top trading partners. On the corporate front, Dell (DELL) shares sank over 10% after quarterly revenue fell short amid flagging PC demand. Peer HP's (HPQ) stock also fell post-earnings, down 8%. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Shares of automakers General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) were throttled on Tuesday following Trump's tariffs threats toward Mexico, China and Canada. GM lost 9%, while Ford dropped 3% as both companies have a strong presence in Mexico. But automakers aren't the only companies that stand to be hurt by tariffs, of course. Think computers and t-shirts! Here's what HP Inc. (HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) CEO Fran Horowitz told me on the tariff topic. Enrique Lores "Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be." Fran Horowitz "When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly," Horowitz said. "It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge. In 2024 we will not be receiving more than 5% or 6% of our US receipts from China. We're taking a look at it country by country, but the agility that we've built into our supply chain is really what's going to help us manage through this." Griffin's Citadel hedge fund made some big moves in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena during the September-ended quarter. Pharmaceutical stocks make great additions to any portfolio in any market environment. A good one promises steady revenue growth thanks to the fact that patients need their medicines -- so will continue with them no matter what the economy is doing. A top pharma stock also may have one particular star product that brings in blockbuster revenue, and this growth could drive stock performance. Despite being a net seller of stocks to the tune of $166 billion over the last eight quarters, there are two premier stocks the Oracle of Omaha can't stop buying. Every investor wants to see his portfolio generate a solid return, and there’s no shortage of strategies to achieve this goal. One of the more popular strategies is dividend investing – a timeless approach that continues to stand the test of time. The key here is the long-term total outperformance of the total return. Hartford Funds, after reviewing 50 years’ worth of stock records, demonstrated that dividend stocks generated an average annual return exceeding 9% for the half-century ending in 2 Nvidia and other chip giants in the artificial intelligence space have powered this ETF to incredible long-term returns. A historic Los Angeles home once owned by actor Gene Wilder and later by Elon Musk is heading to foreclosure auction. According to Mansion Global, the property, originally listed for $12.95 million in August, has been significantly reduced to $9.5 ... If you're an investor looking for high-yield investments with some solid upside potential, there is perhaps no better place to look than the energy midstream space. The sector has gone through a transformation in the past decade, with midstream companies reducing leverage and being more disciplined when it comes to funding growth projects. Against that backdrop, let's look a three great MLPs -- Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET), and Western Midstream (NYSE: WES) -- investors might want to consider buying and holding forever. There is so much to love about Shopify. Shopify went through a difficult period recently as it tried to build on some of its highest-ever growth and needed to reacclimate to slowing demand, but it's landed on its feet. Nobody can predict the future, but it's not hard to imagine increasing pharmaceutical sales. In 2022, prescription drug spending in the U.S. climbed more than 8% to reach $406 billion. It might not feel like it when you pay the bill, but prescription drugs give healthcare systems a tremendous return on their investment. Warren Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 2022 that anyone advising their kids on how to "make money per point of IQ and per erg of energy, tell them to go to Wall Street." The legendary investor also said he'd bet on monkeys making stock picks before he'd bet on Wall Street. Before we get to what Wall Street thinks was Buffett's smartest move in Q3, I have to point out that analysts disagreed with most of Buffett's recent trades. Sign in to access your portfolio

Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information are in the prospectus. Please read the prospectuses carefully before you invest. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

(NYSE:NRG) stands against other AI news updates that Wall Street is monitoring. AI companies in the United States, many of whom have extensive business relations in China, are waiting anxiously for President-elect Donald Trump to assume office and announce possible changes to American policies towards China that will provide greater clarity on future US trade with the Asian country. Top executives from US-based firms were in China recently to meet with Chinese business leaders amid rumors of a massive spike in tariffs on goods being imported to Washington from Beijing. Latest reports from news platform Axios contend that Donald Trump is considering the appointment of an AI czar in the White House to coordinate federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Per the report, billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly backed Trump during the 2024 election and is rumored to have a key influence over the President-elect on AI policy, will not be the AI czar. However, the report adds that Musk is nevertheless expected to be involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases related to AI. xAI, the AI startup Musk founded in 2023, recently raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. xAI is competing with OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker with a valuation of more than $157 billion.

The advisory is increasing its 2029 EBITDA estimate to $4.5 billion, up about $230 million from its prior estimate and almost $1 billion higher than the sleepy consensus, to more fully reflect the company’s $750 million growth plan. Overall, NRG ranks 11th on our list of AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. While we acknowledge the potential of NRG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: The new ‘land grab’ for AI companies, from Meta to OpenAI, is military contracts
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/27/ai-companies-meta-llama-openai-google-us-defense-military-contracts/
Time Published: 2024-11-27T11:05:00Z

Silicon Valley AI companies have a new BFF: the U.S. Department of Defense. The leading companies developing generative AI technology have spun up, deepened, or started to pursue relationships with the military in recent months in some cases even revising or making exceptions to internal policies to remove roadblocks and restrictions on defense work. Several agencies within the DoD, from The Air Force to various Intelligence groups, are actively testing out use cases for AI models and tools from Meta, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral, along with tech from startups like Gladstone AI and ScaleAI, several people with knowledge of the testing told Fortune. It’s a remarkable turn of events for the internet companies, who until very recently treated defense work as if it were taboo, if not outright verboten. But with the cost to develop and run generative AI services already totaling hundreds of billions of dollars, and showing no signs of slowing, AI companies are feeling the pressure to show some returns on the massive investments. The DoD, with its essentially unlimited budget and long standing interest in cutting-edge technology, suddenly doesn’t look so bad. Although landing a contract with Defense can be tricky, with layers of certifications to receive and strict compliance standards to follow, “the rewards are significant” and the money can come in for years, Erica Brescia, a managing partner at Redpoint Ventures who focuses on AI investing, said. “DoD contracts provide substantial annual contract values, or ACVs, and create long-term opportunities for growth and market defensibility,” Brescia said. Brescia added that going after Defense work has recently become more socially acceptable in tech circles. Not only are company leaders looking at the hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts that defense-focused startups like Palantir and Anduril are raking in, but the “changing political landscape” has made “pursuing defense as a primary market segment an increasingly attractive option for companies prepared to navigate longer sales cycles and handle complex deployments.” An embrace of military work may indeed suit the political moment well, with a business-friendly Trump administration set to take office in January, and a cohort of hawkish Silicon Valley insiders, led by “First Buddy” Elon Musk, in the president elect’s inner circle. Musk’s mandate in his official role as co-head of the new Department of Government Efficiency is to sharply curtail spending. But few expect the Pentagon’s budget to see serious cutbacks, particularly when it comes to AI at a time when the U.S. and China are locked in battle for AI supremacy. For now, much of the military’s work with generative AI appears to be small-scale projects and tests, but the potential for generative AI tech to become a fundamental aspect of computing in the future means the relationship between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon could be huge. Defense uses of AI do not necessarily entail drone warfare or blowing things up. A lot of AI-specific work within the DoD is the more mundane activity that any office would gladly hand off to a capable technology. Data labeling, collection and sorting are common uses of AI within the department, as is the use of ChatGPT and Claude chatbots that most people can access online, but which require extra security when used by the DoD. Large language models could also prove handy for analyzing and searching classified information, aiding in government cybersecurity work, and providing better computer vision and autonomy for things like robotic tools, drones and tanks. Some tech companies do attempt to specifically avoid being involved in DoD projects that could be utilized in “the kill chain,” a military term referring to the structure of an attack on an enemy, a former official within the DoD told Fortune regarding companies that win procurement contracts. Such concerns sometimes dissipate however, as millions, or billions, of dollars become available. “Once you get in, you want to expand,” the person added. Some tech companies, like Palantir and Anduril, have for years made Defense uses and contracts the backbone of their entire business. Within Silicon Valley’s established internet companies and some of its younger AI startups, however, military work was eschewed as the firms sought to recruit and retain left-leaning engineering talent. When Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, it reportedly committed never to use the startup’s technology for military purposes. And in 2018 Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai faced an internal backlash over Google’s participation in Project Maven, a Pentagon drone warfare effort. While Google insisted its technology was used for only “non offensive purposes” such as analyzing drone video footage, the employee outcry was loud enough that Pichai cancelled a vacation to reassure staff and eventually promised Google would not develop its AI for weapons. Google’s “AI principles” now stipulate that it will “not pursue… weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people,” nor for “surveillance violating internationally accepted norms.” But the policy leaves plenty of wiggle room and the company has explicitly said it will not swear off working with the military entirely. The story is similar at other big AI players. Meta initially prohibited its Llama model from being used in military work, as did OpenAI, while Anthropic initially built its Claude model to be “harmless.” Now, all three have announced that such work with their models is fine, and they’re actively pursuing such uses. Sam Altman, who co-founded OpenAI on the principle of developing AI to “benefit humanity as a whole,” and who once said there were things he would “never do with the Department of Defense,” has since removed any commitment to such restrictions from its usage policy. One venture capitalist focused on investing in AI companies pointed to VC firm Andreessen Horowitz’s “American Dynamism” essay two years ago as a moment when avoidance of defense contracting started to shift. The essay explicitly said tech companies working on defense were working in support of America’s national interest. “Executives started to think, ‘Oh, ok, defending America, working with the military, is good actually,” the VC said. The widespread post-pandemic layoffs at tech companies has also had a chilling effect on employee protests, giving tech employers more freedom to pursue military business. The DoD has already paid out close to $1 billion in official contracts to AI companies in the last two years, according to a Fortune analysis. While details of such contracts are vague, they have been awarded to companies like Morsecorp, which is focused on autonomous vehicle technology, and a subsidiary of ASGN, a management and consulting company, to develop new AI prototypes. Not all such contracts are made public. But any government procurement contract awarded to a major AI company would likely be worth tens of millions to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in revenue for those companies — and for their largest backers. OpenAI’s largest investor is Microsoft, which recently said its Azure cloud service had been approved for DoD agencies to use OpenAI’s AI models for information at lower levels of security clearance – something that took years of investment in specialized infrastructure to achieve. Similarly, Anthropic’s largest backer is Amazon. Amazon Web Services is perhaps the single largest cloud provider to the DoD and has tens of billions of dollars worth of government contracts. For both companies, being able to add new AI services and tools to DoD offerings could prove valuable. Same goes for a company like Google, which also has secured valuable government contracts, and its Gemini AI model. “They’re basically building the airplane while they’re flying it, so it’s a massive land grab,” one AI executive told Fortune, referring to more tech companies suddenly eager to have their AI tools and models in the hands of the DoD. The DoD defines AI among its 14 “critical technology areas,” as it holds “tremendous promise” and is “imperative to dominate future conflicts.” About a year ago, the DoD officially created the Office of Strategic Capital, a new federal credit program in partnership with the Small Business Administration, in order to ensure that critical technologies like AI receive funding through direct loans. For fiscal 2024, OSC made $984 million available that it intended to hand out to 10 companies focused on things like autonomous robotics and microelectronics fabrication, which typically includes AI chip fabrication. The DoD is investing another roughly $700 million in chip fabrication and the build out of domestic semiconductor manufacturing, which is critical to the creation of AI chips. Despite billions in investment and no signs of that slowing down within Defense, the AI executive admitted that most AI products today are simply “not that useful yet,” either for Defense or the public at large. But having them applied at scale in a government or defense environment could make them more useful, more quickly. “The military effectively created the Internet, too.” ARPANET, a key technological foundation of the modern Internet, was built within the DoD, as were now common technologies like radar and GPS systems. Although a department like Defense wants useful products, it also famously sees its budget increase year after year, hitting just below $1 trillion in 2024. About half of that budget is awarded to companies that contract with the department. “Honestly, yeah, they really love to blow money,” the executive said.

Title: CrowdStrike delivers better-than-expected Q3 print, lifts annual forecast
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/crowdstrike-beats-q3-estimates-on-cybersecurity-demand-3743129
Time Published: 2024-11-27T10:44:48Z

Investing.com -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) on Tuesday reported a better than expected quarterly earnings and raised annual outlook on the back of strong demand for its cybersecurity products at a time when there are rising online threats fueled by the use of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the company's shares fell 6% in premarket trading Wednesday after its fourth-quarter revenue guidance failed to impress investors. For the third quarter, CrowdStirke's revenue rose about 29% to $1.01 billion, beating estimates of $982 million. It reported a profit per share of 93 cents, above expectations of 81 cents. “CrowdStrike surpassed $4 billion in ending ARR in the quarter - the fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone - as our single platform approach and trailblazing innovation continue to resonate at-scale,” said CEO George Kurtz. For Q4, the company expects Q4 revenue to be between $1.03 billion and $1.04 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $1.03 billion. It now forecasts its annual adjusted profit per share to be between $3.74 and $3.76, up from its previous range of $3.61 to $3.65. "While the outage impact is still in play, Flex and financial services (CFS) are driving greater module adoption, larger deal sizes, and longer duration contracts," Oppenheimer analysts said in a post-earnings note. "This, combined with customers opting for more modules vs. extended deal terms as part of the Customer Commitment Package (CPP), suggests strong customer commitment and a likely recovery in 2HFY26." "We expect the stock to remain range-bound until investors gain greater clarity around ARR comments, which changed from ARR to NNARR re-acceleration in 2HFY26." RBC Capital Markets voiced similar comments, noting that CRWD management has executed well following the July outage. The incident led to near-term challenges but "should not impact customer lifetime value (LTV)," analysts noted. "The outage weighed on guidance, which we view as prudently conservative, but commentary around a 2H/26 net-new ARR re-acceleration shows confidence in the short duration of expected headwinds," they added.

Title: As Patagonia tightens operations, workers say the company has lost its soul

Time Published: 2024-11-27T10:02:52Z

The sustainable brand is cutting jobs and expediting service to survive. Employees say the company has lost its soul. When new employees join Patagonia, they're handed a copy of "Let My People Go Surfing." The company's founder, Yvon Chouinard, who wrote the book in 2005, said it was intended as a "philosophical manual for the employees of Patagonia." In the book, Chouinard declares that treating employees well is a key corporate responsibility. "One thing I never wanted to change, even if we got serious: Work had to be enjoyable on a daily basis," Chouinard wrote. "We needed to blur that distinction between work and play and family." Since its founding in 1973, Patagonia has positioned itself as a workplace nirvana — a community more so than a company, one that prioritizes the well-being of the Earth and of its employees above all else. But in the past few years, as sales have slowed, the outdoor-apparel brand has buckled down, cutting redundant jobs, tracking performance metrics, and banning long-standing practices such as letting sales representatives sell Patagonia samples to friends and family on the side. It has also started to respond to customers' demand for delivery at Amazon speed. The rejiggering is a means of survival, a necessity, Patagonia says, to provide for its 3,000-plus employees. But the retailer is now dealing with the fallout from disappointed staffers who say the new rigidity feels antithetical to the company's ethos. "It's always been a self-critical culture," Vincent Stanley, Patagonia's director of philosophy, told Business Insider. "Whenever the company does something that's not well understood to be part of the values, you get a lot of internal reaction to it." Patagonia is a billion-dollar company with more than 70 stores worldwide. The brand's $130 vests and $280 jackets are just as likely to be sported on Wall Street as in the great outdoors — earning it the nickname "Patagucci." Patagonia's commitment to do good is integral to the brand. In 1985 it created an "Earth tax," pledging 1% of sales to preserve and restore the natural environment. Over the years it has donated the equivalent of $226 million to environmental causes. Patagonia's sales soared during the pandemic. From summer 2020 to summer 2022, sales grew at a rate of about 20% to 25% companywide, Alan Adams, a former US regional sales rep for Montana, Wyoming, and Alaska, told BI. Adams, who left Patagonia in 2023, said COVID-19 restrictions led to an "unsustainable" boom, adding that the renewed interest in outdoor activities had people stocking up on all-weather gear and apparel. For a period, as California ports faced major backlogs, Patagonia relied on planes to transport about a third of its goods. (Before the pandemic, about 80% of Patagonia stock was shipped by barge, a decidedly more environmentally friendly option.) A Patagonia spokesperson told BI that it uses less air freight now than it did before the pandemic. Patagonia started to attract a new customer base less attached to its green credentials and more demanding of superspeed delivery. "What we do to make the customer happy and to save ourselves from backlash is not environmentally sustainable," said a current customer-service, or CX, manager who has been at the company for multiple years. "If someone doesn't like their repair, it doesn't match perfectly, then we ship them a new item overnight." The Patagonia spokesperson said it had been tricky to navigate the demand for instant gratification. "What I don't know is how do we support our customer-service team when customers are like, 'Well, Amazon sends it to me overnight. Why can't Patagonia?'" the spokesperson said. She added that Patagonia has an "ironclad guarantee" to give customers a new item if they don't like a repair. While overnight shipping is an option, Patagonia tries to direct customers away from that choice with pricing and messaging, she said. Workers said Chouinard, now 86, was typically one to challenge decisions that prioritized profit over sustainability. Adams said that at an event in Idaho around 2013, Chouinard seemed shocked at how large Patagonia's sales representatives' trucks were. He kicked a tire and asked one rep: "Why do you have this huge truck? That's not what we're about." In September 2022, Chouinard, who sits on Patagonia's board, announced that he was giving away his shares of the company to a newly formed trust to fight the climate crisis. At about this time, Patagonia began reassessing its operations. For the better part of the year, the spokesperson said, the senior leadership team was "locked in a room" figuring out which priorities they weren't achieving and how decision-making could be improved. They also hired consultants to help restructure the company, the spokesperson added. Many employees felt as though Patagonia's new direction directly threatened the utopia they — and customers — had been sold. A worker from the digital team expressed concern about Patagonia's buy-now, pay-later feature that launched this past June. "It feels like it's encouraging people to spend more money than they can currently afford, and buy more things that they don't need, which goes directly against Patagonia's mission and anti-consumption message," the employee said. Stanley, the company's director of philosophy, told BI that growth had brought about "complicated decisions" like how to balance the long-term business health against the company's core values while providing a consistent level of benefits to all employees. Financial stability, he said, was crucial for Patagonia to honor its commitments. Like many companies in the wake of the pandemic, Patagonia was left with a surplus of staff and inventory, Adams said. In the past few years, it has tried to rein in costs and streamline business operations. In the fall of 2022, Patagonia said it would stop allowing sales reps to sell extra clothing samples to their friends and family. Adams, who made about $350,000 in 2022, according to tax documents seen by BI, said this was a significant change. He said that even with a promised increase to his base salary and bonus, he would have expected to bring in just under $200,000 in 2023 with the new rules. (The spokesperson said the salary increases and bonuses were meant to fully make up any differences in sales reps' total pay.) The following year, Patagonia adjusted a three-year-old policy of closing for the last week of December. The Patagonia spokesperson told BI that the new policy asked CX and warehouse employees to volunteer for holiday shifts at higher pay in order to ensure customers received service during the busy season. In July 2023, Patagonia introduced a career-leveling plan for all US employees to more clearly define roles and match pay grades to the market standard. The company also became more focused on tracking metrics across teams. "It used to be that we would be able to stay on the phone with a customer for an hour and a half and just connect with them and talk to them," the CX employee who has been at Patagonia for multiple years told BI. "And now we get dinged for having long phone calls." The Patagonia spokesperson told BI that, "We look at time on calls because it is a metric to make sure everyone is trained appropriately, but no one is dinged for this." Eventually, though, the company began cutting jobs. In June, Patagonia gave 90 employees on the CX team 72 hours to decide whether they wanted to relocate to one of seven US hubs or leave their jobs. Only four chose to relocate, according to an internal memo seen by BI. The Patagonia spokesperson told BI that the changes were "crucial for us to build a vibrant team culture" and that the CX team had been overstaffed by 200% to 300%. Three months later, Patagonia announced that 41 corporate staffers had been let go. In an internal memo sent the day the layoffs were announced, Stanley wrote that the company was experiencing the first sales decline in its history. In a follow-up FAQ about the layoffs, Stanley added that because of the financial strains, travel would be limited, bonuses would be lowered, and hiring would be paused across the company. After being told for years how important employees' happiness was and even being handed a book expounding these merits, workers were shaken. In "Let My People Go Surfing," Chouinard called layoffs "almost unthinkable" for Patagonia and described a round of job cuts in 1991 as "the single darkest day in the company's history." Several people said the 72-hour deadline for CX employees was insufficient to make such a major life decision. Another CX worker still at the company said the ultimatum was presented without "dignity or care or anything that Patagonia stands for." During a time when workers more generally were growing distrustful of their workplaces, many felt Patagonia was trying to "quiet fire" staffers, with one employee calling it "an easy way for them to reduce their head count rather than waiting for attrition." Nick Helmreich, a team lead at Patagonia's outlet store in Reno, Nevada, since 2022, recalled one colleague telling him, "Camelot is truly dead." Many employees BI talked to said that, despite the recent upheavals, the company still treated its employees better than most corporations. But they said the brand was not living up to the standards with which it markets itself. In March, nine of the 15 eligible employees working at Patagonia's Reno store voted to form the company's first union. "Pay is really only one of the reasons for organizing," Helmreich said. "Employees aren't going to be excited about protecting the planet if you cannot protect the people doing that work." The CX worker who's been at the company for years told BI that "the focus appears to be shifting away from the principles of mutual respect and community that Patagonia has long championed." Patagonia said it takes employees' concerns seriously. But as Stanley wrote in his internal note in September, the workforce may not always agree with leadership's decisions: "The balancing act is delicate but is not essentially one of compromising between opposing interests (though some horse trading is involved). We are at our best when we can take a single action that benefits each of our stakeholders, or as many as possible." Corrections: November 28, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misstated when Patagonia created the "Earth tax." It was 1985, not 2001. An earlier version also wasn't clear about the number of employees who voted for the company's first union at the Reno, Nevada, store. It was nine of 15 able to vote; the store has had about 25 workers. Additionally, we have clarified the company's policy surrounding time off during the last week of December and have added a statement from Patagonia regarding performance metrics. Jump to

Title: While private equity firms own 40% of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 49% ownership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significant control over SATS by individual investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions 50% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders 11% of SATS is held by Institutions A look at the shareholders of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Meanwhile, private equity firms make up 40% of the company’s shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of SATS, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for SATS Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that SATS does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of SATS, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in SATS. Our data shows that Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited is the largest shareholder with 40% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 2.2%. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that SATS Ltd. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around S$19m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 49% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private equity firms hold a 40% stake in SATS. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand SATS better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for SATS that you should be aware of. Ultimately the future is most important.

And analysts warn that President-elect Donald Trump is likely to inherit this headache too. The metal is not gold, silver, or uranium. It’s not the lithium used for EV batteries. It’s not the copper that is essential for electrification. It’s not even the rare earth elements that are crucial for everything from smartphones to wind turbines. This metal has a global annual production of less than 100,000 tons – a small fraction of the lead, copper, and iron produced every year. But it is a vital component in everything from armor-piercing bullets, nuclear weapons, explosive missiles to fire retardants in electronics and military uniforms. Most importantly, there are no viable alternatives at the moment. But one forward-looking company, Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF), has recently purchased historically-proven deposits that could swiftly address America's most pressing resource vulnerability in recent times. The metal we’re talking about is antimony, and its scarcity has Western governments rattled.Military Metals CEO Scott Eldridge sees a major antimony supply crunch coming. And antimony prices this year, along with new Chinese restrictions add extra support to that prediction with prices tripling since earlier this year from $12,000 per ton to $38,000. That’s why the company acquired past-producing antimony mines on two continents at breakneck speed. But first, let’s zoom in on antimony demand, and prices, and why they are going through the roof right now. The Global Antimony Supply Squeeze The current crisis stems from China’s dominance in both global antimony production and refining. China, Russia, and Tajikistan control 85% of the world’s antimony supply. Antimony is not easy to extract and it’s often a by-product in the extraction of other metals like gold, silver, or copper. And China, which also currently controls 65% of global antimony refining capacity, has just imposed troubling new restrictions on its export. Because China controls most of the world’s antimony, when they cut supply Western military supply chains are directly impacted. According to a recent article published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., the U.S. only has 20 days’ worth of antimony inventory. Germany has just 2 days’ worth of munitions supply. And geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, and other places continue to aggravate the demand for antimony. So, antimony demand from defense is at record highs right now, and it’s only going to increase exponentially in the years to come. Washington's $1.8 Billion Antimony Push All these factors have together pushed antimony prices past $38,000 per ton – a 300% price increase in just the last 24 months. And this might just be the start! Understandably, political support for securing critical mineral supply chains across the globe is intensifying. Major economies like the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Japan, Australia, the European Union, and South Korea have all classified antimony as a “critical mineral.” And the U.S. government is keen on backing domestic antimony projects to reduce dependence on Chinese imports. As a part of that initiative, Perpetua Resources Corp., a mining company focused on developing gold-antimony deposits in the Stibnite district of Idaho, is securing a $1.8B loan from U.S. Export-Import Bank, along with an additional $60M from the Department of Defense. As a result, Perpetua’s stock has shot up over 400% since March this year. But this rapid surge is just one example of the antimony sector's explosive potential. Now, Military Metals Corp (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF), an under-the-radar company with premium assets in friendly NATO territory is positioning itself for even bigger success...The company recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia. The flagship Trojarova property here features a historical Soviet-era resource of 61,998.4 tonnes of antimony which has a in-situ value of over $2 billion of antimony in the ground at today’s spot prices. Located just 30 minutes from Bratislava with excellent infrastructure, the company thinks they can fast-track this project with a resource estimate within 6 months. Then there’s the Tienesgrund property, also in Slovakia, which covers 13.38 km² and encompasses 40-50 historical mining tunnels dating back to 1840. Historical Soviet-era work estimated 162t with an average grade of 7.7% antimony here, and the company expects to establish a resource within 12 months. Their West Gore property in Nova Scotia, which was one of Canada's largest antimony producers during World War I still holds significant unmined material. Historical ore extracts showed as high as 46% antimony content. Lastly, their Bear Creek property in Slovakia is a historical high-grade tin resource. The company got this project as a part of their Slovakia deal, but they’re thinking of divesting this to get money for their antimony projects. Key Factors Driving Military Metals Corp.’s Story At this critical point in the antimony market, Military Metals Corp. stands out for five key reasons... To sum up, as global demand for antimony continues to rise and geopolitical tensions persist, securing stable supplies outside of China’s control remains a key challenge for Western nations. 8 bonus stocks to keep an eye on: Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. As U.S. President Biden nears the end of his term, there’s one little-known metal whose scarcity is keeping him up at night even today. And analysts warn that President-elect Donald Trump is likely to inherit this headache too. The metal is not gold, silver, or uranium. It’s not the lithium used for EV batteries.

As a result, Perpetua’s stock has shot up over 400% since March this year. But this rapid surge is just one example of the antimony sector's explosive potential. Now, Military Metals Corp (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF), an under-the-radar company with premium assets in friendly NATO territory is positioning itself for even bigger success... The company recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia. The flagship Trojarova property here features a historical Soviet-era resource of 61,998.4 tonnes of antimony which has a in-situ value of over $2 billion of antimony in the ground at today’s spot prices. Located just 30 minutes from Bratislava with excellent infrastructure, the company thinks they can fast-track this project with a resource estimate within 6 months. Then there’s the Tienesgrund property, also in Slovakia, which covers 13.38 km² and encompasses 40-50 historical mining tunnels dating back to 1840. Historical Soviet-era work estimated 162t with an average grade of 7.7% antimony here, and the company expects to establish a resource within 12 months. Their West Gore property in Nova Scotia, which was one of Canada's largest antimony producers during World War I still holds significant unmined material. Historical ore extracts showed as high as 46% antimony content. Lastly, their Bear Creek property in Slovakia is a historical high-grade tin resource. The company got this project as a part of their Slovakia deal, but they’re thinking of divesting this to get money for their antimony projects. Key Factors Driving Military Metals Corp.’s Story At this critical point in the antimony market, Military Metals Corp. stands out for five key reasons... Significant Growth Potential: Even though the Military Metals Corp. stock has seen a substantial run in recent times, with the current market cap of just $23M vs real asset potential, there’s a lot more upside yet to be unlocked. Rising Market Awareness: Growing media coverage in the Financial Times, Forbes, etc., gives early investors a massive advantage in capitalizing on the coming antimony surge. Pure Antimony Play: Unlike gold or oil, there are no ETFs or futures contracts to trade antimony. Equity investments into junior mining companies, like Military Metals Corp., is the only real way to get exposure to antimony. Premium Asset Portfolio: The company has assets located at three prime locations in Slovakia and one location in Canada. Plus, the project qualifies under the European Critical Raw Materials Act, potentially helping to accelerate its development. To sum up, as global demand for antimony continues to rise and geopolitical tensions persist, securing stable supplies outside of China’s control remains a key challenge for Western nations. 8 bonus stocks to keep an eye on: Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

Title: Trump’s tariffs promise chaos — and Australia’s investments are in the firing line

End-of-year sale now on Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Australia's Future Fund has more than 40% of its assets invested in the US economy, which means the damage Trump inflicts hurts us too. Glenn Dyer and Bernard Keane Nov 27, 2024 21 Too bad if you’re a US company, like an automobile manufacturer, reliant on imports from Mexico. Donald Trump just promised to impose a 25% tax on your supply chain, along with everything else imported from Mexico. And Canada. The fact Trump himself negotiated and signed a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020, is apparently irrelevant. And he’s announced a 10% “just for starters” tariff on Chinese imports. In response — even though Trump won’t be inaugurated for another two months — sharemarkets fell, but the US dollar rose (sending the Australian dollar falling further). The greenback had already risen against major currencies after Trump’s victory on November 5, and will likely appreciate every time the president-elect announces new tariffs — until markets price in the full effect of the tariff wall Trump has promised to erect around America. Each appreciation of the dollar will further erode the competitiveness of US exports and improve the competitiveness of imports against American products — undermining the very point of Trump’s taxes. Given how little grasp he appears to have about who bears the costs of tariffs, Trump will possibly react by simply increasing tariffs further. Along with his promise to deport every undocumented worker in the country, inflicting serious labour shortages on industries like construction and agriculture that depend on illegal immigrants for much of their workforce, and his threats to curtail the independence of the Federal Reserve, the tariffs will make for extremely uncertain times for US business — and investors in the US. Prominent among such investors is Australia’s Future Fund. Page 61 of the Fund’s 2023-24 annual report reveals that 43% of its $229.7 billion in assets are located in America via a heavy US weighting of listed and private equity, property, infrastructure and credit. That compares to just 27% of its assets invested in Australia, and is up from 39% in 2022-23. That’s a substantial change from before the pandemic: in 2019-20, Australia held the biggest share of the Future Fund’s assets — 39% against 31% for the US. The shift has also been lucrative for the Fund, which has benefitted from a stronger performance of Wall Street. US stocks have had a huge run since the start of 2023 with a 54% gain for the S&P 500, much of that coming from stocks like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Alphabet and Amazon. That index is up 26% this year to date against a 9.8% rise for the Australian ASX 200. But what about from here? It is hard to see how Trump’s tariffs, deportations and intervention in monetary policy will do anything else than damage US investor and consumer confidence, help slow the fall in inflationary pressures both in America and globally, reduce US exports and eventually undermine stock markets. Trump’s first presidency doesn’t appear to be a reliable guide: Wall Street rose by more than 40% during his first stint in the White House, but much of that was due to a huge pandemic surge from March 2020 that had little to do with Trump. What measures and hedging is the Fund putting in place to curb the risk posed by the next Trump presidency? An update on how it views the risks of its heavy investment in the US economy would be worthwhile — especially given the government is pressuring the fund to invest more in its favoured sectors here in Australia. It would be good to know if any shifts in weightings are because of risk management, rather than being responsive to Jim Chalmers’ interference. Have something to say about this article?

Title: 4 gold investments to consider for 2025 (and 4 to avoid)

By Angelica Leicht Edited By Matt Richardson November 26, 2024 / 3:22 PM EST / CBS News Gold has always held a unique position as a hedge against economic uncertainty, inflation and currency fluctuations — but the bull run that occurred over the past year may have been an even bigger selling point for investors. Starting the year at about $2,063 per ounce, gold's price moved upward quickly, hitting numerous new price records before peaking at over $2,736 per ounce in late October. That uptick in price helped to attract lots of new investors to the precious metals market. While the price of gold has dipped a bit since that point, many analysts still expect gold to hit the unprecedented milestone of $3,000 per ounce soon. So, if you've been planning to join the new and seasoned investors who have added gold to their portfolios recently, you may want to make your move quickly. Gold's price tends to fluctuate over the shorter term, so if you wait, you could miss out on the opportunity to buy gold at a lower price point. Before you start investing in this precious metal, though, it's important to recognize that not all gold investments are created equal. As we look ahead to 2025, certain gold assets stand out as potentially promising opportunities, while others carry risks that may outweigh their potential rewards. Ready to add gold to your portfolio? Get started here. Investing in these gold assets could pay off next year: Investing in physical gold in the form of gold bars and coins remains one of the safest ways to capitalize on potential price increases. These tangible assets provide direct ownership of gold and are highly liquid and universally recognized, making them an excellent choice for those seeking a straightforward hedge against economic instability. And, given all of the economic unknowns as we close in on 2025, making this type of gold investment could be a smart move to help protect your portfolio. Find out more about your gold investing options today. Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a convenient and cost-effective way to gain exposure to gold without the need for storage or insurance. These funds closely track the price of gold and are easily traded on stock exchanges, making them accessible to most types of investors. And with the expectation that gold prices will continue to rise over time, gold ETFs provide a flexible option for investors looking to benefit from upward momentum without committing to physical assets. Gold mining companies often experience amplified returns when gold prices rise, making these stocks an attractive option for growth-oriented investors. Stocks in major gold producers could see significant gains if gold's price climbs in 2025, so it makes sense to consider this type of gold investment in the new year. Investing in mining stocks also allows you to benefit from operational efficiencies and discoveries that can further boost profitability. Royalty and streaming companies could be another smart option for 2025. These companies provide financing to mining operations in exchange for a percentage of future production or revenue. This model insulates them from the operational risks associated with mining while still allowing them to profit from rising gold prices and their diversified portfolios and lower exposure to production costs make them a stable investment for those seeking exposure to the gold market. It could also make sense to avoid these gold investments right now: While standard gold ETFs are a solid investment, leveraged ETFs are a different story. These funds use borrowed money to amplify returns, which also increases potential losses. Leveraged ETFs are designed for short-term trading, not long-term holding, and can be highly volatile. With gold's trajectory uncertain despite optimistic predictions, these instruments are too risky for most investors right now. Junior mining companies, known for exploring and developing new gold deposits, can offer massive upside potential but are also incredibly risky. Many of these companies operate without generating consistent revenue, relying on capital markets for funding. If gold prices fail to rally as expected, these speculative investments could result in significant losses. Gold futures contracts allow investors to speculate on the future price of gold, but they require a high degree of expertise and risk tolerance. Small price movements can lead to substantial gains or losses, so unless you're an experienced trader, futures contracts are best avoided, especially in a potentially volatile gold market. While gold jewelry has intrinsic and aesthetic value, it is typically not a practical investment vehicle. High markups, craftsmanship costs and limited resale value make jewelry an inefficient way to capitalize on rising gold prices. Purer forms of gold like coins, bars or ETFs tend to offer better returns. Given the current economic landscape, 2025 could be a pivotal year for gold investors. Focusing on reliable investments like physical gold, gold ETFs and established mining companies can help you capitalize on it. At the same time, avoiding risky ventures such as speculative stocks, leveraged instruments and risky futures contracts will protect your portfolio from unnecessary volatility. By staying informed and strategic, you can position yourself to benefit from what could be an exciting year for the gold market.

Title: Bitcoin is Solidified Happiness!

Time Published: 2024-11-26T19:06:45Z

If you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime! The funny thing is actually… When I was a kid growing up, nobody wanted to own a black car. A sports car was universally red; everyone wanted the red Integra type R, with the gloss white rims. I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing. And you’re going to have to pay that forever. ￼ This is kind of a scary thing… And it seems a little bit weird and unethical; if you own a piece of land, why do you need to pay taxes simply for the right of owning it? Like for example if I own a gold bar, in this gold bar is my property, I don’t have to pay 1% ￼tax on it, simply for owning it, forever? Even in some ways, maybe we consider inflation like an indirect tax on you. For example if you have like $1 million of cash just sitting in a checking account, the reason why this is bad is because it is draining economic energy like 15% a year. For example you’re $1 million worth of cash is going to degrade to like 750,000 the first year, $500,000 the next year, $250,000 the next year, down to $125k the next year etc. kind of a really bad situation. Volatility is energy power and vitality and vigor. Volatility is power! So for example, a nuclear reactor is very very volatile, but it is perhaps maybe one of the best blessings for humankind, because if managed in handled properly, it’s like free electricity and power for everyone forever. Bitcoin is like nuclear economic energy and power. Maybe people are afraid of bitcoin like they are afraid of nuclear power plants. Certainly we do not want a Fukushima,,, but still, certainly in the early adoption years of electricity, I’m sure that there are some people who accidentally electrified themselves to death. ￼ Also, I am also very certain in the early days of fire, there must have been some caveman who were burned to death. Or even the early water wheel, I’m sure there are some people who accidentally got crushed to death by it. But we do not ban these things simply because there were a handful of people who died from it. If you think about Satoshi like being Prometheus, who brought fire to the masses, isn’t this like the greatest blessing of all time? It seems that Michael Saylor and the like talk about Satoshi with some sort of extremely deep reverence. Even I was shocked. Also what becomes very interesting about bitcoin in general is that it definitely is starting to become like religious at this perspective. Like even beyond a cult. Religion. The immaculate conception of bitcoin, Satoshi, giving this gift to humanity, and essentially disappearing forever. Anybody who claims to be Satoshi, ignore them, they certainly are not. Why? Because 1, million bitcoins is essentially like worth what, $200 billion or something, essentially in the next upcoming months and years you’re going to see Satoshi becoming even richer than Elon Musk. And I’m very certain that within the next 5 to 10 years, you’re going to see Michael Saylor maybe being at least 2 to 3 times richer Than even Elon Musk. ￼ Anyways if you have that much energy power in wealth and bitcoins, you are not going to want to have anybody know who you are because realistically your life will probably be in peril. Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me? And the reason why this is such a big deal is once again, now, as a consequence, the cost of living in LA becomes like a joke, really kind of not a big deal, I feel comfortable having 2, 3, 4 or even five kids. ￼￼ Another mistake that people make is that the point of becoming super rich is not to suddenly go out and buy a bunch of silly things. The purpose of the point is instead, to rather, live a more carefree life, less stress less anxieties less annoyance. Dropping $500 on beef ribs at Costco is just like a drop in the bucket. At this point the only money I spend on myself is my weightlifting equipment, my beef ribs, and maybe some new Vibram five fingers when my shoes fall apart. But besides this, I have like no use for money. And once again, the goal is to build in stack capital, we all live in capitalism, not “moneyism”. ERIC KIM CAPITAL a good ring to it. or ERIC KIM KAPITAL Ironically enough it is once again not really about consumerism, if you were a real capitalist, your joy is more in senior capital stack, not seeing it becoming depleted because you bought some sort of loser Ferrari or Porsche. I’m still shocked; 95% of water in America, we are simply being baited along by having some sort of allure of some sort of luxury vehicle but isn’t ideal to be like a digital nomad, traveling to Japan and Kyoto, visiting the Hot Springs, or living this luxurious Expat life in Cambodia Vietnam or Thailand? For example, my friend Todd Hata did it well, he sold his old house in the mountains in LA, and is essentially like on the road 90% of the year, jumping between Mexico City, Thailand, Greece etc. His passion has always been travel, and food and experiences, very wise. Even if you’re the average American, most people cannot afford to purchase physical property. And once again, if you do the math, after homeowners insurance, Tax, fire taxes, ￼ stuff breaking, having to change the roof, getting a new washer and dryer or dishwasher, upgrading your kitchen, you’re going to bleed yourself dry. And not only that but I think being a homeowner becomes a new consumerist things; spent too much time thinking about how to break down walls to extend your home, build an ADU, update the kitchen whatever. Or expanding your garden, changing the flooring etc. But don’t you realize that the best thing to do is just be in nature? Or just drive to the Huntington Gardens on the weekend, or just travel to Japan instead? In fact when you go on a flight, and you see all these little tiny homes From Birds Eye view, you realize how ridiculous the desire of homeownership is. I think real estate will be the next sector that bitcoin gobbles up. The average GenZ person doesn’t care for buying a house, they want to just play pickle ball, go hiking and camping, go on road trips, buy the newest iPhone etc. Pursue their hobbies and passions. Millennials, we are a funny basket case. We used to be like GenZ, wanting to travel to planet, become a digital nomad, etc.… But somewhere along the line, maybe because of Covid, we tried to settle down and buy single-family homes instead? Or condos? I’m starting to feel like this is the early the Internet, AOL, AOL 3.0, you got mail, dial up 56K modems etc. I also like bitcoin because it is just easier to mentally and mathematically remember things. Easier to remember how many bitcoins you have on the top of your head, rather than trying to tabulate all the ones and zeros of all your fake fiat based assets? Rather than thinking about your net worth, easier to just remember your net bitcoins; ￼ Whenever I find out that somebody else is into bitcoin, I have zero issues asking them how many bitcoins they own. Why? Because it is still a relatively new field, it is awkward to ask people how much US dollars they have in their savings account, or checking account, Easier to just ask the bitcoin question. And for me, even owning a single bitcoin is like for me, owning like a square block of digital Manhattan or Kyoto. You know these rich families that own huge plots of land in desirable locations? Yeah, that’s like bitcoin. A single-family home in Beverly Hills is what like at least 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million? 100,000,000? My personal projection is if you tag the price of a bitcoin to desirable real estate in the Brentwood Hills or something, just think about what the land is worth for the Getty museum. Or like owning a piece of land or property next to the PCH in Malibu. But actually if you think about it, the value of a single bitcoin is worth 1 trillion times more than even the best property in Malibu. Why? The dangers of owning physical property, landslides, Robberies, general maintenance. The fear that your housekeeper is stealing your stuff. For example, how comfortable are you leaving your $200,000 Rolex just sitting around? Probably not very comfortable. Bitcoin is the new family jewels. Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ Even here in Culver City, kind of like peak LA, there are so many businesses which are getting shut down like even me and Seneca’s beloved shake shack, and even more shockingly today, chipotle. If these trusted namebrand businesses are struggling in going out of business because we cannot afford to pay the rent or whatever… Isn’t this pretty bad? And also, physical entropy. Once again, if you want a physical house, shit will always break and you’re going to have to be liable for it. If you have an amazing landlord who always fixes everything super fast, even put in brand new appliances for you, leverage and milk that forever. Even we told our landlord that our washer washing machine had a little bit of rust in it, immediately sent in his team and installed a totally brand new Samsung washer and dryer , which might have caused like $5000 $6000? Even another thing that was interesting, there were some palm trees which were growing on top of the roof, and he just sent in a team to get it all cut down and fixed up? Even we had some issues with our electricity and water and water heater, once again he snapped his fingers and got it all resolved in a day or two, while me and Seneca having a fun adventure at the park. For myself, my core competency is within writing thinking blogging vlogging etc. ￼ from an economic perspective it kind of makes no sense for me to waste my time having to manage a home and fix things. I would rather manage thoughts ideas, big visions?

Video podcast Bitcoin and Life Insights by Eric Kim 1. Bitcoin = Happiness • Lock your economic energy into bitcoin for ultimate freedom and security. 2. Digital Nomad Dream • Live untethered in places like Thailand or Mexico City; bitcoin empowers this lifestyle. 3. Vehicles Are Overrated • Skip luxury cars; practical hybrids or plug-in hybrids like a Lexus TX are smarter choices. 4. No to Homeownership • Owning real estate is a liability with taxes, maintenance, and endless costs. 5. Bitcoin > Real Estate • Bitcoin is digital property: no taxes, no maintenance, no physical risks. 6. Volatility is Power • Like fire or nuclear energy, bitcoin’s volatility is its strength, not a weakness. 7. Satoshi as Modern Prometheus • Bitcoin is a gift to humanity, like fire; respect its profound impact. 8. Capitalism and Bitcoin • True joy in capitalism is stacking capital (bitcoin) rather than depleting it on liabilities. 9. New Digital Assets • Bitcoin is like owning digital Manhattan or Kyoto—immortal, divisible, and untouchable. 10. Physical Assets are Weak • Rolexes, Porsches, and physical homes are liabilities compared to the strength of bitcoin. 11. Generational Shift • Gen Z values experiences over homeownership; millennials should rethink settling down. 12. Bitcoin is the New Internet • We’re in bitcoin’s early AOL days—don’t miss out. 13. Future of Bitcoin • A single bitcoin could be worth $55M+; funnel your wealth into it now. 14. Economic Buffer • Use wealth to eliminate stress, not for consumerism—be Spartan and focused. 15. Blockchain > Physical Vaults • The blockchain is the new cloud; bitcoin is the ultimate security. 16. Markets Should Be Free • Imagine trading stocks or bitcoin 24/7—total freedom. 17. Leverage Renting • If your landlord is great, maximize that advantage—don’t rush to own property. 18. Focus on Strengths • Free your time from managing physical assets; focus on big ideas and your unique talents. Bitcoin is the future—stack it, live free, and build your life around what truly matters. *** Do you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime! The funny thing is actually… When I was a kid growing up, nobody wanted to own a black car. A sports car was universally red; everyone wanted the red Integra type R, with the gloss white rims. I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing. And you’re going to have to pay that forever. ￼ This is kind of a scary thing… And it seems a little bit weird and unethical; if you own a piece of land, why do you need to pay taxes simply for the right of owning it? Like for example if I own a gold bar, in this gold bar is my property, I don’t have to pay 1% ￼tax on it, simply for owning it, forever? Even in some ways, maybe we consider inflation like an indirect tax on you. For example if you have like $1 million of cash just sitting in a checking account, the reason why this is bad is because it is draining economic energy like 15% a year. For example you’re $1 million worth of cash is going to degrade to like 750,000 the first year, $500,000 the next year, $250,000 the next year, down to $125k the next year etc. kind of a really bad situation. Volatility is energy power and vitality and vigor. Volatility is power! So for example, a nuclear reactor is very very volatile, but it is perhaps maybe one of the best blessings for humankind, because if managed in handled properly, it’s like free electricity and power for everyone forever. Bitcoin is like nuclear economic energy and power. Maybe people are afraid of bitcoin like they are afraid of nuclear power plants. Certainly we do not want a Fukushima,,, but still, certainly in the early adoption years of electricity, I’m sure that there are some people who accidentally electrified themselves to death. ￼ Also, I am also very certain in the early days of fire, there must have been some caveman who were burned to death. Or even the early water wheel, I’m sure there are some people who accidentally got crushed to death by it. But we do not ban these things simply because there were a handful of people who died from it. If you think about Satoshi like being Prometheus, who brought fire to the masses, isn’t this like the greatest blessing of all time? It seems that Michael Saylor and the like talk about Satoshi with some sort of extremely deep reverence. Even I was shocked. Also what becomes very interesting about bitcoin in general is that it definitely is starting to become like religious at this perspective. Like even beyond a cult. Religion. The immaculate conception of bitcoin, Satoshi, giving this gift to humanity, and essentially disappearing forever. Anybody who claims to be Satoshi, ignore them, they certainly are not. Why? Because 1, million bitcoins is essentially like worth what, $200 billion or something, essentially in the next upcoming months and years you’re going to see Satoshi becoming even richer than Elon Musk. And I’m very certain that within the next 5 to 10 years, you’re going to see Michael Saylor maybe being at least 2 to 3 times richer Than even Elon Musk. ￼ Anyways if you have that much energy power in wealth and bitcoins, you are not going to want to have anybody know who you are because realistically your life will probably be in peril. Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me? And the reason why this is such a big deal is once again, now, as a consequence, the cost of living in LA becomes like a joke, really kind of not a big deal, I feel comfortable having 2, 3, 4 or even five kids. ￼￼ Another mistake that people make is that the point of becoming super rich is not to suddenly go out and buy a bunch of silly things. The purpose of the point is instead, to rather, live a more carefree life, less stress less anxieties less annoyance. Dropping $500 on beef ribs at Costco is just like a drop in the bucket. At this point the only money I spend on myself is my weightlifting equipment, my beef ribs, and maybe some new Vibram five fingers when my shoes fall apart. But besides this, I have like no use for money. And once again, the goal is to build in stack capital, we all live in capitalism, not “moneyism”. ERIC KIM CAPITAL a good ring to it. or ERIC KIM KAPITAL Ironically enough it is once again not really about consumerism, if you were a real capitalist, your joy is more in senior capital stack, not seeing it becoming depleted because you bought some sort of loser Ferrari or Porsche. I’m still shocked; 95% of water in America, we are simply being baited along by having some sort of allure of some sort of luxury vehicle but isn’t ideal to be like a digital nomad, traveling to Japan and Kyoto, visiting the Hot Springs, or living this luxurious Expat life in Cambodia Vietnam or Thailand? For example, my friend Todd Hata did it well, he sold his old house in the mountains in LA, and is essentially like on the road 90% of the year, jumping between Mexico City, Thailand, Greece etc. His passion has always been travel, and food and experiences, very wise. Even if you’re the average American, most people cannot afford to purchase physical property. And once again, if you do the math, after homeowners insurance, Tax, fire taxes, ￼ stuff breaking, having to change the roof, getting a new washer and dryer or dishwasher, upgrading your kitchen, you’re going to bleed yourself dry. And not only that but I think being a homeowner becomes a new consumerist things; spent too much time thinking about how to break down walls to extend your home, build an ADU, update the kitchen whatever. Or expanding your garden, changing the flooring etc. But don’t you realize that the best thing to do is just be in nature? Or just drive to the Huntington Gardens on the weekend, or just travel to Japan instead? In fact when you go on a flight, and you see all these little tiny homes From Birds Eye view, you realize how ridiculous the desire of homeownership is. I think real estate will be the next sector that bitcoin gobbles up. The average GenZ person doesn’t care for buying a house, they want to just play pickle ball, go hiking and camping, go on road trips, buy the newest iPhone etc. Pursue their hobbies and passions. Millennials, we are a funny basket case. We used to be like GenZ, wanting to travel to planet, become a digital nomad, etc.… But somewhere along the line, maybe because of Covid, we tried to settle down and buy single-family homes instead? Or condos? I’m starting to feel like this is the early the Internet, AOL, AOL 3.0, you got mail, dial up 56K modems etc. I also like bitcoin because it is just easier to mentally and mathematically remember things. Easier to remember how many bitcoins you have on the top of your head, rather than trying to tabulate all the ones and zeros of all your fake fiat based assets? Rather than thinking about your net worth, easier to just remember your net bitcoins; ￼ Whenever I find out that somebody else is into bitcoin, I have zero issues asking them how many bitcoins they own. Why? Because it is still a relatively new field, it is awkward to ask people how much US dollars they have in their savings account, or checking account, Easier to just ask the bitcoin question. And for me, even owning a single bitcoin is like for me, owning like a square block of digital Manhattan or Kyoto. You know these rich families that own huge plots of land in desirable locations? Yeah, that’s like bitcoin. A single-family home in Beverly Hills is what like at least 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million? 100,000,000? My personal projection is if you tag the price of a bitcoin to desirable real estate in the Brentwood Hills or something, just think about what the land is worth for the Getty museum. Or like owning a piece of land or property next to the PCH in Malibu. But actually if you think about it, the value of a single bitcoin is worth 1 trillion times more than even the best property in Malibu. Why? The dangers of owning physical property, landslides, Robberies, general maintenance. The fear that your housekeeper is stealing your stuff. For example, how comfortable are you leaving your $200,000 Rolex just sitting around? Probably not very comfortable. Bitcoin is the new family jewels. Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay?

Trump's campaign promises — from tariffs to mass deportations, tax cuts and deregulation — and his picks to lead federal agencies suggest both risks and rewards for various investment sectors, according to market experts. Republican control of both chambers of Congress may grant Trump greater leeway to enact his pledges, experts said. However, their scope and timing is far from clear. Here's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business. "There's so much uncertainty right now," said Jeremy Goldberg, a certified financial planner, portfolio manager and research analyst at Professional Advisory Services, which ranked No. 37 on CNBC's annual Financial Advisor 100 list. "I wouldn't be making large bets one way or another," Goldberg said. Past market results show why it's difficult to predict the sectors that may win or lose under a new president, according to Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James. When Trump was elected in 2016, financials, industrials and energy outperformed the S&P 500 in the first week. However, for the remaining three years and 51 weeks, those same sectors significantly underperformed, Adam said. "The market is known to have these knee-jerk reactions trying to anticipate where things go very quickly, but they don't necessarily last," Adam said. What's more, sectors that are expected to do well or badly based on a president's policies have sometimes gone the opposite way, according to Adam. For example, the energy sector was down by 8.4% during Trump's first administration, despite deregulation, record oil production and a rise in oil prices. Yet the energy sector climbed 22.9% under Biden as of Nov. 19, despite the administration's push for renewables and sustainability. For that reason, Raymond James ranks politics eighth for its potential impact on sectors. The seven factors that have more influence, according to the firm, are economic growth, fundamentals, monetary policy, interest rates and inflation, valuations, sentiment and corporate activity. Here's how Trump's policy stances could influence eight sectors: autos, banks, building materials and construction, cryptocurrency, energy, health care, retail and technology. The auto sector — like many others — will likely be a mixed bag, experts said. Trump's antipathy for electric vehicles is likely to create headwinds for EV producers. His administration may try to roll back regulations such as a Biden-era tailpipe-emissions rule expected to push broader adoption of EVs and hybrids. He also intends to kill consumer EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 — although states such as California may try to enact their own EV rebates, blunting the impact. Losing the federal credit would make EVs more costly, driving down sales and perhaps making "per unit economics even less favorable" for automakers, John Murphy, a research analyst at Bank of America Securities, wrote in a Nov. 21 research note. Some companies seem well-positioned, though: Ford Motor, for example, "has a healthy pipeline of hybrid vehicles as well as traditional [internal combustion engine] vehicles to supplement the EV offerings," Murphy wrote. Tariffs and trade conflict pose threats to the auto industry, since the U.S. relies heavily on other nations to manufacture cars and parts, said Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management. They "could affect the cost and availability of cars we see in the U.S. market," Cox said. Economists expect tariffs and other Trump policies to be inflationary. In that case, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. Higher borrowing costs may weigh on consumers' desire or ability to buy cars, Cox said. However, lower EV production could be a boon for companies that manufacture traditional gasoline cars, experts said. Trump has also called for a "drill, baby, drill" approach to oil production. Greater supply could reduce gas prices, supporting demand for gas vehicles, experts said. But trade wars and sanctions on Iran and Venezuela could have the opposite impact, too. — Greg Iacurci Trump's first administration eased certain regulations for banking rules, fintech firms and financial startups. Likewise, Trump's second term is expected to usher in lighter financial regulations. That may help bolster profitability in the sector, and therefore stock prices, said Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at Halbert Hargrove in Long Beach, California, which is No. 54 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. "The larger banks probably benefit more from that," Spinelli said. Less regulation — combined with the prospect that interest rates could stay higher — will provide a net positive for the bank industry, since banks may be able to lend out more risk-based capital, said David Rea, president of Salem Investment Counselors in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which is No. 8 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. One issue that emerged this year that could resurface is concern about regional banks' exposure to commercial real estate, Spinelli said. "It wasn't that long ago, and I don't think those problems disappeared," Spinelli said. "So you question, is that still looming out there?" — Lorie Konish The housing market has been "frozen" in recent years by high mortgage rates, said Cox, of Ritholtz. Lower rates would likely be a "catalyst" for housing and associated companies, she said. However, that may not materialize — quickly, at least — under Trump, she said. If policies such as tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportations stoke inflation, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated, which would likely prop up mortgage rates and weigh on housing and related sectors, she said. The whims of the housing market affect retailers, too: Home goods stores may not fare well if people aren't buying, renovating and decorating new homes, Cox said. That said, deregulation could be "absolutely huge" for the sector if it accelerates building timelines and reduces costs for developers, Goldberg said. Trump has called for opening public land to builders and creating tax incentives for homebuyers, without providing much detail. Housing policy will be "one of the most-watched initiatives coming out of the next administration," Cox said. "We haven't gotten a lot of clarity on that front." "If we see realistic and well-thought-out policies, you could see real estate stocks and related stocks" such as real estate investment trusts, home improvement retailers and home builders respond well, Cox said. — Greg Iacurci Trump's election has brought a new bullishness to cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin nearing a new $100,000 benchmark before its recent runup ended. As president, Trump is expected to embrace crypto more than any of his predecessors. Notably, he has already launched a crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, that will encourage the use of digital coins. Those developments come as new ways of investing in crypto have emerged this year, with the January launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, and more recently, the addition of bitcoin ETF options. Yet financial advisors are hesitant, with only about 2.6% recommending crypto to their clients, an April survey from Cerulli Associates found. Roughly 12.1% said they would be willing to use it or discuss it based on the client's preference. Still, 58.9% of advisors said they do not expect to ever use cryptocurrency with clients. "The No. 1 reason why advisors aren't investing in cryptocurrency on behalf of their clients is they don't believe it's suitable for client portfolios," said Matt Apkarian, associate director in Cerulli's product development practice. Even for advisors who do expect they may use crypto at some point, it's "wait and see," particularly regarding how the regulatory environment plays out, Apkarian said. However, investors are showing interest in cryptocurrency, with 90% of advisors receiving questions on the subject, according to research from Christina Lynn, a certified financial planner and practice management consultant at Mariner Wealth Advisors. For those investors, exchange-traded funds are a good starting place, Lynn said, since there's less chance of falling victim to one of crypto's pitfalls such as scams or losing the keys, the unique alphanumeric codes attached to the investments. Because crypto can be more volatile, it's best not to invest any money you expect you'll need to pay for near-term goals, she said. Investors would also be wise to think of cryptocurrency like an alternative investment and limit the allocation to 1% to 5% of their overall portfolio, Lynn said. "You don't need to have a lot of this to have it go a long way," Lynn said. — Lorie Konish As of Nov. 19, energy has been the top-performing sector under President Joe Biden, with a 22.9% gain, even with the administration's push for renewables and sustainability, according to Raymond James. Yet it remains to be seen whether that performance can continue under Trump, who has advocated for more oil, gas and coal production. The outlook for the sector could change if Trump acts on a campaign threat to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, a law enacted under Biden that includes clean energy incentives. If Trump continues to make it easier to create more oil supply, that might not be a great thing for oil companies, according to Adam, of Raymond James. "Because there's more supply, it may tamp down on the price of oil, and that's one of the biggest drivers of that sector," Adam said. Eagle Global Advisors, a Houston-based investment management firm that specializes in energy infrastructure, is "cautiously optimistic" about Trump's impact on the sector, according to portfolio manager Mike Cerasoli. Eagle Global Advisors is No. 35 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. "We would say we're probably more on the optimistic side than the cautious side," Cerasoli said. "But if we know anything about Trump it's that he's a wild card." A lot of the Inflation Reduction Act may stay intact, since the top states that benefited financially from the law also handed Trump a victory in the election, according to Cerasoli. When Biden won in 2020, there was a lot of panic about the outlook for energy, oil and gas. Cerasoli recalls writing in a third-quarter letter that year, "I don't think it's going to be as bad as you think." Four years later, he has the same message for investors on the outlook for renewables. In the days following Trump's inauguration, Cerasoli expects there may be a deluge of executive orders. "Once you get past that, you'll get a sense of exactly how he's going to treat energy," Cerasoli said. "I think people will realize that it's not the end of the world for renewables." — Lorie Konish Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. RFK would be a "huge wild card" for the health-care sector if the U.S. Senate were to confirm him, said Goldberg, of Professional Advisory Services. RFK is a prominent vaccine skeptic, which may bode ill for big vaccine makers such as Merck, Pfizer and Moderna, said David Weinstein, a portfolio manager and senior vice president at Dana Investment Advisors, No. 4 on CNBC's annual FA 100 ranking. Cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, are also likely on the table to reduce government spending and raise money for a tax-cut package, experts said. Publicly traded health companies such as Centene, HCA Healthcare and UnitedHealth might be affected by lower volumes of Medicaid patients or consumers who face higher health-care premiums after losing ACA subsidies, for example, Weinstein said. Medical tech providers — especially those that supply electronics with semiconductors sourced from China — could be burdened by tariffs, he added. Conversely, deregulation might help certain pharmaceutical companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific and Charles River Laboratories, which may benefit from faster approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, Goldberg said. Vivek Ramaswamy, a former biotech executive whom Trump appointed as co-head of a new advisory panel called the "Department of Government Efficiency," has called for streamlined drug approvals. But Kennedy has advocated for more oversight. "There's a real dichotomy here," Weinstein said. "Where do we end up? Maybe where we are right now," he added. — Greg Iacurci Tax cuts may boost consumers' discretionary income, which would be a boon for companies selling consumer electronics, clothes, luxury goods and other items, Goldberg said. Then again, there's a "high probability" of tariffs, Weinstein said. Retailers would likely pass on at least some of that additional cost to consumers, experts said. All physical goods, from apparel to footwear, tools and appliances are at risk from tariffs, Weinstein said. Tariff impact would depend on how the policies are structured. Home Depot, Lowe's and Walmart, for example, source a relatively big chunk of their goods from abroad, Weinstein said. Home Depot CEO and President Ted Decker said Nov. 12 during the firm's third-quarter earnings call that the company sources more than half its goods from the U.S. and North America, but "there certainly will be an impact." "Whatever happens in tariffs will be an industrywide impact," Decker said. "It won't discriminate against different retailers and distributors who are importing goods." It's a good idea for investors to own "high quality" retailers without a lot of debt and with diversified inventory sources, Goldberg said. He cited TJX Companies, which owns stores including TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, as an example. "Direct imports are a small portion of [its] business and TJX sources from a variety of countries outside of China," Lorraine Hutchinson, a Bank of America Securities research analyst, wrote in a Nov. 21 note. Deregulation may be positive for smaller retailers and franchises, which tend to be more sensitive to labor laws and environmental and compliance costs, Goldberg said. — Greg Iacurci The technology sector continued its strong run in 2024, thanks in large part to the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Even broadly diversified investors may find it difficult to escape those names, as they are among the top weighted companies in the S&P 500 index. Information technology — which includes all those stocks except Amazon and Google parent Alphabet — comprises the largest sector in the S&P 500 index, with more than 31%. Trump is poised to have an influence on looming antitrust issues, amid considerations as to whether Google's influence on online search should be limited. Any tariffs put in place may also prompt some sales to decline or the cost of raw materials to go up, said Rea of Salem Investment Counselors. Nevertheless, Rea said his firm continues to have a "pretty heavy" tech allocation, with strong expectations for generative artificial intelligence. However, the firm does not own Tesla, due to its expensive valuation, and has recently been selling software company Palantir, a winning stock that may have gotten ahead of itself, he said. Technology valuations are trading well into the high double digits on a price-to-earnings basis, which often signals forward returns will decline, according to Halbert Hargrove's Spinelli. Consequently, prospective investors who come in now would basically be buying high, he said. "If you think you're going to get the same double-digit returns in the next five years, sure, it could happen on a one-year basis," Spinelli said. "But your chances historically have been that your returns come down." — Lorie Konish Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Trump's campaign promises — from tariffs to mass deportations, tax cuts and deregulation — and his picks to lead federal agencies suggest both risks and rewards for various investment sectors, according to market experts. Republican control of both chambers of Congress may grant Trump greater leeway to enact his pledges, experts said. However, their scope and timing is far from clear. Here's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business. "There's so much uncertainty right now," said Jeremy Goldberg, a certified financial planner, portfolio manager and research analyst at Professional Advisory Services, which ranked No. 37 on CNBC's annual Financial Advisor 100 list. "I wouldn't be making large bets one way or another," Goldberg said. Past market results show why it's difficult to predict the sectors that may win or lose under a new president, according to Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James. When Trump was elected in 2016, financials, industrials and energy outperformed the S&P 500 in the first week. However, for the remaining three years and 51 weeks, those same sectors significantly underperformed, Adam said. "The market is known to have these knee-jerk reactions trying to anticipate where things go very quickly, but they don't necessarily last," Adam said. What's more, sectors that are expected to do well or badly based on a president's policies have sometimes gone the opposite way, according to Adam. For example, the energy sector was down by 8.4% during Trump's first administration, despite deregulation, record oil production and a rise in oil prices. Yet the energy sector climbed 22.9% under Biden as of Nov. 19, despite the administration's push for renewables and sustainability. For that reason, Raymond James ranks politics eighth for its potential impact on sectors. The seven factors that have more influence, according to the firm, are economic growth, fundamentals, monetary policy, interest rates and inflation, valuations, sentiment and corporate activity. Here's how Trump's policy stances could influence eight sectors: autos, banks, building materials and construction, cryptocurrency, energy, health care, retail and technology. The auto sector — like many others — will likely be a mixed bag, experts said. Trump's antipathy for electric vehicles is likely to create headwinds for EV producers. His administration may try to roll back regulations such as a Biden-era tailpipe-emissions rule expected to push broader adoption of EVs and hybrids. He also intends to kill consumer EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 — although states such as California may try to enact their own EV rebates, blunting the impact. Losing the federal credit would make EVs more costly, driving down sales and perhaps making "per unit economics even less favorable" for automakers, John Murphy, a research analyst at Bank of America Securities, wrote in a Nov. 21 research note. Some companies seem well-positioned, though: Ford Motor, for example, "has a healthy pipeline of hybrid vehicles as well as traditional [internal combustion engine] vehicles to supplement the EV offerings," Murphy wrote. Tariffs and trade conflict pose threats to the auto industry, since the U.S. relies heavily on other nations to manufacture cars and parts, said Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management. They "could affect the cost and availability of cars we see in the U.S. market," Cox said. Economists expect tariffs and other Trump policies to be inflationary. In that case, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. Higher borrowing costs may weigh on consumers' desire or ability to buy cars, Cox said. However, lower EV production could be a boon for companies that manufacture traditional gasoline cars, experts said. Trump has also called for a "drill, baby, drill" approach to oil production. Greater supply could reduce gas prices, supporting demand for gas vehicles, experts said. But trade wars and sanctions on Iran and Venezuela could have the opposite impact, too. — Greg Iacurci Trump's first administration eased certain regulations for banking rules, fintech firms and financial startups. Likewise, Trump's second term is expected to usher in lighter financial regulations. That may help bolster profitability in the sector, and therefore stock prices, said Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at Halbert Hargrove in Long Beach, California, which is No. 54 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. "The larger banks probably benefit more from that," Spinelli said. Less regulation — combined with the prospect that interest rates could stay higher — will provide a net positive for the bank industry, since banks may be able to lend out more risk-based capital, said David Rea, president of Salem Investment Counselors in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which is No. 8 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. One issue that emerged this year that could resurface is concern about regional banks' exposure to commercial real estate, Spinelli said. "It wasn't that long ago, and I don't think those problems disappeared," Spinelli said. "So you question, is that still looming out there?" — Lorie Konish The housing market has been "frozen" in recent years by high mortgage rates, said Cox, of Ritholtz. Lower rates would likely be a "catalyst" for housing and associated companies, she said. However, that may not materialize — quickly, at least — under Trump, she said. If policies such as tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportations stoke inflation, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated, which would likely prop up mortgage rates and weigh on housing and related sectors, she said. The whims of the housing market affect retailers, too: Home goods stores may not fare well if people aren't buying, renovating and decorating new homes, Cox said. That said, deregulation could be "absolutely huge" for the sector if it accelerates building timelines and reduces costs for developers, Goldberg said. Trump has called for opening public land to builders and creating tax incentives for homebuyers, without providing much detail. Housing policy will be "one of the most-watched initiatives coming out of the next administration," Cox said. "We haven't gotten a lot of clarity on that front." "If we see realistic and well-thought-out policies, you could see real estate stocks and related stocks" such as real estate investment trusts, home improvement retailers and home builders respond well, Cox said. — Greg Iacurci Trump's election has brought a new bullishness to cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin nearing a new $100,000 benchmark before its recent runup ended. As president, Trump is expected to embrace crypto more than any of his predecessors. Notably, he has already launched a crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, that will encourage the use of digital coins. Those developments come as new ways of investing in crypto have emerged this year, with the January launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, and more recently, the addition of bitcoin ETF options. Yet financial advisors are hesitant, with only about 2.6% recommending crypto to their clients, an April survey from Cerulli Associates found. Roughly 12.1% said they would be willing to use it or discuss it based on the client's preference. Still, 58.9% of advisors said they do not expect to ever use cryptocurrency with clients. "The No. 1 reason why advisors aren't investing in cryptocurrency on behalf of their clients is they don't believe it's suitable for client portfolios," said Matt Apkarian, associate director in Cerulli's product development practice. Even for advisors who do expect they may use crypto at some point, it's "wait and see," particularly regarding how the regulatory environment plays out, Apkarian said. However, investors are showing interest in cryptocurrency, with 90% of advisors receiving questions on the subject, according to research from Christina Lynn, a certified financial planner and practice management consultant at Mariner Wealth Advisors. For those investors, exchange-traded funds are a good starting place, Lynn said, since there's less chance of falling victim to one of crypto's pitfalls such as scams or losing the keys, the unique alphanumeric codes attached to the investments. Because crypto can be more volatile, it's best not to invest any money you expect you'll need to pay for near-term goals, she said. Investors would also be wise to think of cryptocurrency like an alternative investment and limit the allocation to 1% to 5% of their overall portfolio, Lynn said. "You don't need to have a lot of this to have it go a long way," Lynn said. — Lorie Konish As of Nov. 19, energy has been the top-performing sector under President Joe Biden, with a 22.9% gain, even with the administration's push for renewables and sustainability, according to Raymond James.

Title: Bitcoin is Solidified Happiness

Happy Bitcoin! Audio Happiness is forever, if in a Bitcoin! — Do you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime! The funny thing is actually… When I was a kid growing up, nobody wanted to own a black car. A sports car was universally red; everyone wanted the red Integra type R, with the gloss white rims. I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing. And you’re going to have to pay that forever. ￼ This is kind of a scary thing… And it seems a little bit weird and unethical; if you own a piece of land, why do you need to pay taxes simply for the right of owning it? Like for example if I own a gold bar, in this gold bar is my property, I don’t have to pay 1% ￼tax on it, simply for owning it, forever? Even in some ways, maybe we consider inflation like an indirect tax on you. For example if you have like $1 million of cash just sitting in a checking account, the reason why this is bad is because it is draining economic energy like 15% a year. For example you’re $1 million worth of cash is going to degrade to like 750,000 the first year, $500,000 the next year, $250,000 the next year, down to $125k the next year etc. kind of a really bad situation. Volatility is energy power and vitality and vigor. Volatility is power! So for example, a nuclear reactor is very very volatile, but it is perhaps maybe one of the best blessings for humankind, because if managed in handled properly, it’s like free electricity and power for everyone forever. Bitcoin is like nuclear economic energy and power. Maybe people are afraid of bitcoin like they are afraid of nuclear power plants. Certainly we do not want a Fukushima,,, but still, certainly in the early adoption years of electricity, I’m sure that there are some people who accidentally electrified themselves to death. ￼ Also, I am also very certain in the early days of fire, there must have been some caveman who were burned to death. Or even the early water wheel, I’m sure there are some people who accidentally got crushed to death by it. But we do not ban these things simply because there were a handful of people who died from it. If you think about Satoshi like being Prometheus, who brought fire to the masses, isn’t this like the greatest blessing of all time? It seems that Michael Saylor and the like talk about Satoshi with some sort of extremely deep reverence. Even I was shocked. Also what becomes very interesting about bitcoin in general is that it definitely is starting to become like religious at this perspective. Like even beyond a cult. Religion. The immaculate conception of bitcoin, Satoshi, giving this gift to humanity, and essentially disappearing forever. Anybody who claims to be Satoshi, ignore them, they certainly are not. Why? Because 1, million bitcoins is essentially like worth what, $200 billion or something, essentially in the next upcoming months and years you’re going to see Satoshi becoming even richer than Elon Musk. And I’m very certain that within the next 5 to 10 years, you’re going to see Michael Saylor maybe being at least 2 to 3 times richer Than even Elon Musk. ￼ Anyways if you have that much energy power in wealth and bitcoins, you are not going to want to have anybody know who you are because realistically your life will probably be in peril. Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me? And the reason why this is such a big deal is once again, now, as a consequence, the cost of living in LA becomes like a joke, really kind of not a big deal, I feel comfortable having 2, 3, 4 or even five kids. ￼￼ Another mistake that people make is that the point of becoming super rich is not to suddenly go out and buy a bunch of silly things. The purpose of the point is instead, to rather, live a more carefree life, less stress less anxieties less annoyance. Dropping $500 on beef ribs at Costco is just like a drop in the bucket. At this point the only money I spend on myself is my weightlifting equipment, my beef ribs, and maybe some new Vibram five fingers when my shoes fall apart. But besides this, I have like no use for money. And once again, the goal is to build in stack capital, we all live in capitalism, not “moneyism”. ERIC KIM CAPITAL a good ring to it. or ERIC KIM KAPITAL Ironically enough it is once again not really about consumerism, if you were a real capitalist, your joy is more in senior capital stack, not seeing it becoming depleted because you bought some sort of loser Ferrari or Porsche. I’m still shocked; 95% of water in America, we are simply being baited along by having some sort of allure of some sort of luxury vehicle but isn’t ideal to be like a digital nomad, traveling to Japan and Kyoto, visiting the Hot Springs, or living this luxurious Expat life in Cambodia Vietnam or Thailand? For example, my friend Todd Hata did it well, he sold his old house in the mountains in LA, and is essentially like on the road 90% of the year, jumping between Mexico City, Thailand, Greece etc. His passion has always been travel, and food and experiences, very wise. Even if you’re the average American, most people cannot afford to purchase physical property. And once again, if you do the math, after homeowners insurance, Tax, fire taxes, ￼ stuff breaking, having to change the roof, getting a new washer and dryer or dishwasher, upgrading your kitchen, you’re going to bleed yourself dry. And not only that but I think being a homeowner becomes a new consumerist things; spent too much time thinking about how to break down walls to extend your home, build an ADU, update the kitchen whatever. Or expanding your garden, changing the flooring etc. But don’t you realize that the best thing to do is just be in nature? Or just drive to the Huntington Gardens on the weekend, or just travel to Japan instead? In fact when you go on a flight, and you see all these little tiny homes From Birds Eye view, you realize how ridiculous the desire of homeownership is. I think real estate will be the next sector that bitcoin gobbles up. The average GenZ person doesn’t care for buying a house, they want to just play pickle ball, go hiking and camping, go on road trips, buy the newest iPhone etc. Pursue their hobbies and passions. Millennials, we are a funny basket case. We used to be like GenZ, wanting to travel to planet, become a digital nomad, etc.… But somewhere along the line, maybe because of Covid, we tried to settle down and buy single-family homes instead? Or condos? I’m starting to feel like this is the early the Internet, AOL, AOL 3.0, you got mail, dial up 56K modems etc. I also like bitcoin because it is just easier to mentally and mathematically remember things. Easier to remember how many bitcoins you have on the top of your head, rather than trying to tabulate all the ones and zeros of all your fake fiat based assets? Rather than thinking about your net worth, easier to just remember your net bitcoins; ￼ Whenever I find out that somebody else is into bitcoin, I have zero issues asking them how many bitcoins they own. Why? Because it is still a relatively new field, it is awkward to ask people how much US dollars they have in their savings account, or checking account, Easier to just ask the bitcoin question. And for me, even owning a single bitcoin is like for me, owning like a square block of digital Manhattan or Kyoto. You know these rich families that own huge plots of land in desirable locations? Yeah, that’s like bitcoin. A single-family home in Beverly Hills is what like at least 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million? 100,000,000? My personal projection is if you tag the price of a bitcoin to desirable real estate in the Brentwood Hills or something, just think about what the land is worth for the Getty museum. Or like owning a piece of land or property next to the PCH in Malibu. But actually if you think about it, the value of a single bitcoin is worth 1 trillion times more than even the best property in Malibu. Why? The dangers of owning physical property, landslides, Robberies, general maintenance. The fear that your housekeeper is stealing your stuff. For example, how comfortable are you leaving your $200,000 Rolex just sitting around? Probably not very comfortable. Bitcoin is the new family jewels. Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ Even here in Culver City, kind of like peak LA, there are so many businesses which are getting shut down like even me and Seneca’s beloved shake shack, and even more shockingly today, chipotle. If these trusted namebrand businesses are struggling in going out of business because we cannot afford to pay the rent or whatever… Isn’t this pretty bad? And also, physical entropy. Once again, if you want a physical house, shit will always break and you’re going to have to be liable for it. If you have an amazing landlord who always fixes everything super fast, even put in brand new appliances for you, leverage and milk that forever. Even we told our landlord that our washer washing machine had a little bit of rust in it, immediately sent in his team and installed a totally brand new Samsung washer and dryer , which might have caused like $5000 $6000? Even another thing that was interesting, there were some palm trees which were growing on top of the roof, and he just sent in a team to get it all cut down and fixed up? Even we had some issues with our electricity and water and water heater, once again he snapped his fingers and got it all resolved in a day or two, while me and Seneca having a fun adventure at the park. For myself, my core competency is within writing thinking blogging vlogging etc. ￼ from an economic perspective it kind of makes no sense for me to waste my time having to manage a home and fix things. I would rather manage thoughts ideas, big visions? When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: Bitcoin is Solidified Happiness

Time Published: 2024-11-26T16:50:03Z
Full Content:
Do you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime! The funny thing is actually… When I was a kid growing up, nobody wanted to own a black car. A sports car was universally red; everyone wanted the red Integra type R, with the gloss white rims. I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing. And you’re going to have to pay that forever. ￼ This is kind of a scary thing… And it seems a little bit weird and unethical; if you own a piece of land, why do you need to pay taxes simply for the right of owning it? Like for example if I own a gold bar, in this gold bar is my property, I don’t have to pay 1% ￼tax on it, simply for owning it, forever? Even in some ways, maybe we consider inflation like an indirect tax on you. For example if you have like $1 million of cash just sitting in a checking account, the reason why this is bad is because it is draining economic energy like 15% a year. For example you’re $1 million worth of cash is going to degrade to like 750,000 the first year, $500,000 the next year, $250,000 the next year, down to $125k the next year etc. kind of a really bad situation. Volatility is energy power and vitality and vigor. Volatility is power! So for example, a nuclear reactor is very very volatile, but it is perhaps maybe one of the best blessings for humankind, because if managed in handled properly, it’s like free electricity and power for everyone forever. Bitcoin is like nuclear economic energy and power. Maybe people are afraid of bitcoin like they are afraid of nuclear power plants. Certainly we do not want a Fukushima,,, but still, certainly in the early adoption years of electricity, I’m sure that there are some people who accidentally electrified themselves to death. ￼ Also, I am also very certain in the early days of fire, there must have been some caveman who were burned to death. Or even the early water wheel, I’m sure there are some people who accidentally got crushed to death by it. But we do not ban these things simply because there were a handful of people who died from it. If you think about Satoshi like being Prometheus, who brought fire to the masses, isn’t this like the greatest blessing of all time? It seems that Michael Saylor and the like talk about Satoshi with some sort of extremely deep reverence. Even I was shocked. Also what becomes very interesting about bitcoin in general is that it definitely is starting to become like religious at this perspective. Like even beyond a cult. Religion. The immaculate conception of bitcoin, Satoshi, giving this gift to humanity, and essentially disappearing forever. Anybody who claims to be Satoshi, ignore them, they certainly are not. Why? Because 1, million bitcoins is essentially like worth what, $200 billion or something, essentially in the next upcoming months and years you’re going to see Satoshi becoming even richer than Elon Musk. And I’m very certain that within the next 5 to 10 years, you’re going to see Michael Saylor maybe being at least 2 to 3 times richer Than even Elon Musk. ￼ Anyways if you have that much energy power in wealth and bitcoins, you are not going to want to have anybody know who you are because realistically your life will probably be in peril. Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me? And the reason why this is such a big deal is once again, now, as a consequence, the cost of living in LA becomes like a joke, really kind of not a big deal, I feel comfortable having 2, 3, 4 or even five kids. ￼￼ Another mistake that people make is that the point of becoming super rich is not to suddenly go out and buy a bunch of silly things. The purpose of the point is instead, to rather, live a more carefree life, less stress less anxieties less annoyance. Dropping $500 on beef ribs at Costco is just like a drop in the bucket. At this point the only money I spend on myself is my weightlifting equipment, my beef ribs, and maybe some new Vibram five fingers when my shoes fall apart. But besides this, I have like no use for money. And once again, the goal is to build in stack capital, we all live in capitalism, not “moneyism”. ERIC KIM CAPITAL a good ring to it. or ERIC KIM KAPITAL Ironically enough it is once again not really about consumerism, if you were a real capitalist, your joy is more in senior capital stack, not seeing it becoming depleted because you bought some sort of loser Ferrari or Porsche. I’m still shocked; 95% of water in America, we are simply being baited along by having some sort of allure of some sort of luxury vehicle but isn’t ideal to be like a digital nomad, traveling to Japan and Kyoto, visiting the Hot Springs, or living this luxurious Expat life in Cambodia Vietnam or Thailand? For example, my friend Todd Hata did it well, he sold his old house in the mountains in LA, and is essentially like on the road 90% of the year, jumping between Mexico City, Thailand, Greece etc. His passion has always been travel, and food and experiences, very wise. Even if you’re the average American, most people cannot afford to purchase physical property. And once again, if you do the math, after homeowners insurance, Tax, fire taxes, ￼ stuff breaking, having to change the roof, getting a new washer and dryer or dishwasher, upgrading your kitchen, you’re going to bleed yourself dry. And not only that but I think being a homeowner becomes a new consumerist things; spent too much time thinking about how to break down walls to extend your home, build an ADU, update the kitchen whatever. Or expanding your garden, changing the flooring etc. But don’t you realize that the best thing to do is just be in nature? Or just drive to the Huntington Gardens on the weekend, or just travel to Japan instead? In fact when you go on a flight, and you see all these little tiny homes From Birds Eye view, you realize how ridiculous the desire of homeownership is. I think real estate will be the next sector that bitcoin gobbles up. The average GenZ person doesn’t care for buying a house, they want to just play pickle ball, go hiking and camping, go on road trips, buy the newest iPhone etc. Pursue their hobbies and passions. Millennials, we are a funny basket case. We used to be like GenZ, wanting to travel to planet, become a digital nomad, etc.… But somewhere along the line, maybe because of Covid, we tried to settle down and buy single-family homes instead? Or condos? I’m starting to feel like this is the early the Internet, AOL, AOL 3.0, you got mail, dial up 56K modems etc. I also like bitcoin because it is just easier to mentally and mathematically remember things. Easier to remember how many bitcoins you have on the top of your head, rather than trying to tabulate all the ones and zeros of all your fake fiat based assets? Rather than thinking about your net worth, easier to just remember your net bitcoins; ￼ Whenever I find out that somebody else is into bitcoin, I have zero issues asking them how many bitcoins they own. Why? Because it is still a relatively new field, it is awkward to ask people how much US dollars they have in their savings account, or checking account, Easier to just ask the bitcoin question. And for me, even owning a single bitcoin is like for me, owning like a square block of digital Manhattan or Kyoto. You know these rich families that own huge plots of land in desirable locations? Yeah, that’s like bitcoin. A single-family home in Beverly Hills is what like at least 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million? 100,000,000? My personal projection is if you tag the price of a bitcoin to desirable real estate in the Brentwood Hills or something, just think about what the land is worth for the Getty museum. Or like owning a piece of land or property next to the PCH in Malibu. But actually if you think about it, the value of a single bitcoin is worth 1 trillion times more than even the best property in Malibu. Why? The dangers of owning physical property, landslides, Robberies, general maintenance. The fear that your housekeeper is stealing your stuff. For example, how comfortable are you leaving your $200,000 Rolex just sitting around? Probably not very comfortable. Bitcoin is the new family jewels. Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: AI boom drives shares of sleepy Texas land firm up 200%

Full Content:
The newest addition to the S&P 500 may be a relic of the Wild West, but its skyrocketing valuation is a byproduct of the AI boom. Founded in 1888, the Texas Pacific Land Corporation is a company that has just 100 employees but a market capitalization of more than $35 billion. For comparison, American Airlines, based in nearby Fort Worth, employs over 100,000 people and is worth roughly $10 billion. Texas Pacific Land Corporation, or TPL, began as a land trust but found itself sitting on “black gold” soon after oil was discovered in West Texas during the early 1900s. Recently, the company has begun exploring other ways to make money from its 873,000 acres, an area larger than Yosemite National Park. Betting that the region’s dirt-cheap natural gas will be a draw for America’s tech giants, TPL is luring renewable power projects, Bitcoin mines, and utility-scale battery production. Then there’s the possibility of data centers, which has helped TPL nearly triple its stock price in the past year. It remains to be seen whether the centers will become a fixture of the Permian Basin like oil pumps, but there’s no shortage of investor hype for companies that could capitalize on the energy boom needed to power the AI revolution. “TPL just has a lot of positive attributes for data centers, and nobody has more land than us in West Texas,” CEO Tyler Glover said on the company’s earnings call earlier this month. The company declined to provide further comment for a Bloomberg report on its data ambitions, but Glover said on the earnings call he believes TPL is well positioned to fill the need for land and water services as artificial intelligence opportunities unfold. “If we need to buy more land to accommodate a data center, then we’ve proven that’s not hard for us to do,” he said. “I think there’s also a lot of other parts of the country that are also attractive for data centers, so we’re working hard to make TPL as attractive as possible.” The bullish sentiment around TPL’s data ambitions is unsurprising given how Big Tech’s capital expenditures train doesn’t appear to be slowing anytime soon. According to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, Google parent company Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook parent Meta may spend more than a combined $200 billion next year amid the AI arms race. That means data center power demand in the U.S. could grow roughly 160% by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs, accounting for nearly a tenth of the country’s energy usage. “That kind of spike in power demand hasn’t been seen in the U.S. since the early years of this century,” the bank’s report said. This has prompted plenty of concerns about carbon emissions, and investors have joined the tech giants in trying to think ahead. With Big Tech beginning to ink deals for nuclear power, the top 10 performers in the S&P 500 this year include providers like Vistra (first), GE Vernova (fourth), and Constellation Energy (ninth), per Slickcharts. Demand for natural gas, often dubbed the world’s “cleanest fossil fuel,” also seems set to surge. It’s cheapest in West Texas, where a supply glut has caused prices to turn negative at the Waha Hub near the Permian Basin dozens of times this year. Managing overproduction is not an issue for TPL, which collected almost $100 million in oil and gas royalties last quarter from the likes of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips while not paying anything to operate the actual wells. It’s no wonder investors have also flocked to fellow West Texas landowner Landbridge, which has seen its shares surge more than threefold since going public in June. Landbridge’s footprint in the Permian Basin is less than a third of TPL’s, however. The latter’s stock jumped 14% on Friday after the announcement that TPL would replace Marathon Oil, which has been acquired by ConocoPhillips, in the S&P 500. (TPL’s shares have shed much of that gain early this week, with the stock falling over 10% to trade around the $1,550 mark.) On a broader level, TPL’s newfound data ambitions punctuate the company’s remarkable evolution from a land-sale vehicle created to repay bondholders following the bankruptcy of Texas and Pacific Railway Co., which unsuccessfully tried to connect East Texas and San Diego. In time, the company would trade on the New York Stock Exchange in 1927 and, thanks to its lean operations and stock repurchases, would become a favorite of a young Warren Buffett. Today, unlike the value-first thesis of the Oracle of Omaha, many of TPL’s shareholders are seeking massive growth. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: How ‘Shogun’ Helped FX Find Its Footing as a Streaming Empire
URL: https://variety.com/2024/tv/features/how-shogun-helped-fx-networks-emmys-disney-1236223215/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Six days before the debut of “Shōgun” last February, John Landgraf was worried about the “Endless Scroll.” Sitting with his feet propped up on a low table in his office on the Fox lot in Los Angeles, the longtime head of FX explained what he meant with his signature soft-spoken, brainy intensity. The “endless scroll” is not a talisman from “Shōgun” or an artifact of the Middle Ages but rather a symptom of our times. It refers to the never-ending stream of content that so many of us now have at our fingertips. When asked if he was worried viewers wouldn’t turn out for the most expensive production in the 30-year history of FX, Landgraf paused to think. Any butterflies he had about the show’s launch, he said finally, were wrapped up in his larger concern about the “endless scroll” effect that may be training us to have shorter and shorter attention spans. “You get 10, 15, maybe 25 seconds of somebody’s attention before they make a decision whether this is for them or not for them,” Landgraf said. “That’s the thing that I worry about most.” Related Stories VIP+ Live Nation May Need a New Strategy, Even After Its Big Summer Season South Korea's Oscar Entry '12.12: The Day' Director Kim Sung Soo on Military Coup Drama Following that thread, Landgraf fretted about the prospect that humans will gradually lose interest in the stuff that is his absolute jam: dense, novelistic, narrative storytelling as delivered via movies and TV series — like a lavish sword-and-kimono costume drama set among warring factions in 16th-century Japan. “The technologies enabled by computers and the internet are orders of magnitude bigger than almost any disruption we’ve ever seen, because they’re not just economic — they’re cognitive. They’re cultural,” Landgraf said. “They’re fundamentally transforming the way we live and the way we think and the way we learn.” This response is far removed from the typical hype and bombast that is the natural language of Hollywood executives. But Landgraf, 62, is far removed from a typical executive. “The culture that John has created at FX is very special,” says Justin Marks, who is showrunner and executive producer of “Shōgun” alongside his wife, Rachel Kondo. “You never feel like you’re working with people who are afraid of losing their jobs over one bad decision, which is incredibly rare these days.” At a time when traditional cable channels are trying to avoid extinction, Landgraf and the organization he has steered for 20 years is enjoying a resurgence that has been five years in the making. Led by the critical and commercial success of “Shōgun,” FX packed a wallop this year with a busy slate of originals including “The Bear,” “What We Do in the Shadows,” “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” “Reservation Dogs” and the latest iterations of “American Horror Story,” “Fargo” and “Feud.” Moreover, FX’s rebound started just when its parent company, Disney, needed some good news. “Shōgun” not only paid off on Disney’s considerable investment — estimated to be around $200 million for the production of Season 1 alone — but the show’s impact in the U.S. and key overseas territories helped quiet CEO Bob Iger’s critics as Disney’s stock price slumped. FX’s banner year was the proof Iger needed to counter the argument that he’d overpaid when he bought 21st Century Fox — which included the FX cable channel — for $71 billion in 2019. “Year after year, they’ve demonstrated that they not only have a keen eye for great creativity, but they have guts,” Iger says of Landgraf and his team. “You have to be fearless and willing to take big risks.” Iger had to back up his words of praise for the FX operation with Disney dollars shortly after the Disney-Fox deal closed in March 2019. “Shōgun” had been percolating in development at FX for years. Landgraf and FX Entertainment presidents Gina Balian and Nick Grad felt the project was finally ready and that FX could make a statement with a big, ambitious production. “A guy comes into your office and says, ‘I’d like to make a limited series set hundreds of years ago, and it will be virtually all in Japanese with a Japanese cast,’” Iger recalls with a chuckle. “How do you make that bet? You end up making that bet because you bet on John and his team.” RELATED CONTENT: ‘Shōgun’ — How a Decade of False Starts, Endless Debates and a Star-Turned-Producer Made a Classic Story Relevant Again “Shōgun” was the very first project that Balian commissioned for development after joining FX from HBO in 2012. Fortuitously, the series hit the airwaves right around the time that Iger was being publicly targeted in an activist investor campaign waged by Trian Partners’ Nelson Peltz — for the second time in two years. That was not a good look for Disney, a pillar of corporate America. If “Shōgun” had fizzled, it would have put even more pressure on Disney. “It was equal parts relief and exhilaration that it worked, because we’d bet the farm on it,” Landgraf says. The creative achievement of “Shōgun” was recognized with 18 Emmy Awards in September, which propelled FX past HBO and Netflix to lead the industry in total Emmy wins for the first time. It was a crowning moment for Landgraf and his tight-knit team. “What makes FX is John’s taste, his intelligence, his profound love for artists and creators, his storytelling sense and his almost encyclopedic knowledge of TV and film,” says Dana Walden, Disney Entertainment co-chairman who oversees FX and the rest of Disney’s TV operations (other than ESPN) including global streaming. “And onto that foundation you layer in a number of excellent executives who have been together for a very long time. That’s unique in the industry right now.” Walden has been a close colleague of Landgraf ’s for 25 years. Beyond award-season bragging rights, the success of “Shogun” helped reinforce FX’s role as a content engine driving Disney’s adult streaming strategy for Hulu and Disney+. “We proved to ourselves that we can do it,” Balian says. “With all the marketing and the publicity planning and a real worldwide launch – our teams figured out how to navigate this huge system that has so much to offer in terms of support. We learned a lot about how to market and launch a show like that.” And somehow, it seems fitting that it took a series that looks back 500 years in history to help FX find its way forward. “You couldn’t make ‘Shōgun’ for anything other than a global streaming platform. You need a global audience to amortize the cost,” Landgraf says. “We proved that Disney should be making this kind of programming. But we didn’t do it without them. We made it with them, and we distributed it with them. And it worked.” For Team FX, the path to figuring out how it would settle into the Disney universe was complicated by the internal drama that seized the media giant during Bob Chapek’s short tenure as CEO from 2020 through November 2022. (Iger had stepped down as CEO in February 2020.) The post-merger integration process that began under Iger in 2019 had already been humbling for FX. The company had been accustomed to having a lot of autonomy under the Fox regime. “We went from being an actual business that we managed to essentially a cost center inside Disney’s larger organization,” Landgraf said. The radical restructuring of Disney’s network and studio operations that Chapek subsequently implemented also created a lot of internal agita and speed bumps. Iger restructured the restructuring the moment he returned to power in November of 2022. The Chapek plan “was done in good faith, but it was very challenging because it functionally separated business and creative,” Landgraf observes. “Decoupling those two things sort of pitted those disciplines a little bit against each other more than creating a cooperative environment. The reconstitution of Disney Entertainment brought us all back together again.” Amid all of the shuffling, the elevation of Dana Walden in 2022 to be the top executive running all TV might have been a catalyst for a leader of Landgraf’s stature to seek a job somewhere else. He’s been courted by many companies many times — and by his own account he’s never engaged because he’s never had a more tempting offer. He routinely expresses his gratitude for Iger’s leadership as well as for Walden and Peter Rice, the Fox veteran who held the top TV job immediately after the Disney deal but was pushed out in 2022 by Chapek. “If Dana, Peter and I hadn’t come over together, I don’t think we would have made it through all that. Obviously, at a certain point, Peter didn’t make it through. I don’t think I’d still be here without Dana,” Landgraf says. “None of this would exist without Bob [Iger]. I don’t think I’d be here without Bob – term one and term two.” Walden notes that she and Landgraf first worked closely together even before he joined FX, during the 1999-2004 period when Landgraf ran Danny DeVito’s Jersey Television banner. Jersey Television had a studio production pact with 20th Century Fox Television as Walden was climbing the ranks at that studio. “There’s an enormous amount of trust between the two of us. We’ve been there for each other for a very long time,” Walden says. “From the moment I got this job, John said, ‘I’m thrilled.’ These jobs can get a little lonely at the top. I think he feels a little less lonely in his role because he has me as a partner.” From Landgraf and Walden on down, the well established working relationships among the core executive team is a big advantage for the company, industry insiders say. Balian considers herself a newbie at the company, and she’s heading into her 13th year as a senior production and programming executive. Grad is at 22 years and counting. Marketing chief Stephanie Gibbons passed her 20-year milestone earlier this year. Communications chief John Solberg is approaching 25 years. Eric Schrier spent 22 years as a key architect of FX before moving two years ago to a senior role under Walden as president of Disney Television Studios and business operations. Continuity of management breeds strong company culture, and the culture at FX is as strong as the chrome on the motorcycles seen in “Sons of Anarchy.” “There’s just a scrappiness to the place,” says Balian during a sit-down interview with Grad and Landgraf in late October. FX signed on the air in 1994 amid a boom cycle for cable channel launches. Thanks to its humble beginnings as a ragtag cousin of the Fox broadcast network, FX had a steeper climb to becoming a contender in prestige TV contests than HBO after “The Sopranos” hit the creative communities on both coasts like a meteor. “You never counted on being given anything. You always felt you had to work for it, right?” Balian asks Grad and Landgraf. They nod. “I go back to the same analysis I’ve been doing for 22 years,” Grad says, “which is, make really original, cool shit, and the rest will sort itself out.” Iger made a visit to FX’s office on the West L.A. Fox lot days after the Disney-Fox acquisition agreement was reached in December 2017. He was already a fan of the work the company did, but he didn’t know Landgraf or anyone else there, with the exception of Grad. (Grad’s late father, MTM Television and 20th Century Fox executive Peter Grad, had been Iger’s business associate in the 1980s and ’90s.) “I walked in and said, ‘Tell me about yourselves,’” Iger recalls. “To a person, they understood the brand’s mission and what they stood for.” Iger assured the nervous staffers that he had no intention of disrupting the FX ecosystem or imposing an overly Disney-fied work environment on them. Iger has learned the importance of preserving an acquired company’s unique culture and characteristics the hard way — by enduring difficult post-merger transitions. “The culture of a company is extremely valuable and part of the value proposition in a deal,” Iger says. “You don’t create a Pixar unless you have a great culture, unless you have people who don’t stop trying to make something the best it can be. People who don’t accept mediocrity.” FX’s strength flies in the face of trends that are reshaping the industry. Americans are bailing out of linear cable TV subscriptions in favor of less expensive streamers, a steady decline that spells doom for even the most established cable channels. FX still has tentpole franchises that draw viewers to the linear channel. That’s allowed it to experiment with slightly different programming strategies for the cable channel and the FX branded show portfolio that’s showcased on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ in major territories outside the U.S. Walden points to the FX drama “Snowfall” as an example. During the show’s six-season run, the average age of viewers who tuned in was in the 60s. On Hulu, the average age was in the mid-30s. That’s clear evidence that making the show available on different platforms means that it reaches different viewers. Almost all of FX’s series eventually wind up airing on both linear and streaming. “We view it more as a windowing strategy versus an either/or,” Walden says. FX leaders also still eagerly embrace the concept of producing a pilot episode before making a series greenlight decision. That seems antiquated by comparison to the number of outlets that make the yea-or-nay call after reading a few sample scripts. (HBO is a notable exception.) Grad cites the FX comedy series “Atlanta” as an example of how starting out with only a pilot helped a series become what it was meant to be. As Donald Glover was crafting the show a decade ago, the star insisted that its first installment be directed by Hiro Murai, his collaborator on music videos released by Glover’s hip-hop alter ego, Childish Gambino. It was easier for FX execs to gamble on an untested TV director when the network was only paying for a pilot than to commit full-throttle to an eight- or 10-episode TV series. Pilots used to be the norm for all TV networks and studios, but that has also changed amid the rise of streaming. “If we weren’t making pilots, I don’t know if we’d make that decision on Hiro, who turned out to be one of the most talented narrative directors in the entire industry,” Grad observes. “Cutting our risk into small [financial] milestones along the way definitely allows us to be much ballsier with our choices.” Like other traditional outlets, FX has struggled to adapt to new norms for TV series production and the resulting impact on how creative talent is compensated. FX has some flexibility in dealmaking when it also serves as the studio, as it did on “Shōgun.” But the larger industry shift toward subscription business models and away from after-market sales of movies and TV shows has changed the stakes for creatives. It’s a factor behind the anger that fueled last year’s writers and actors strikes. And it’s by no means settled, the FX trio acknowledge. “Psychologically, I like to live in a world where there’s home runs,” Grad says. “I think people like to know that even if the odds are stacked against them, there’s always the chance they could make life-changing money. And the fact that’s kind of off the table now is less our problem than it is a collective industry problem.” Most of all, FX leaders pride themselves on working hand in hand with writers, producers and other creatives to find the essence of what the artist is trying to say with their work. FX doesn’t have the budget to write big checks to land starry packages. What it can offer creatives is a white-glove approach to honing the material, in an environment where the platform is handling 15 to 20 shows a year, not 150 to 200. It’s a strong selling point for a certain breed of writer, director, producer and star. “We’re like relentless editors, but we’re not relentless editors who are trying to impose our own taste or our own aesthetic on something. We’re relentless editors who say, ‘OK, let us descend into the world that you’re in. Let us help you do the thing you want to do,” Landgraf explains. “We think about what are the best possible questions we can pose to you to challenge you, to make sure that you have thought [the story] through. We want to help artists make the very, very best version of the show that they can possibly make.” Kondo, creator and executive producer of “Shōgun,” confirms that a note-taking session at FX is like none other, thanks to the skills leadership trio as well as key executives such as exec VP Kate Lambert and VP Lindsay Donohue. But it starts at the top. “It’s amazing how deeply [Landgraf] listens to you and the degree of thought that goes into everything he says. He brings in philosophy, history, literature, the Bible – you name it, he brings it all to the table,” Kondo says. “I come to every meeting with my notebook cleared. I know I’m going to get something incredibly valuable, not only to what we’re working on but, like, for my life in general and how I think about my writing.” John Landgraf knows something about human behavior. He was an anthropology major at Pitzer College. He’s been a television programming executive for most of his adult life. He’s studied the intersection of social movements and artistic and pop-culture trends. He’s fascinated by how communities are formed and how they splinter at a time when communication tools (aka the new iPhone in your pocket) are advancing at lightning speed. One indisputable result of the quickening pace of innovation is the increasing amount of global economic activity that revolves around engaging consumers in some form of media — whether a TV show or a TikTok feed or a live virtual concert staged within a Fortnite video game. Will the soft power of media eventually become the most valuable commodity of all? The global economy seems to think so. And that also really worries Landgraf, as the largest of what he calls the “trillion-dollar companies” move deeper into the business he knows best. “There’s something really strange in an economy where there are 500 companies in the S&P and seven of them account for 70% of the growth in the U.S. economy. That’s different,” he says, referring to the group of companies dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by Wall Street: Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla. “I’m not making any value judgment on what they do or what they don’t do. But I can tell you, they’re not long-form storytelling companies,” he says. “And long-form storytelling has been very deeply at the center of American culture and American enterprise and American soft power and a whole lot of other things. And demoting it in the scheme of the communications hierarchy can have profound effects that really worry me.” The Walt Disney Co. is no mom-and-pop operation; as of Nov. 21, its market cap stood at $209 billion. But in the scheme of companies with trillion-dollar balance sheets, Disney could become a takeover target down the road. For now, however, Landgraf is glad that FX found a place in the Magic Kingdom. “Disney made a really bold choice to pivot a century-old company into streaming and the direct-to-consumer business,” he says. “And they decided that they wanted to be as excellent in general entertainment as they are in family entertainment and sports.” FX will take another swing at a big-budget event series with the reimagining of “Alien” with “Fargo” showrunner Noah Hawley. It’s slated to debut in the summer. So the pressure to deliver on a global scale begins anew. Also on the to-do list for next year is moving into new offices on the Disney studio lot in Burbank. That will be the symbolic final step in the Disney merger integration for FX’s nearly 300 staffers, who have continued to work out of leased offices on the Fox lot. There are myriad other challenges ahead. Some of them are utterly unpredictable, like the forward march of AI and technological developments that might further upend the pay-TV ecosystem. Others are as old as the Hollywood Hills. “I’ll give you an analogy,” Landgraf says. “Somebody hands you a giant bucket full of acorns, and only one of them is going to be an oak tree. And they say, ‘Pick the acorn out of this bucket that’s going to be an oak tree.’” He smiles. “You do have the ability to plant it, fertilize it, water it. But some acorns just are not going to grow into oak trees, no matter what you do with them, so you’ve got to pick the ones that have the ability to do that.” Balian and Grad take in the oak-tree analogy as Landgraf argues that the real “magic” of the entertainment business is found in the hunt for the right acorn to nurture. That heady assertion hangs in the air for a few seconds, and then each executive heads back to their office to plant some more trees. The Business of Entertainment

Title: The Next Hot Cybersecurity Skill for Your Resume? Empathy
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/security/27087/the-next-hot-cybersecurity-skill-for-your-resume-empathy
Time Published: 2024-11-26T14:00:00Z

As layoffs ravaged the tech industry throughout 2024, two sectors kept hiring: AI and cybersecurity. Generative AI isn't a surprise; it's the hot new thing, after all. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, contains many subcategories that require either technical know-how or a historical understanding of computing and crime. I recently spoke with someone who's done a lot of cybersecurity hiring in recent years, Maarten Van Horenbeeck, the chief security officer at Adobe. He told me that creating empathy through skill diversity is his goal when hiring for Adobe's cybersecurity teams. We also talked about how his teams find and train new hires from not-so-technical backgrounds to provide a much-needed balance between the business and technical sides of the company. Cybersecurity subcategories such as cloud security, digital forensics, identity management, incident response, and network security may sound similar, but they all require different kinds of expertise. In recent years, experts have told me that it's hard to hire a person with 10 years of experience in the nebulous field that is cybersecurity. It's the reason why there's an oft-discussed cybersecurity talent gap that's leaving key roles unfilled at major companies. Van Horenbeeck said that many people want to get into cybersecurity, but they usually don’t get many chances to develop expertise while working their day jobs in unrelated fields like developers or corporate communications. He suggested that one way managers can find new hires is to consider applicants with diverse skill sets who can apply their past experiences to current security issues. Van Horenbeeck used his career path as an example. When he began working as a security consultant in the early 2000s, he dabbled in a bit of everything. From cryptography to forensics to incident response and even penetration testing, it all gave him a wide scope of the cybercrime landscape and how it fits into a wider corporate ecosystem. Today’s highly technical, hyperspecialized cybersecurity community lends itself to experts focusing on just one niche, which makes it harder to hire people with a broad understanding of a company’s security needs. “That's an area where I think companies like us have a responsibility to identify candidates that have potential even if they don't have that very broad expertise in the security domain," he said. “Give them opportunities to grow to find the area that they really feel best about and allow them to grow in that specific domain.” Building teams with people who only have security backgrounds has its drawbacks. “They don't always understand how a software developer works from beginning to end, and that lack of empathy can make things harder,” said Van Horenbeeck. Instead, his company hires developers or people with similar skills who are interested in cybersecurity. They then train them for a specific security niche. This practice is designed to create teams with empathy at the core of their cybersecurity strategies. Adobe’s CyberPeace Builders program also seeks to develop empathetic cybersecurity teams by working with nonprofit organizations. The program provides volunteer security support for nonprofits in need. “For me, empathy is the number one skill that we need in individuals that enter the field,” said Van Horenbeeck. “By having our engineers work with organizations that are so different from technology companies, I think they really get to learn about how their advice is taken in real life.” People who have worked in other careers or at other jobs will bring new perspectives to the team, helping the group solve problems that go beyond IT or software development. It’s wise in any career to have empathy and patience for people who do not have your expertise or skillset. Not every organization has Adobe’s resources. Still, if you manage a cybersecurity team, it may be possible to create your own experts with a commitment to in-house education. It starts with facilitating company-wide conversations about cybersecurity. “As a CSO, I am most successful when there are many different conversations ongoing in the company related to security,” said Van Hoorenbeck. At Adobe, the cybersecurity team offers opportunities for employees to collaborate with people from other teams through presentations, brown bag information sessions, and soliciting performance feedback from other employee groups. If your company is only looking for new employees on job boards or at job fairs, you’re missing out. Van Horenbeeck said it’s especially important to identify talented entry-level employees who are interested in cybersecurity. That means going to where those people are talking: Cyber conferences, mailing lists, or online communities like BlackGirlsHack. Another option is sponsoring internships with higher education institutions. “We look with these universities for people that may be a really good fit to join Adobe as an intern and then ideally migrate into full-time roles within the company," explained Van Horenbeeck. Adobe partnered with Bowie State University for an internship program in 2023, and other major tech companies, such as Amazon and Microsoft, have similar partnerships with schools around the United States. The best way to find talented cybersecurity employees or to become a security professional is to relax your expertise expectations and approach the career with empathy at the forefront. “Don't purely focus on cyber security,” Van Horenbeeck advised. “I would say look at technology as a wide field, and look at security as a specialization in it. That creates opportunities for you to move into those types of roles.” I review privacy tools like hardware security keys, password managers, private messaging apps and ad-blocking software. I also report on online scams and offer advice to families and individuals about staying safe on the internet. Before joining PCMag, I wrote about tech and video games for CNN, Fanbyte, Mashable, The New York Times, and TechRadar. I also worked at CNN International, where I did field producing and reporting on sports that are popular with worldwide audiences. PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Title: Wall Street’s Uber Bull Tom Lee Makes Next Bold Bet in ETF Era

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) — Wall Street prognosticators tend to huddle around the consensus, afraid to stand out for fear of being wrong. Then there’s Tom Lee. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The chief investment officer at Fundstrat Capital has made his name with bold calls (the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at 15,000; Bitcoin (BTC-USD) to $10 million). His unabashedly bullish takes, for which he makes no apologies, have drawn legions of online followers in this anything-goes era of market speculation — fueled by do-it-yourself retail investors. Now, the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist is looking to cash in on his renown with a new exchange-traded fund, the Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (ticker GRNY), which launched earlier this month and has already raked in more than $400 million. It’s the first of what he hopes will be many to follow. The fund’s name, like the list of equity recommendations Lee has provided clients since 2019, is derived from an unconventional basketball free-throw style he likens to his systematic, theme-based stock-picking process. It may not look the coolest, Lee says, but it has the highest chance of success. “Our clients and their loyalty and the fact that we’re still growing really rapidly as a research firm is not just because we’re bulls,” Lee said in an interview, adding the firm has a dedicated institutional following as well. “It’s because we’ve given them many reasons to understand why markets should do what they’re doing.” The ETF is off to a strong start. GRNY is up 2.2% since its early November launch, compared to a 0.2% advance for the S&P 500 over the same span. Its $412 million of inflows puts it in the top 10% of fund debuts this year based on speed of asset accumulation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Still, GRNY is launching amid a difficult run for stock pickers. Roughly two-thirds of large cap managers have underperformed the S&P 500 this year through the end of October, data from Strategas Research show. In fact, more than half of active managers have trailed the benchmark in 14 of the last 15 years. Thematic ETFs have also fallen out of favor recently, with outflows in nine out of 10 months this year through October, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. For more, subscribe to the ETF IQ weekly newsletter That won’t deter Lee. GRNY is based on four longer-term themes, including easing financial conditions and global labor suppliers, and three shorter-term ones like seasonality and style tilt. Stocks that aligned with two or more of the themes are included in the fund. Meta Platforms Inc. falls into five themes, for example, while Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Garmin Ltd. fit into four. “It’s not a black box process,” said Lee, who added that he and his team have received positive feedback for their transparency. “Granny Shots is giving people a really good understanding of why they’re owning this.” Top holdings include police and military equipment producer Axon Enterprise Inc., Tesla Inc. and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. The fund, which consists of some 35 stocks, will be rebalanced quarterly. The themes, too, are dynamic. Being perennially bullish doesn’t always pay off, of course. Both 2018 and 2022 were difficult years for risk assets and, in turn, Lee’s optimistic outlook. Yet last year his S&P 500 forecast was the most accurate among more than 20 Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg as the gauge advanced 24%. This year is likely to be a similar story as the benchmark’s 26% advance has exceeded even the most bullish estimates. He recently told Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast that the S&P 500 could hit 15,000 by 2030. When it comes to Bitcoin, he’s been predicting the digital token would hit $100,000 since at least 2018. In February, he forecast the virtual currency would reach $150,000 by year-end, mainly because of a supply-demand imbalance due to a planned reduction in the rewards miners receive, and incoming president Donald Trump’s pledge to set up a national Bitcoin stockpile. Lee, who co-manages the fund with Ken Xuan, is the latest in a growing list of prominent economists and investors to launch ETFs, joining the likes of Nouriel Roubini, Research Affiliates’ Rob Arnott and others. Still, it takes more than just a recognizable name to launch a successful fund, he said. “I don’t think just because someone has a name that suddenly they can put out an ETF and it attracts assets,” Lee said. Ultimately, the plan is for GRNY to be the first of numerous ETFs based on Lee’s investment philosophy. “We’re already planning a full phase of what follows this one,” he said. —With assistance from Lu Wang.

Title: How the Trump tariffs on Taiwan chips could hurt the AI trade — and the likes of Nvidia

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/26/2024 4:05:54 AM PST by RoosterRedux President-elect Donald Trump made raising tariffs on imported goods a tenet of his reelection campaign. And while that could raise prices on everything from jeans to children’s toys for everyday Americans, Trump has also floated the idea of another tariff that could impact Wall Street’s current favorite trade: AI. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election, Trump lambasted the idea of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation Biden signed in 2022 designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. He called it “so bad.” Instead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” (Excerpt) Read more at finance.yahoo.com ...

Providing defense for Taiwan costs money. If the US military wasn’t funded, the PRC flag would be flying over where the silicon foundries are. Hitting the Russian bear in Ukraine to deter the PRC from invading Taiwan is expensive. Many of the chips never make it to the USA, they go to the EU, Japan, elsewhere in Taiwan, Canada, etc. 7 posted on 11/26/2024 4:30:31 AM PST by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: RoosterRedux Joe Biden launched a program to build chips in the USA years ago and spent billions of US taxpayer money. We wouldn’t want to undermine his legacy. Having chip companies repay in tariffs the money Joe spent to build chip plants seems fair. 8 posted on 11/26/2024 4:35:04 AM PST by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: dennisw Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is in the process of building three advanced semiconductor fabrication plants in Arizona, with the first expected to come online in 2025. I believe that if Trump takes office again, he will likely encourage TSMC to expedite the construction of additional facilities, although this is complicated by the current shortage of a highly trained labor force in the U.S. Additionally, I anticipate that Trump will collaborate with Nvidia and other chip manufacturers to facilitate a smooth transition to U.S.-based production. Regarding the potential for a Chinese attack on Taiwan, such an event would severely cripple or even destroy TSMC’s operations. This would have a cascading effect on China's economy, which is heavily reliant on chips sourced from TSMC. Consequently, it would significantly hinder China's ambitions to develop its own semiconductor industry. 9 posted on 11/26/2024 4:36:27 AM PST by RoosterRedux (Emerson (paraphrased): "If you strike at the king, don't fail."

He called it “so bad.” Instead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” (Excerpt) Read more at finance.yahoo.com ...

Title: Educating a New Generation of Workers

Full Content:
There is a crisis in technical education. The golden road to a career has always been through a college education. However, this âgolden roadâ has developed deep cracks and is badly in need of maintenance. Postsecondary education is rapidly becoming unaffordable, even at public colleges and universities. Tuition has risen at a rate 50% greater than inflation. But thereâs a deeper issue. Beyond the out-of-control cost, there is evidence that degrees do not map to the skills needed in today’s job market, and thereâs an increasing disconnectâparticularly in computer scienceâbetween the skills employers want and the skills colleges teach. Employers are struggling with a related problem: keeping the people who are already on their staff up-to-date with the skills they need. Itâs common for experts who spend their waking hours working at the cutting edge of the technology industry to feel like theyâre falling behind. The trend has only increased in the era of generative AI. A graduate degree is an option for employees who can afford it, but it doesnât help employers. After spending a year getting a masterâs degree, an employee is unlikely to return to the same employer, let alone the same job. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. Why, and more important how, are colleges and universities failing? And what can companies that need to hire junior staff and upskill their current staff do about it? Colleges and universities are rarely agile. They donât respond to changes quickly, and that leaves them particularly vulnerable when providing training for industries where change is rapid. The traditional CS major may be where colleges and universities are at their weakest. The pace of change is very rapid, particularly when compared to the career of tenured faculty, and the resistance to change can be especially strong when change is rapid. CS departments have adapted well to AI, partly because AI originated in academia. But many jobs require skills that frequently arenât taught in traditional CS departments, such as cloud development, Kubernetes, and microservices. Why arenât these institutions able to adapt to changes in technology? Professors spend much of their time doing researchâwell, in reality, they spend most of their time serving on committees. Thereâs little time left over to find out what industry is doing, let alone develop courses to teach it. Staying current in the tech industry is a bit like being a professional athlete: You have to train daily to maintain your physical conditioning. Entirely new paradigms rise quickly: cloud computing, data engineering, machine learning engineering, mobile development, and large language models. To further complicate things, topics like cloud computing, software operations, and even AI donât fit nicely within a university IT department. They require going outside to commercial cloud vendors, which requires expense accounts and budget commitments that arenât covered by research grants. No university has the computing resources comparable to Google, or even to a well-funded startup. Nor do they have experience building and operating highly distributed systems. Topics like microservices and cloud native computing present an additional problem: salary commitments. Can an administrator justify the salary of a senior faculty member who specializes in a topic that might be forgotten five or ten years in the future, even if thatâs what industry wants right now? Can the administration commit to paying a tenured faculty salary for 30 or so years if that professorâs specialty may be irrelevant long before they retire? Itâs less risky to hire adjunct professors with industry experience to fill teaching roles that have a vocational focus: mobile development, data engineering, and cloud computing. Using adjuncts to teach the skills that industry wants creates its own problem: an underclass within the university teaching staff. Itâs no wonder that I have heard professors say âCloud computing is a fad and not worth teaching.â Itâs no wonder that many faculty members see these topics as âvocational educationâ while theyâre trying to teach long-term verities: these âvocationalâ topics fulfill the needs of industry rather than the research community and are taught by faculty with short-term contracts who come and go each year. Itâs understandable that professors are reluctant to teach a subject that is based almost entirely on proprietary technology that can change with minimal notice. However, if thatâs the kind of expertise companies want, students who need that training will find it elsewhereâand if universities canât provide the training students need, they will lurch toward irrelevance. In a recent Wall Street Journal article, âWhy Americans Have Lost Faith in the Value of College,â Douglas Belkin highlights another issue: critical thinking. As Belkin explains, The misalignment between universities and the labor market is compounded by the failure of many schools to teach students to think critically. Professors compete for tenure on the basis of the quality of their research and publishing track record. Teaching is mostly an afterthought. Professors who earn tenure negotiate lighter teaching loads. To fill the gap, schools hire less expensive adjuncts with little job security. These precariously employed adjuncts depend on strong student performance reviews for job security, a system that incentivizes them to make few demands in exchange for high ratings. Any metric can be gamed (often called Goodhartâs law)âand grades are no exception, gamed both by faculty who need good ratings from students and by students who want good grades from faculty. Grades are part of the critical thinking problem, as is a dismissal of writing, reading, and non-STEM skills. Itâs not as if critical thinking isnât taught in universities. The humanities are nothing without critical thinking, whether or not theyâre taught by overwhelmed and underpaid adjunctsâbut humanities departments are the ones most threatened by budget cuts and, at some schools, outright elimination. Vocational skills are a necessity, whether or not CS departments want to teach them. Assessment is a necessity, and itâs something corporations take very seriously, at least for in-house training programs. But making vocational skills and assessment priorities risks letting grades become a motivating factor, and that is counterproductive. Is anything more conformist than aspiring to do what your teacher says to get an A? Or to build your academic career around getting a job at a prestigious, high-profile company? Students need to learn how to make mistakes. They need to learn how to push their ideas as far as they can and then a little farther. In my classes I encourage students to fail early and often. A failure is a desired outcome: It means they tried something hard and unique or that they learned a big lesson. Teaching students to consider problems from many perspectives, including those that are uncomfortable, is a necessity. Too many students graduate thinking that science is a set of facts rather than understanding that itâs a process of skeptical inquiry driven by experiment. Too many students think that engineering is about getting the answer in the back of the book, not about making the trade-offs that are necessary in the real world. And too many companies fail because they canât question their own assumptions. This is all critical thinkingâand anything less shortchanges both students and the companies that eventually hire them. Soâcolleges and universities are failing industry. They arenât providing graduates who are trained in the skills companies need; they arenât nurturing critical thinkers; and they are pricing themselves out of the range of all but the ultrawealthy. What can companies do to acquire and retain the talent they need? Understanding industry needs isnât a static project. In 2020, the World Economic Forum estimated that automation will displace 85 million jobs by 2025 but will also create 97 million new jobs. Another publication estimated that there were 13 million unfilled technology jobs. In the 21st century, churn is ever present. Whatever your job is now, it will be different in five to ten years: Your skills will be obsolete, and youâll need to learn new ones. Thatâs a problem for both new graduates and experienced staff, to say nothing of the companies that employ them. And as weâve seen, itâs an even bigger problem for colleges and universities. To start, weâll look at what companies actually need, using data from OâReillyâs learning platform. There are two factors: course enrollments, which show what students are studying, and course completion, which may reveal skills in high demand. The median course completion percentage on the OâReilly platform is similar for B2B users and B2C users, and roughly matches industry standards. A higher completion rate could indicate that the course teaches an emerging skill that is required in industry. Examples of these skills are artificial intelligence (prompt engineering, GPT, and PyTorch), cloud (Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Microsoftâs Azure AZ-900 certification), Rust, and MLOps. Itâs important to note that CISSP (the Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certification is on the list; although security skills are hardly a new requirement, corporate attitudes toward security have changed drastically in the past few years. Executives donât like seeing their companies in the news for a security breach. Some other topics with high completion rates are ggplot (for data-driven graphics in R), GitHub, and Selenium (a software testing framework). SolidWorks is an outlier; SolidWorks courses have relatively few users, but almost all the users complete them. What are people studying? The previous graph includes all users of the OâReilly learning platform. What can we see if we look at B2B and B2C users separately? Thereâs a high correlation between completion rates for both types of users on the platform. The Pearson correlation is 0.8, meaning B2B and B2C users move together 80% of the time, but there are some important differences: Individual users (B2C) are learning about technologiesâperhaps to help in getting a new job or to acquire skills they need in their current job, perhaps to help with their personal projects. Users who are coming from corporate accounts (B2B) behave differently. Theyâre learning skills that are important in a business environment: communications, teamwork, project management. Also, keep in mind there may be outliers here like SolidWorks, which could be a course an employer requires an employee to complete. Linkedinâs research on mapping skills to jobs led the company to develop a skills genome. Hereâs how itâs described: For any entity (occupation or job, country, sector, etc.), the skills genome is an ordered list (a vector) of the 50 âmost characteristic skillsâ of that entity. These most characteristic skills are identified using the TF-IDF algorithm to identify the most representative skills of the target entity while down-ranking ubiquitous skills that add little information about that specific entity (e.g., Microsoft Word). Essentially, this approach shows that you can rank skills by how often they show up in job postings. Skipping the math, hereâs an intuitive description of TF-IDF: Term Frequency (TF): Measures how frequently a word (or skill, in this case) appears within a document or job posting. A higher frequency might indicate relevance.Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Measures how common or rare a word is across a larger collection of documents (or job postings). Common words like “the” or “and” receive a lower IDF score, de-emphasizing their importance. We can accomplish something similar by doing topic modeling on OâReillyâs data. First, we find the top words associated with each topic. Then we use zero-shot classification to map the topics to jobs. That process yields results like these: Cybersecurity professional:– Matched Topic 1: [‘kubernetes’, ‘ckad’, ‘developer’, ‘application’, ‘certified’] | Score: 0.976– Matched Topic 2: [‘security’, ‘professional’, ‘certified’, ‘systems’, ‘information’] | Score: 0.918 Technology consultant: – Matched Topic 1: [‘kubernetes’, ‘ckad’, ‘developer’, ‘application’, ‘certified’] | Score: 0.579– Matched Topic 2: [‘azure’, ‘microsoft’, ‘az’, ‘fundamentals’, ‘900’] | Score: 0.868– Matched Topic 3: [‘linux’, ‘gpt’, ‘artificial’, ‘intelligence’, ‘go’] | Score: 0.623– Matched Topic 4: [‘learning’, ‘machine’, ‘deep’, ‘design’, ‘driven’] | Score: 0.527 The job âcybersecurity professionalâ requires skills in Kubernetes (including CKAD certification), along with security skills. A job as a technology consultant requires a broader group of skills: cloud development, linux, AI, and more. âTechnology consultantâ doesnât match to topics as sharply as does âcybersecurity professional,â but it still gives us a good starting point. After a bit of data cleansing, we can invert this mapping to find out what jobs are associated with any given topic. For example, take the titles of courses, then map them to topics, then take the topics and map them to job titles. For example in Topic 1, the skills âAWSâ and âcloudâ map to the job titles cloud engineer, AWS solutions architect, and technology consultant. This result is exactly what we should expect, showing that this approach to discovering the labels of skills mapping to jobs has merit.Topic 1 (AWS, cloud): Topic 1 (AWS, cloud): Topic 2 (Python, AI design): Topic 3 (Software architecture): Topic 4 (Kubernetes, developers): Topic 5 (Java development): Topic 6 (Microservices): Topic 7 (Security systems): Topic 8 (Microsoft Azure): Topic 9 (Linux, AI): Topic 10 (Deep learning): Topic modeling can play an important role in identifying job skills based on the topics learners consume. This could certainly be used by educational institutions to give them a competitive advantage. It certainly is used by companies like OâReilly, which provide training services to individual and corporate customers. But more importantly, it provides valuable information to HR departments about the skills they need to hire for. For institutions that can make use of this data, it serves as a competitive advantage. It tells them what roles the topics they teach are preparing the students for, and can help them plan curricula that are more relevant to the needs of industry. A university could use this analysis to look at external trends along with internal course popularity. Students may have unique intuitions about what skills they need based on job interviews and internships. Analyzing alumni data could show what job titles their alumni have had, which could be compared with the courses those alumni took while enrolled. What does industry need? The course completion data shows that students from our corporate clients are looking for soft skills like management, communications, and product management in addition to technical skills. While this might reflect studentsâ desires to âget aheadâ rather than corporate needs, companies are aware that good communications and management skills are essential and not taught in degree programs. And, letâs face it, everyone wants product managers. Topic modeling shows that corporations are looking for cloud skills, software architecture (a more senior skill to aspire to), AI skills, Kubernetes, Java, Python, microservices, security, and Linux. Except for AI, Java, and Python, itâs difficult or impossible to find courses on these topics in college or university CS departments. We wonât name names, but we challenge you to do your own research. Most of the schools we looked at offered one or two courses on cloud computing (though nothing on specific cloud vendors); we were unable to find any university that offered courses on microservices or Kubernetes, though no doubt some exist. If you take up our challenge, we suggest that you look at the course offerings in your stateâs flagship university, one of its second-tier universities, a community college, and two private institutions (one prestigious, one not). The less prestigious schools are more likely to provide training in specific job-related skills. If colleges and universities donât provide training on skills that are important to industry, who will? Responsibility would seem to fall squarely on the shoulders of industry. If you canât hire people with the skills you need, hire good people and train them. But is training available on the job? Too often, the answer is no. Why is that? An increasing number of companies are waking up to the need for corporate training programs, but in doing so, theyâre going against the last few decades of corporate thinking. For years, the incentives have been wrong. Stockholders want to see the price of the stock increase and pressure executives to use buybacks and layoffs to maximize their stockâs near-term value, often at the expense of long-term thinking. In The Man Who Broke Capitalism, David Gelles notes, Before [Jack] Welch, corporate profits were largely reinvested in the company or paid out to workers rather than sent back to stock owners. In 1980, American companies spent less than $50 billion on buybacks and dividends. By the time of Welchâs retirement, a much greater share of corporate profits was going to investors and management, with American companies spending $350 billion on buybacks and dividends in 2000. Training is an investment in the companyâand itâs a kind of investment that has gone out of style. However, forward-thinking companies realize that an investment in upskilling their employees is a critical part of long-term strategic thinking. Running a company as lean as possible to maximize short-term profit has dire effects on training: If expenses are cut to the bone, companies canât help their staff keep up with changes in technology, nor can they prepare recent college graduates to make the transition to the âreal world.â In turn, a workforce that lags behind current technologies leads to poor long-term outcomes. A staff that falls behind the curve or never makes it to the curve to begin with will have trouble developing successful products for the future. Shortchanging training only leads to a company that underperforms in the long term. Historical evidence supports the value of skilled apprenticeship. Internships can be small âtiger teamsâ that allow students to focus on specific problems with a mentor. Although we donât hear much about apprenticeships in the 21st century, internships (and even PhD programs) share many aspects of apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are an ideal way to bring recent college graduates up to speed on skills they need. They are less applicable for more senior employees who need to sharpen their skills or learn new ones as the industry evolves. Itâs important to remember what senior employees gain from mentoring junior employees. When done well, mentoring exposes the seniors to new ideas from their students. It requires them to think through everything they already know; talking and explaining solidifies their own knowledge. Many companies provide in-house training programs through products such as the OâReilly learning platform. Products like these can be integrated with the companyâs own learning management system (LMS) to create custom curricula depending on their staffâs needs and track progress through the learning program. This kind of solution works well for both senior and junior employees: A senior developer may only need to get up to speed on a few topics of interest, like AI, while a new hire might need to fill in basic knowledge they didnât get in school. Critical thinking presents different issues. Companies in which everyone is indoctrinated with the marketing literature and the annual report eventually fail; theyâre blindsided by new developments because they canât think outside of their boxes. Critical thinking isnât tied to any specific topic or skill, like microservices, but it can be learned in any context. Recently, our learning platform has begun to introduce options for interactivity, including interactive quizzes, coding sandboxes and labs where you can try out ideas, and challenge exercises that test new skills. All of these learning tools help teach critical thinking. Critical thinking skills can also be developed by reading books, writing about what you learned, and participating in study groups. Another key to critical thinking will be valuing teaching as suchâthe kind of patient teaching or mentoring that doesnât revolve around grades or student evaluations but that understands that all teaching is a process of exploration. To build critical thinking skills, companies need to go beyond providing courseware. They need to build a culture where all ideas are respected, a culture that encourages discussion, exploration, and failure. The need to train, upskill, and reskill job seekers isnât being fulfilled. Universities alone arenât enough to meet the demands of a changing workforce. There are no shortcuts. Learning requires doing; it can be messy, stressful, awkward, and difficult. But without the struggle to learn, there is no future: not for individual job seekers and not for the rest of us who rely on their productivity. For most students, learning is a matter of filling the gap between academic study and pragmatic skills.

Title: For Microsoft, will Trump’s antitrust and environmental views help or harm?
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3610613/for-microsoft-will-trumps-anti-trust-and-environmental-views-help-or-harm.html
Time Published: 2024-11-26T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
I recently wrote about how President-elect Donald J. Trump’s actions on AI might affect Microsoft. This week, I’m focused on what his antitrust regulation and environmental plans — and the biggest wildcard of all, his personal vendettas — could do to the company. Trump believes that the less regulation on big business, the better. So you would expect him to put an end to antitrust suits against the tech industry. But that’s not necessarily the case. There’s no doubt that Lina Khan, the head of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who has aggressively pursued antitrust prosecutions against tech, will be let go after Trump’s election. And many of Trump’s advisers, notably venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, would like to see tech antitrust prosecutions to stop. However, some advisers close to Trump, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, want the administration to take on Big Tech — mainly because they want to stop Meta and other social media companies from policing against misinformation, white supremacism, public-health health deceptions and election lies. Microsoft has largely been spared Khan’s prosecutions, even as the Biden administration has targeted Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Apple. The one recent federal antitrust action against Microsoft by the FTC, for buying the gaming giant Activision, didn’t go well for the feds. A judge let the purchase go through, although the FTC has since appealed the case. That might make you think that Microsoft is in the clear under Trump. But The Washington Post reports the FTC will be investigating Microsoft’s cloud business for anticompetitive practices. In addition, the FTC appeal of the Activision case still stands, so that case could be revived. Trump could demand that whomever he appoints to head the FTC drop those actions. Odds are, he won’t, thanks to his main tech adviser, entrepreneur Elon Musk. His AI startup, xAI, competes directly with Microsoft, and is now valued at $50 billion after investments this spring from Andreesen and others. Musk also recently amended an antitrust suit he filed against OpenAI, adding Microsoft as a defendant. Don’t be surprised if the FTC under Trump not only follows through on Khan’s investigations of Microsoft, but also files an AI suit against the company, thanks to Musk’s influence. Trump believes climate change is a hoax. He’s vowed to tear up environmental regulations and attack green energy. His campaign slogan, “Drill, Baby, Drill,” and his close friendship with the oil industry make clear that he’ll do everything he can to increase reliance on fossil fuels and kill clean sources of electricity. He was also a booster of nuclear power during his first administration, though he wasn’t quite as enthusiastic about it on the campaign trail. Even so, the stock market price of nuclear-power-related companies jumped the day after his election, and most people expect him to be a nuclear backer. What does this have to do with Microsoft? Plenty. Microsoft has vowed to make itself carbon-negative by 2030, and Trump’s attack on green energy will make it more difficult for the company to find clean energy sources. Exacerbating Microsoft’s climate-change challenges is the fact that data centers that power AI require a tremendous amount of electricity. As I’ve noted before, Microsoft might be abandoning its promises to fight climate change because of that. And the company could also pour billions into reviving nuclear energy with a proposed deal to reopen Three Mile Island, the site of the worst nuclear power disaster in US history. Given Trump’s views about climate change and his support for AI, he’ll most likely do everything he can to give Microsoft and other AI companies all the electricity they want no matter the effect on the environment. And he’ll also likely let them go full speed ahead with nuclear power. In fact, Microsoft President Brad Smith recently said he expects Trump to cut environmental regulations to provide Microsoft with all the electricity it wants for its AI data centers. Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies — he worked on AI at issues the Department of Defense during the Trump and Biden presidencies — agrees. On a call hosted by The Information, he said Trump “can invoke emergency powers and waive a lot of environmental regulations to allow people to build new nuclear and other electrical generation capacity in order to power the big data centers that folks want for these advanced AI models.” He added that he expects that to happen “pretty early in the Trump Administration.” The president-elect is driven by vendettas and grievances more than he is by policy. And when it comes to tech, he has plenty of them. In the 2020 election, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife started a foundation “to ensure that everyone can vote and every vote can be counted.” Since then, Trump threatened to investigate him and send him to jail if re-elected, saying, “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time, he will spend the rest of his life in prison.” Zuckerberg got the message, offering accolades, saying after last summer’s assassination attempt, “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life…. On some level as an American, it’s like hard to not get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight, and I think that that’s why a lot of people like the guy.” Then there’s Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. When Trump was president, he frequently took aim at Amazon and Bezos because the Post published articles that angered Trump. He didn’t just criticize and threaten him; Trump also yanked a multi-billion-dollar cloud contract with the Defense Department from Amazon. This time around, Bezos is doing Trump’s bidding. He canceled the Post’s planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris even though the newspaper has endorsed candidates for president for decades. After Trump was elected, Bezos praised him, writing on X, “Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” Those are just two of tech titans who have praised Trump even though he had targeted them. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has so far managed to avoid getting on Trump’s bad side. He hasn’t gone out of his way to praise the president-elect, either, offering Trump only a pro forma congratulation after the election. But with Musk as a Trump adviser, and what will likely be a big focus on AI in the new administration, it’s not clear whether Nadella will be able to stay out of Trump’s crosshairs. What’s also not clear is how Nadella will react if Trump threatens him — and how that might affect Microsoft’s financial future and its sense of itself as a moral company.

Title: Virtual Life Is Making Us Lonely and Unhappy. Can We Break the Cycle?
URL: https://slate.com/business/2024/11/remote-work-life-loneliness-isolation-human-doom-loop-zoom-virtual.html
Time Published: 2024-11-26T10:40:00Z
Full Content:
For a decade, my therapy appointments required a 30-minute train ride to a mid-rise medical office building in suburban Philadelphia, where I reclined on a black leather couch, grabbing the occasional Kleenex. But since 2020, I’ve simply closed my web browser (article drafts, credit card bills, LinkedIn feed), angled a 1080p camera so my therapist can’t see baskets of laundry and my kids’ stuffies, and spilled my guts. I sometimes wish I could still visit my therapist in person and even miss those train rides where I’d take stock of my week, but I have no choice but to log on: My therapist, like so many other professionals, has given up going into the office. Remote therapy has increased by a staggering 2,300 percent since 2020 and now accounts for the majority of sessions. It’s one of a number of in-person activities, such as watching a movie, taking an exercise class, or shopping for groceries, that were replaced during the COVID pandemic by their equivalents at home, in front of a screen. Five years later, the convenience, price, and time savings of remote activities have made them fixtures of postpandemic life. When I left full-time work earlier this year to go freelance, I finally landed that totally flexible schedule with no annoying bosses or co-workers. I didn’t expect that working from home would initially mean a 5-pound weight gain, and that I’d take my kids to school not just to make sure they made it to class—but to chat with other parents. It turns out that the simple obligation of going to a workplace, shop, or school every day brought positive externalities that are vanishing from our lives. There was the health benefit: Pushing a shopping cart at the grocery store or walking to and from the office parking lot meant getting in your steps. Since the pandemic, the number of trips made on foot has fallen by 20 percent. There was the social benefit: Being around others made us happier, but by virtue of spending more time at home, we now have fewer opportunities to socialize. Workplaces provided easy ways to form friendships or at least gab by the water cooler—a particularly important resource in a country where 15 percent of Americans have one close friend, if any. The advent of remote work and life has accelerated a worrisome 21st-century trend: We now spend 90 fewer minutes a week socializing face-to-face than we did in 2003. In a report released last year, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy labeled this an “epidemic of loneliness and isolation.” If Americans in the late 20th century had begun “bowling alone,” the title of Robert Putnam’s 2000 book about social decline, a quarter century later they were barely bowling at all. Given these reductions in social connection and physical activity, it’s no surprise that since the pandemic, Americans are less likely to say they feel active, productive, attractive, or in good health. “A lot of these key metrics that we track have sharply worsened,” Dan Witters, the research director of Gallup’s National Health and Well-Being Index, recently told the Boston Globe. “Americans have just not bounced back post-COVID.” Since 2020, many companies, such as DoorDash and Hulu, have capitalized on people’s tendency to spend more and more time at home. “There’s a real sort of push by these companies to ask: How do you keep people on the platform as long as you can? And how do you keep people going back?” says Steve Downs, a veteran of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who co-founded the health nonprofit Building H. “Having all these products and services that make us less social, make us sleep worse, make us eat worse, we’re not heading in a good direction.” According to Building H’s biannual index of the health influence of consumer-facing companies, the ones that rank highly are those that encourage in-person activities, such as Specialized, which manufactures bicycles, and Culdesac, a real estate company developing car-free communities. Netflix scores even lower than fast-food chains. Throughout the pandemic, the media focused on the idea of the “urban doom loop,” in which remote work would kill downtowns, triggering a downward spiral of reduced services that would cause people to leave cities. What went overlooked has turned out to be the bigger and even more consequential story: the human doom loop, a cycle in which people stop connecting in real life, reducing the quality of in-person activities and the physical realm itself, further discouraging IRL activities, and so on. Nearly five years after the pandemic, it’s not the real estate we need to worry about. It’s us. When a Whole Foods opened in my neighborhood in 2016, it featured a ground-floor café where patrons could look out toward Philly’s famed Benjamin Franklin Parkway through double-height windows. Open an hour earlier than the supermarket, the café featured elaborate pour-overs and an afternoon menu featuring wine and beer in addition to food. Although Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017, it wasn’t until the pandemic that the new owner ripped out this so-called third space. Now the ground floor resembles an Amazon shipping facility: The windows are frosted and lined with refrigerator cases full of groceries bagged for delivery, while patrons queue in a busy gauntlet, cellphones with QR codes at the ready, to pick up and return Amazon packages. It’s an example of a place where the pandemic tipped the balance between the digital and in-person worlds. In the past, the digital world serviced the physical one; now it feels like the other way around. I don’t spend much time lingering at the Whole Foods these days, and how could I? There’s a bidirectional relationship underway here; the growth of online goods and services is both the symptom and cause of a disappointing physical world. Consider the cab: Over the past two decades Uber and Lyft have all but entirely replaced free-flowing taxis in most cities. Taxis were imperfect, but now the option to reserve one without a phone has been nearly eliminated—and with it the option to move through the physical world without digital mediation. We are seeing this “Uber effect” play out in almost every realm. As more people shop online, everyday retailers like hardware stores and pharmacies are disappearing, leaving many consumers with no choice. Urban density once enabled niches, such as theaters showing independent films, bookstores carrying foreign magazines, or music stores keyed into the local sound. But now that online algorithms can match people with their interests, cities are losing that function too, and turning into mere showrooms for online brands. In Philadelphia, our prime Rittenhouse Square shopping area is these days home to digital-native brands, including Brooklinen, Vuori, Alo, Warby Parker, M.M. LaFleur, Framebridge, Interior Define, and LoveSac. These stores play a role similar to Amazon drop spots: They serve the necessary human element of an online purchase and little else. As cheap online entertainment grows ever more abundant, fewer go out to a theater production or to see an exhibit in person, and more cultural institutions cut back or close. Audiences for in-person culture are dying off: Just 10.3 percent of American adults attended a musical last year, and 4.5 percent attended a play—the lowest levels ever. The country has lost 4,800 movie screens since 2020. Angie Schmitt, the author of Right of Way: Race, Class, and the Silent Epidemic of Pedestrian Deaths in America, notes that at the same time people have fewer reasons to walk around and experience their communities, they’ve also been frustrated by the rise of homelessness, drug use, and other kinds of disorder in downtowns and on public transit. “That contributes to a lack of social trust,” she says. “And if people go out and have bad experiences, they don’t want to do it again.” Even as crime rates have plummeted from their pandemic-era highs, crossing the street has gotten much more dangerous: The number of pedestrians killed by cars is 14 percent higher than it was in 2019. The pattern is clear: The more we go online, the less we show up in person. And the less we show up, the less likely our physical realm will offer experiences that can compete. The truth is that we’ve vastly underinvested in our cities for decades, and tech companies have exploited this weakness. No wonder so many people feel safer and more engaged by what’s on a screen. “We have the world’s biggest companies, smartest engineers, most innovative content creators, working overtime to figure out how to keep us on our screens,” observed the New York University sociologist Eric Klinenberg, who wrote a 2018 book about the virtues of libraries, Palaces for the People. “And they’re really good at it. They have the best algorithms. They have the best graphic design. They know how to grab our attention and how to keep it. … In the face of that, it seems to me like our ability to convene people in the real world requires making a much more significant investment in physical places.” Of course, there are numerous neighborhoods in the country that offer an appealing physical realm—nearby schools with lively playgrounds for kids, curated boutiques, restaurants, modern offices, cultural venues, and health care resources. They provide lots of ways to stay physically active and to socialize in person. But neighborhoods characterized by their density of amenities, such as parts of Brooklyn, New York, or Cambridge, Massachusetts, have median home prices that routinely exceed $1 million, putting them out of reach for the vast majority of Americans. Ironically, then, the housing crisis is another thing keeping us at home. Because we’ve failed to build housing in our most amenity-rich neighborhoods and let them become too expensive, people have to live in less desirable neighborhoods without the same strong public and private investment in physical spaces. Farther from everything, residents have even less impetus to go shopping in person, attend a cultural event, or trek into work. If they have the choice, that is. In a cruel twist, the people in the most disinvested neighborhoods are the ones most likely to spend their workweeks at the jobs we once called “essential”—as security guards, health care workers, municipal employees, construction workers, and day laborers. They are the ones who rely on being able to run errands or pick up groceries and shop for necessities on their way to and from work. And as our physical infrastructure increasingly breaks down—with late, crowded buses because high-wage professionals are working remotely and reducing the farebox revenue for transit authorities, with shortened business hours for stores as brick-and-mortar retail becomes less viable, with more dangerous streets—these workers pay the price. There was a moment in 2022 when it hit Courtney Klein that something was not right. She was on a Zoom call while waiting in an Austin parking lot to pick up her daughter from gymnastics class. To keep her son from disrupting the call, she gave him a tablet to use in the back seat. Rather than sit in a car on their screens, she wished there were a casual, social place where her son could enjoy some playtime while she quickly hopped on a call (and maybe drank a latte too). Out of this desire, she created All One Thing, which she describes as “a new town square and a new third space.” For now, All One Thing is creating pop-up programming—community dinners, live music, classes for kids, and co-working for adults—in co-working spaces from Los Angeles to Asheville. Klein thinks moms can solve both the human doom loop and the urban doom loop at the same time: “There’s a billion square feet of empty office space. Moms will reimagine those spaces,” she says. It is one of a number of similar efforts. The surgeon general’s loneliness report has inspired Project Gather, a movement for Americans to cook and eat dinner together. Other initiatives were the subject of Join or Die, a 2023 documentary inspired by Robert Putnam’s work. To address the need for better social infrastructure, some cities are investing heavily in public spaces. New York has created the position of chief public realm officer to transform the streetscape, supervising permanent “streeteries,” pedestrianized plazas, and more family-friendly spaces to encourage residents to socialize, shop, eat, and exercise in person. In Paris, a public-private partnership, SEM Paris Commerces, relocates small businesses to empty storefronts, cultivating commercial strips that are far more interesting for strolling than scrolling. In Philadelphia, there’s talk of turning closed schools into multipurpose community hubs that will offer health clinics, food co-ops, even housing for teachers. Our youngest adults, Gen Z, have glorified staying at home, but that may be starting to change as that demographic enters the prime mating years of their 20s. Dating apps are now hosting in-person events, such as ice cream socials and line dancing. Run clubs have become nearly synonymous with looking for hookups. Members-only clubs have also increased in popularity. Maybe this generation, which has grown up online, has learned the hard way that you can shop, learn, exercise, stream, game, worship, and work on a screen, but you still need to connect in person to find love. Even so, these efforts are small when compared with the scale of investment coming from tech companies. Just one, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, has been willing to lose nearly $60 billion over five years investing in the virtual-reality business. We are rushing into a future of widespread A.I., autonomous vehicles, virtual-reality headsets, and mixed-reality apps. For all the talk of moving past the pandemic, the future actually looks a lot like 2020, when so many of us were stuck inside our houses and glued to our screens. We are at the beginning of a shift from a physical, public, and social world to a more digital and private one, accompanied by the instability that attends all technological revolutions. But it’s not too late to do something about it. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: 5 investing trends for 2025—and 15 stocks to help you bet on them

Picking stocks is about predicting the future. As investors can tell you, being early to spot a trend and betting on a company poised to ride it can translate to a handsome return. Those who bought Amazon in 1998, for example, or Tesla in 2012, or Nvidia in 2020 correctly foresaw the respective explosions of online shopping, EVs, and the AI revolution—and made out like bandits. Of course, this isn’t easy to do. One issue is timing. A thesis about the future of a sector might be correct, but it may still be years away. Betting on the right sector but the wrong horse can also be painful, as investors in bankrupt EV maker Fisker or fallen chip giant Intel can attest. In the past, a relatively safe way to invest in macro trends has been to buy so-called cyclical stocks (think travel or entertainment) when the economy is on an upswing, and defensive ones (think consumer staples) when times are bad. Today, though, broader forces like tech transformation and geopolitical upheaval have made this model less reliable. In recent years, for example, utility stocks—a classic defensive play—have been on a tear, while the dominance of the tech-heavy group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven has been a bigger story than any discrepancy between cyclical and defensive stocks. The investment landscape may grow more unpredictable still as Donald Trump prepares his return to the White House. Nonetheless, Fortune’s finance team put our heads together to come up with stock ideas for the coming year. We began by identifying five trends, and then picking three companies set to ride each of those waves in 2025. In some cases, our picks reflect the ongoing march of technology. Other trends such as geopolitical risk—named by CEOs in a recent Deloitte-Fortune survey as having the biggest potential to create disruption—and health and wellness reflect broader political and social shifts. Finally, markets are unpredictable, so treat the stock picks noted here not as advice, but as a departure point for your own research into which companies might shine in the coming year. —Jeff John Roberts In recent years, the world has become more dangerous as war has broken out in the Middle East and on Europe’s doorstep in Ukraine, while tensions remain high in the Taiwan Strait. According to the think tank Institute for Economics & Peace, there are currently 56 armed conflicts around the globe, the highest number since World War II. Meanwhile, numerous reports show a year-over-year double-digit increase in cyberattacks, as bandits and national armies seek to steal data and wreak havoc. These trends are worrisome but also present an opportunity for investors. The conflicts around the globe have produced a shortage of weapons, particularly missiles and missile defense, making companies that cater to militaries a good bet for 2025. Ron Epstein, a senior analyst at Bank of America, says the U.S. is expected to spend around $1 trillion on defense next year, and that he has buy ratings on all the major companies in the sector. But he singled out RTX (ticker RTX) as occupying a particularly strong position thanks to its Raytheon division’s “fantastic missile franchise” and because its military business is complemented by a successful commercial aircraft unit. Those with qualms about investing in weapons may prefer to put their money into the cybersecurity sector instead. There are a host of publicly traded companies that tout their ability to protect networks and thwart cyberattacks, including the growing number of attacks generated by AI. But performance across the sector has been uneven, as underscored by CrowdStrike, which issued a faulty update in July that grounded Delta’s fleet of planes and cost the airline and other clients billions of dollars One cyber company on an upswing is Fortinet (FTNT), based in Sunnyvale, Calif., with well over $5 billion in annual revenue. Like others in the sector, it does not issue dividends and has a fairly high P/E ratio. At the same time, Fortinet’s share price has handily outperformed the broader market and most of its peers. Founded in 2000, the company is a trusted name in the industry and offers a wide variety of services, catering to a range of sectors such as finance, health care, education, and government. Some investors who foresee global turmoil roiling markets may prefer to avoid individual company stocks altogether, and bet instead on volatility and uncertainty itself. While there are ETFs that loosely track the so-called VIX fear gauge, such plays are for sophisticated, active investor and don’t belong in a buy-and-hold portfolio. A better option for those betting on ongoing turmoil is old-fashioned gold—specifically, through an ETF like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) that permits you to hold the yellow metal at a reasonable cost. While GLD prices sank in November after the election of Donald Trump, many expect the ETF to continue its recent strong run. Goldman Sachs predicts gold will reach more than $3,000 an ounce in 2025, as conflict and trouble keep the world on edge. —J.J.R. This year has not been kind to the luxury sector. The share prices of upscale companies like Burberry Group, Kering, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Movado are all down year to date. This is the result of Americans tightening their purse strings, but also because Chinese consumers—one of the luxury sector’s most important pillars—are feeling pinched by the country’s real estate crisis. But all this offers an opportunity for the discerning investor, says Jelena Sokolova, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. For the past 30 years, data shows that a luxury down cycle hasn’t lasted more than one to three years—pointing to how high-end consumers can’t stay away from the finer things in life for long. Typically, the industry bounces back quite strongly after those downturns,” says Sokolova. “For a long term perspective, I think there is still potential there.” For the best bets in the luxury space, long-term brand preservation is everything, says Deiya Pernas, cofounder of Pernas Research. Whether the brand “stays true to its heritage” is a key differentiator in this sector, he says, as is its ability to expand its offerings into new categories. According to Sokolova, one brand well poised for a luxury market rebound is Prada (PRDSY), thanks in part to Miu Miu, its stylish sister brand and an up-and-coming industry power player. Its popularity among younger consumers—including those likely to benefit from an upcoming massive intergenerational wealth transfer—has helped the Italian fashion house defy the larger luxury downturn, as Miu Miu notched an eye-popping 105% year-over-year increase in retail sales in the third quarter, to around $347 million. Meanwhile, revenues for the larger Prada fashion group were up in nine months to $4.1 billion, an 18% jump. Another standout in the sector is ultra-luxury brand Hermès (HESAY), whose clientele consists of the 1% of the 1%, and which has been largely insulated from the slump that has seen the share price of rival LVMH fall over 10% year to date. The French-listed Hermès, in contrast, has reported double-digit sales growth every quarter this year. While other luxury brands have been disproportionately affected by slipping sales from their aspirational client segments, Hermès has more customers than it can materially accommodate: The wait lists for its most-sought-after products, the $10,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags, continue to grow, as the world’s wealthiest clamor for something they can’t simply walk in and buy off the shelf. Meanwhile, shares of Hermès competitor Kering (KER.PA) are down over 40% year-to-date but analysts expect a bounceback, making this luxury brand a potential bargain. —Alicia Adamczyk The world is consuming more energy than ever—and the trend is going in only one direction. Consider that a single Google search consumes 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency, but a similar query on OpenAI takes 2.9 wh. And then there are electric cars and our growing collection of always-on gadgets, which contributed to a global record for energy consumption last year, according to the Energy Institute. Powering all this is an increasingly diverse set of energy sources—all of which offer opportunities for investors in 2025. In a sign of the times, the AI boom is poised to resurrect Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The plant’s owner, Constellation Energy (CEG), will spend $1.6 billion over the next four years to restart its undamaged Unit 1 reactor, betting that nuclear has the potential to deliver a massive revenue boost. The bet looks promising, as the company has already signed a deal with Microsoft to supply the software giant’s data centers with nuclear power for at least the next 20 years. The share price of Constellation, America’s largest owner of nuclear plants, has more than doubled this year. Wall Street expects the company to post yearly earnings growth of 30% for 2024, while Visible Alpha predicts free cash flows could reach $1.5 billion. Building new plants is a regulatory nightmare, notes CFRA Research’s Daniel Reuven Rich, which gives existing operators an advantage. “They’re the only game in town,” he says, and it’s become a lucrative one. A thousand miles south, and 250 miles off the coast of New Orleans, the oil and gas company TechnipFMC (FTI) is building an elaborate network of manifolds and umbilical cords for between $250 million and $500 million to help oil giant BP extract 80,000 barrels of oil a day. Last quarter alone, the U.K.-incorporated company doing business from Houston secured $2.5 billion in subsea orders, adding to a backlog of $14.7 billion. Shareholders received $394 million in dividends and share buybacks in the first nine months of 2024 alone. But ATB Capital Markets analyst Waqar Syed says that’s only the beginning. Even as the company is projected to pull in around $9 billion in annual revenue, Syed says the backlog means not all the cash has been counted. “Orders are coming in at a much higher rate than the revenues are,” he says. “At some point their revenue is going to catch up.” Syed predicts FTI’s future cash flows will increase 76% in 2025 to $859.2 million, and the company has committed to return at least 60% of its future cash flow to shareholders. Looking abroad, it may be a good time to consider Spanish energy giant Iberdrola (IBDRY). Through its public U.S. subsidiary, Avangrid, it has doubled down on its renewable investments in the U.S., particularly with offshore wind. The company has pumped a combined $13.28 billion into projects in America and the U.K. over the past year, helping drive a 50% boost in net income through the first nine months of 2024. —Michael del Castillo and Greg Mckenna Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the explosive demand for artificial intelligence has driven a broader stock market boom. Public companies directly tied to the field have seen their market caps skyrocket, while industries even tangentially related to AI—such as the once-unloved utility sector—have enjoyed a bump. Given all the hype, skeptical investors may fear the sector has crossed the line from boom to bubble, but many analysts say AI stocks still have room to run. Starting with pure plays, it’s hard to bet against the company at the heart of the AI boom: Nvidia (NVDA). There is a ravenous appetite for its flagship GPU chips from a wide variety of companies scrambling to keep pace in the AI era. One analyst closely following the company, CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino, said that Nvidia’s total addressable market is only set to expand. Its sales totaled $30 billion last quarter, up 122% from a year ago, and Zino expects the figure to surge upwards of $50 billion in two years’ time. He expects quarterly free cash flow to soon exceed that of every firm but Apple. It also stands to reason that Nvidia’s most deep-pocketed customers are the best positioned to make the necessary capital expenditures. “The big are only going to get bigger,” says Baird’s Ted Mortonson. “The monopolies are going to get more monopolistic.” Even among the giants of Big Tech, Microsoft (MSFT) is the leading high roller, with Bloomberg Intelligence projecting the company’s capital outlay could hit $53 billion this year. That capex is already generating sales, according to CEO Satya Nadella, who says Microsoft’s AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion. Microsoft has invested $14 billion alone in OpenAI since 2019—the main reason Mortonson believes the Seattle-based cloud titan is the best pick among the traditional tech outfits. Shares recently had their worst day in two years after the company forecast cloud growth to slow next quarter, presenting a potential opportunity to “buy the dip.” That may also be the case in application software, a sector yet to realize the benefits of AI. Salesforce (CRM) has been far from a Wall Street darling recently, with the stock trailing the S&P 500 and posting revenue growth in the single digits. Zino, however, believes the company is well positioned to deliver on so-called agentic AI—think autonomous digital assistants that put generative AI into action. “We think by the end of 2025 there are going to be a lot of investors that really kind of warm up to the Salesforce story,” Zino said. Not everyone agrees. Mortonson, for example, prefers cloud computing platform ServiceNow, which benefits from a close partnership with Nvidia. For those who believe in Salesforce’s long-term AI prospects, however, buying now could prove a bargain. —Leo Schwartz and G.M. According to a report by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, the number of people getting active has increased every year for a decade. The report adds that threefourths of the U.S. population, or 242 million people, participated in at least one sports or fitness activity in 2023, a 2.2% bump from 2022. For investors looking to capitalize on this trend, the sporting-goods sector is a solid bet. According to David Swartz, a Morningstar senior equity analyst, the field includes names like Adidas, Lululemon, Under Armour, and Puma. But he says one company stands out above the others. “Nike (NKE) has a closer relationship with global and American sports than any other company,” Swartz tells Fortune. Nike’s stock has been pummeled this year over strategic missteps, including a failure to develop new products and a disastrous decision to favor direct-to-consumer distribution. But Morningstar believes it is now undervalued compared with its long-term fair value estimate of $117 per share. Morningstar forecasts compound average sales growth of 5% over the next 10 years, and expects Nike will achieve compound annual revenue growth of 2% in North America. Nike’s stock hit an all-time high of $177.51 in November 2021, but has since dropped by almost 50%. Swartz believes the company is poised for a comeback now that longtime Nike exec Elliott Hill is at the helm—he returned in October—and that Nike “will benefit from the growth of sports, both in the U.S. and globally.” Alongside the trend in increased physical activity is a new focus on self-care. This includes technology that identifies health risks for women, including breast cancer detection. A leading player in the field is Hologic (HOLX), a health care company with around $4 billion in annual revenue that provides 3D mammography technology. It has an 80%-plus share of the U.S. mammography imaging market and 30% internationally, according to Andrew Brackmann, a William Blair equity research analyst. Hologic, which has about 7,000 employees, also offers a range of tests for sexually transmitted infections as well as COVID-19. Since 2021, Hologic has scooped up seven companies and grown earnings at a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate over the past decade, Brackmann tells Fortune. Hologic’s stock is up about 16% this year. The growing field of prenatal diagnosis also offers an opportunity for investors, especially as preterm births in the U.S. have jumped by more than 10% in the past decade. In this field, Brackmann recommends a small firm called Sera Prognostics (SERA), which has created a blood test, called PreTRM, that helps identify which women may deliver prematurely. “There is a massive market need,” he says. Sera, which employs around 63 people, went public in 2021 but has never traded at or near its $16 IPO price. In August, Sera said it plans to publish the results of its PRIME study for the PreTRM test in the spring of 2025. Sera hasn’t gotten much traction with doctors, who have asked for more data, Brackmann says. “When the publication comes out it will generate a lot of buzz,” he notes. He expects Sera, which currently has negligible revenue, to bring in more than $100 million over the next three to five years. —Sheryl Estrada and Luisa Beltran At a time when the country was reeling from soaring prices, Fortune set about to pick 13 “inflation-proof” stocks. How did we do? In the 12 months since we published in November 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 delivered a 34% total return. Our portfolio: 51%. That’s not to say all our picks were winners. Two were blockbusters: chip darling Nvidia (total return, 193%) and big data company Palantir (179%). Other outperformers included e-commerce giant Mercado Libre and hefty dividend payers Kinder Morgan (pipelines) and Boston Properties (real estate). The other eight trailed the S&P, though none delivered negative returns. (Procter & Gamble, the worst performer, still gained 6%.) But overall, the home runs far outweighed the strikeouts. —Matt Heimer This article appears in the December 2024/January 2025 edition of Fortune with the headline “5 trends for 2025 and how to invest in them.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: 5 investing trends for 2025—and 15 stocks to help you bet on them

Picking stocks is about predicting the future. As investors can tell you, being early to spot a trend and betting on a company poised to ride it can translate to a handsome return. Those who bought Amazon in 1998, for example, or Tesla in 2012, or Nvidia in 2020 correctly foresaw the respective explosions of online shopping, EVs, and the AI revolution—and made out like bandits. Of course, this isn’t easy to do. One issue is timing. A thesis about the future of a sector might be correct, but it may still be years away. Betting on the right sector but the wrong horse can also be painful, as investors in bankrupt EV maker Fisker or fallen chip giant Intel can attest. In the past, a relatively safe way to invest in macro trends has been to buy so-called cyclical stocks (think travel or entertainment) when the economy is on an upswing, and defensive ones (think consumer staples) when times are bad. Today, though, broader forces like tech transformation and geopolitical upheaval have made this model less reliable. In recent years, for example, utility stocks—a classic defensive play—have been on a tear, while the dominance of the tech-heavy group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven has been a bigger story than any discrepancy between cyclical and defensive stocks. The investment landscape may grow more unpredictable still as Donald Trump prepares his return to the White House. Nonetheless, Fortune’s finance team put our heads together to come up with stock ideas for the coming year. We began by identifying five trends, and then picking three companies set to ride each of those waves in 2025. In some cases, our picks reflect the ongoing march of technology. Other trends such as geopolitical risk—named by CEOs in a recent Deloitte-Fortune survey as having the biggest potential to create disruption—and health and wellness reflect broader political and social shifts. Finally, markets are unpredictable, so treat the stock picks noted here not as advice, but as a departure point for your own research into which companies might shine in the coming year. —Jeff John Roberts In recent years, the world has become more dangerous as war has broken out in the Middle East and on Europe’s doorstep in Ukraine, while tensions remain high in the Taiwan Strait. According to the think tank Institute for Economics & Peace, there are currently 56 armed conflicts around the globe, the highest number since World War II. Meanwhile, numerous reports show a year-over-year double-digit increase in cyberattacks, as bandits and national armies seek to steal data and wreak havoc. These trends are worrisome but also present an opportunity for investors. The conflicts around the globe have produced a shortage of weapons, particularly missiles and missile defense, making companies that cater to militaries a good bet for 2025. Ron Epstein, a senior analyst at Bank of America, says the U.S. is expected to spend around $1 trillion on defense next year, and that he has buy ratings on all the major companies in the sector. But he singled out RTX (ticker RTX) as occupying a particularly strong position thanks to its Raytheon division’s “fantastic missile franchise” and because its military business is complemented by a successful commercial aircraft unit. Those with qualms about investing in weapons may prefer to put their money into the cybersecurity sector instead. There are a host of publicly traded companies that tout their ability to protect networks and thwart cyberattacks, including the growing number of attacks generated by AI. But performance across the sector has been uneven, as underscored by CrowdStrike, which issued a faulty update in July that grounded Delta’s fleet of planes and cost the airline and other clients billions of dollars One cyber company on an upswing is Fortinet (FTNT), based in Sunnyvale, Calif., with well over $5 billion in annual revenue. Like others in the sector, it does not issue dividends and has a fairly high P/E ratio. At the same time, Fortinet’s share price has handily outperformed the broader market and most of its peers. Founded in 2000, the company is a trusted name in the industry and offers a wide variety of services, catering to a range of sectors such as finance, health care, education, and government. Some investors who foresee global turmoil roiling markets may prefer to avoid individual company stocks altogether, and bet instead on volatility and uncertainty itself. While there are ETFs that loosely track the so-called VIX fear gauge, such plays are for sophisticated, active investor and don’t belong in a buy-and-hold portfolio. A better option for those betting on ongoing turmoil is old-fashioned gold—specifically, through an ETF like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) that permits you to hold the yellow metal at a reasonable cost. While GLD prices sank in November after the election of Donald Trump, many expect the ETF to continue its recent strong run. Goldman Sachs predicts gold will reach more than $3,000 an ounce in 2025, as conflict and trouble keep the world on edge. —J.J.R. This year has not been kind to the luxury sector. The share prices of upscale companies like Burberry Group, Kering, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Movado are all down year to date. This is the result of Americans tightening their purse strings, but also because Chinese consumers—one of the luxury sector’s most important pillars—are feeling pinched by the country’s real estate crisis. But all this offers an opportunity for the discerning investor, says Jelena Sokolova, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. For the past 30 years, data shows that a luxury down cycle hasn’t lasted more than one to three years—pointing to how high-end consumers can’t stay away from the finer things in life for long. Typically, the industry bounces back quite strongly after those downturns,” says Sokolova. “For a long term perspective, I think there is still potential there.” For the best bets in the luxury space, long-term brand preservation is everything, says Deiya Pernas, cofounder of Pernas Research. Whether the brand “stays true to its heritage” is a key differentiator in this sector, he says, as is its ability to expand its offerings into new categories. According to Sokolova, one brand well poised for a luxury market rebound is Prada (PRDSY), thanks in part to Miu Miu, its stylish sister brand and an up-and-coming industry power player. Its popularity among younger consumers—including those likely to benefit from an upcoming massive intergenerational wealth transfer—has helped the Italian fashion house defy the larger luxury downturn, as Miu Miu notched an eye-popping 105% year-over-year increase in retail sales in the third quarter, to around $347 million. Meanwhile, revenues for the larger Prada fashion group were up in nine months to $4.1 billion, an 18% jump. Another standout in the sector is ultra-luxury brand Hermès (HESAY), whose clientele consists of the 1% of the 1%, and which has been largely insulated from the slump that has seen the share price of rival LVMH fall over 10% year to date. The French-listed Hermès, in contrast, has reported double-digit sales growth every quarter this year. While other luxury brands have been disproportionately affected by slipping sales from their aspirational client segments, Hermès has more customers than it can materially accommodate: The wait lists for its most-sought-after products, the $10,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags, continue to grow, as the world’s wealthiest clamor for something they can’t simply walk in and buy off the shelf. Meanwhile, shares of Hermès competitor Kering (KER.PA) are down over 40% year-to-date but analysts expect a bounceback, making this luxury brand a potential bargain. —Alicia Adamczyk The world is consuming more energy than ever—and the trend is going in only one direction. Consider that a single Google search consumes 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency, but a similar query on OpenAI takes 2.9 wh. And then there are electric cars and our growing collection of always-on gadgets, which contributed to a global record for energy consumption last year, according to the Energy Institute. Powering all this is an increasingly diverse set of energy sources—all of which offer opportunities for investors in 2025. In a sign of the times, the AI boom is poised to resurrect Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The plant’s owner, Constellation Energy (CEG), will spend $1.6 billion over the next four years to restart its undamaged Unit 1 reactor, betting that nuclear has the potential to deliver a massive revenue boost. The bet looks promising, as the company has already signed a deal with Microsoft to supply the software giant’s data centers with nuclear power for at least the next 20 years.

Title: Nvidia nearly doubles AMD's R&D budget – Intel's spending dwarfs both, but struggles to compete

The big picture: The competitive strength of hardware makers is often gauged by their research and development expenditure. However, an analysis of recent financial reports from various tech giants reveals that higher R&D spending does not always guarantee success. Intel's recent struggles and Nvidia's astronomical growth driven by the AI boom have broken conventional assumptions. Recent insights from Tech Fund reveal a widening disparity in R&D budgets between competing hardware makers AMD and Nvidia, a key factor in Nvidia's increasing market dominance. In that same mix we could look at Intel, which currently appears much weaker than both despite dwarfing their R&D spending. According to Tech Fund's analysis of Nvidia's and AMD's R&D expenditures over the past decade, Nvidia now spends twice as much as AMD. In 2013, their R&D budgets were roughly equal, but Nvidia's has since surged to approximately $12 billion, while AMD's has grown to ~$6 billion. $NVDA is widening the R&D gap with its closest competitor. Annualizing last quarter's R&D spend, NVDA is investing now almost at twice the level of $AMD. And the latter will have to split R&D between GPUs, CPUs and FPGAs, whereas NVDA can fully focus on building out the AI stack. pic.twitter.com/nL4BpTPNeU This disparity is further accentuated by the allocation of spending. Nvidia focuses nearly all its R&D efforts on AI, while AMD's smaller budget is spread across GPUs, CPUs, AI, and FPGA chips. Although AMD has made impressive gains in the CPU market – recent generations of its CPUs have soundly defeated Intel – it continues to struggle against Nvidia in the GPU sector. Intel currently faces seemingly endless trouble in CPUs, GPUs, and other areas despite outspending Nvidia's and AMD's R&D by a wide margin. Source: Tom's Hardware (click to enlarge) According to Tom's Hardware, Intel allocated $16 billion to R&D in 2023 – double the combined budgets of Nvidia and AMD. For 2024, the company projects R&D, market growth, and acquisition costs will range between $17 billion and $20 billion. These funds are spread across diverse ventures, including CPUs, GPUs, quantum computing, and foundries, with significant hopes pinned on its forthcoming 18A process node. Source: App Economy Insights Despite this hefty investment, Intel's market capitalization hovers at around $107 billion, ranking 160th globally. In contrast, AMD ranks 45th with a valuation of $229 billion or more than twice of Chipzilla's. Nvidia, with its near-total devotion to AI, has entered the $3 trillion club and is vying with Apple for the title of the world's most valuable company. Nvidia's meteoric rise is particularly striking when compared to Apple's R&D spending. The Cupertino giant spent $27 billion on R&D in 2023 and $31 billion between September 2023 and September 2024. While some predict the eventual collapse of the AI bubble, which could bring Nvidia back down to Earth, there are no immediate signs of such a downturn.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “”The important thing is not to stop questioning; curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when contemplating the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of the mystery every day. The important thing is not to stop questioning; never lose a holy curiosity.” – Albert Einstein (from statement to William Miller, as quoted in LIFE magazine (May 2, 1955)) Number of the Week: 14 Drilling Records THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with Richard Lindzen’s discussion on recent political movements that falsely claim to be based on science. Vijay Jayaraj discusses a conference of important nations that the legacy media missed, or misrepresented. Delancyplace.com discusses a few issues in Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Roy Spencer and John Christy discuss corrections needed to the measurements by satellites when the satellites drift too far from the planned orbit. Owen Klinsky alerts the US to the Winter Reliability Assessment by North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Roger Caiazza continues to express concern over New York’s future reliance on Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resources (DEFR), that appears imaginary. A brief discussion on a Bomb Cyclone concludes this Week. ************* Rumors State: Some of the most misleading arguments for drastic action to “combat climate change” include phrases such as “The Science says.” Science says nothing; in physical science it is the physical evidence that reveals the validity of a claim. Writing in the American Mind, MIT Professor emeritus of Atmospheric Science Richard Lindzen reveals “How a political movement invented its own scientific basis.” He begins with: “Modern political movements have frequently laid claim to being based in science, from immigration restriction and eugenics (in the U.S. after WWI), to antisemitism and race ideology (in Hitler’s Germany), to Communism and Lysenkoism (under Stalin). Each of these falsely invoked a scientific consensus that convinced highly educated citizens, who were nonetheless ignorant of science, to set aside the anxieties associated with their ignorance. Since all scientists supposedly agreed, there was no need for them to understand the science. Of course, this version of “the science” is the opposite of science itself. Science is a mode of inquiry rather than a source of authority. However, the success that science achieves has earned it a measure of authority in the public’s mind. This is what politicians frequently envy and exploit. The climate panic fits into this same pattern and, as in all the preceding cases, science is in fact irrelevant. At best, it is a distraction which has led many of us to focus on the numerous misrepresentations of science entailed in what was purely a political movement.” Lindzen traces how the political movement began to demonize carbon dioxide, essential for photosynthesis, which creates the food required for all complex life, then asserts: “Excited politicians, confronted by this resistance, have frantically changed their story. Rather than emphasizing small changes in their temperature metric (which, itself, is a false measure of climate), they now point to weather extremes which occur almost daily some place on earth, as proof not only of climate change but of climate change due to increasing CO2 (and now also to even more negligible contributors to the greenhouse effect like methane and nitrous oxide). Such extremes show no significant correlation with the emissions. From the political point of view, however, extremes provide convenient visuals that have more emotional impact than small temperature changes. Birth of a Consensus The desperation of political figures often drives them as far as to claim that climate change is an existential threat (associated with alleged “tipping points”). This despite a complete absence of theoretical or observational support, and despite the fact that official documents produced to support climate concerns (for example, the Working Group 1 reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC) never come close to substantiating these worst-case projections. There was one exception to the obsession with warming, and that was the ozone depletion issue. However, even this issue served a purpose. When Richard Benedick, the American negotiator of the Montreal Convention which banned Freon, passed through MIT on his way back from Montreal, he gloated over his success. But he assured us that we hadn’t seen anything yet: we should wait to see what they would do with CO2. In brief, the ozone issue constituted a dry run for global warming. To be sure, the EPA’s activities still include conventional pollution control, but energy dominates. Of course, the attraction of power is not the only thing motivating politicians. The ability to award trillions of dollars to reorient our energy sector means that there are recipients of these trillions of dollars. These recipients must share just a few percentage points of these trillions of dollars to support the campaigns of these politicians for many election cycles and guarantee the support of these politicians for the policies associated with the reorientation.” The essay is a severe indictment of the IPCC and its collaborators who ignore the physical evidence in favor of politicized reports as found in the IPCC Summaries for Policymakers. Now in the 29th annual meeting (COP-29), the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are demanding trillions of dollars in payment for the imagined harm that carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels are claimed to cause. Yet the use of fossil fuels (hydrocarbons) helped take the bulk of humanity out of dire poverty. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and After Paris! ************* Ignoring the Other World: In the sound and fury created by COP-29, the legacy media ignored or misrepresented another international conference that may become more important than the UN conferences – the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, now including other nations) conference held October 22 to October 24. Vijay Jayaraj of the CO2 Coalition writes: “Attendees of the 16th annual BRICS summit represented more than 45% of the global population and 35% of global gross domestic product and included representatives of Saudi Arabia, China, India, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates. At the heart of the declaration lies a fundamental truth that the Western climate industrial complex often refuses to recognize: Access to affordable and reliable energy and economic development cannot be sacrificed at the altar of ‘decarbonization’ if people are to thrive. The BRICS leaders emphasize that their immediate goals — poverty eradication, infrastructure development, and economic expansion — require a secure and stable energy supply.” In BRICS-16’s Kazan Declaration, the attendees recognize that the path to prosperity is not from demanding payments from others for alleged harms from carbon dioxide, but by promoting affordable and reliable energy, as it has been since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The environmental ills created by industrialization can be and are cleaned up and are minor compared to the ills of extreme poverty. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ************* Randomness: The daily blog, Delancyplace.com, was founded by Richard Vague and financed by the Governor’s Woods Foundation. It has no particular theme but produces interesting tidbits. On November 20, it covered Randomness and Reality. The piece began with: “Today’s selection–from Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Randomness comes to Wall Street: “’Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands, of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. The point is dubbed in this book the black swan problem, which we cover in Chapter 7, as it is linked to the problem of induction, a problem that has kept a few thinkers awake at night. It is also related to a problem called denigration of history, as gamblers, investors, and decision-makers feel that the sorts of things that happen to others would not necessarily happen to them. “’Second, unlike a well-defined, precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. Very rarely is the generator visible to the naked eye. One is thus capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette—and calling it by some alternative ‘low risk’ name. We see the wealth being generated, never the processor, a matter that makes people lose sight of their risks, and never consider the losers. The game seems terribly easy, and we play along carelessly. Even scientists with all their sophistication in calculating probabilities cannot deliver any meaningful answer about the odds, since knowledge of these depends on our witnessing the barrel of reality—of which we generally know nothing.’” Randomness occurs, such as an asteroid striking Earth and wiping out a whole class of life on Earth. These cannot be predicted or the causes known until after they occur. In climate history there appear to be random events that have not been explained such as the Younger Dryas, a period about 12,900 to 11,700 years ago beginning with sudden cooling and ending with sudden warming. Most life survived the Younger Dryas, a fact that is ignored by those who claim that the current slow warming will eliminate many species. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Changing Seas. ************* Imperfect Instruments: On November 2, Roy Spencer posted the October 2024 estimates of temperature trends which contains an explanation of a shift in calculations and why it was necessary. TWTW waited until the full Global Temperature Report for October by John Christy and Spencer was available before discussing this change. The full report is available now. Earlier Spencer wrote: [Boldface in Original] “Key Points Background Monitoring of global atmospheric deep-layer temperatures with satellite microwave radiometers (systems originally designed for daily global weather monitoring) has always required corrections and adjustments to the calibrated data to enable long-term trend detection. The most important of these corrections/adjustments are: The second of these adjustments (diurnal drift) is the subject of the change made going from UAH v6.0 to v6.1. The following chart shows the equator crossing times (local solar time) for the various satellites making up the satellite temperature record. The drift of the satellites (except the non-drifting Aqua and MetOp satellites, which have fuel onboard to allow orbit maintenance) produces cooling for the afternoon satellites’ LT measurements as the afternoon observation transitions from early afternoon to evening. Drift of the morning satellites makes their LT temperatures warm as their evening observations transition to the late afternoon.” Spencer graphically shows the drift in satellites used since 1979 with various truncations including the one for NOAA-19 and explains: “Note that the NOAA-19 satellite has drifted further in local observation time than any of the previous afternoon satellites. The NOAA-19 local observation times have been running outside our training dataset which includes the assumption of a linear diurnal temperature drift with time. So, we have decided it is now necessary to truncate the data from NOAA-19 starting in 2021, which we are now doing as of the October 2024 update. Thus, begins Version 6.1 of our dataset, a name change meant to reduce confusion and indicate a significant change in our processing. As seen in the above figure [not shown here], 2020 as the last year of NOAA-19 data inclusion is roughly consistent with the v6.0 cutoff times from the NOAA-18 and NOAA-14 (afternoon) satellites. This type of change in our processing is analogous to changes we have made in previous years, after a few years of data being collected to firmly establish a problem exists. The time lag is necessary because we have previously found that two operating satellites in different orbits can diverge in their processed temperatures, only to converge again later. As will be shown below, we now have sufficient reason to truncate the NOAA-19 data record starting in 2021. Why Do We Even Include a Satellite if it is Drifting in Local Observation Time? The reasons why a diurnally drifting satellite is included in processing (with imperfect adjustments) are three-fold: (1) most satellites in the 1979-2024 period of record drifted, and so their inclusion was necessary to make a complete, intercalibrated satellite record of temperatures; (2) two operational satellites (usually one drifting much more than the other) provide more complete sampling during the month for our gridded dataset, which has 2.5 deg. lat/lon resolution; (3) having two (or sometimes 3) satellites allows monitoring of potential drifts, i.e., the time series of the difference between 2 satellite measurements should remain relatively stable over time. Version 6.1 Brings the UAH Data closer to RSS and NOAA in the Last Few Years Several people have noted that our temperature anomalies have been running warmer than those from the RSS or NOAA satellite products. It now appears this was due to the orbital drift of NOAA-19 beyond the useful range of our drift correction. The following plot (preliminary, provided to me by John Christy) [plot in original and not shown here] shows that truncation of the NOAA-19 record now brings the UAH anomalies more in line with the RSS and NOAA products.” [Boldface added here] Spencer stated that the full explanation by Christy and him may take a few days “due to the changes resulting from going from v6.0 to v6.1 of the dataset.” On this issue the post on the “Global Temperature Report: October 2024 with Version 6.1” state: “In the last two months we’ve suggested some reasons for the continued exceptional warmth of the global atmosphere even as the El Niño was fading away. One of the causes mentioned was the possibility that the correction for the drift of the aging NOAA-19 satellite was unable to keep up with its continued movement and produced spurious warmth over the last few years. By comparing the two current satellites, and especially since Europe’s MetOP-B does not drift due to on-board propulsion, we’ve concluded that the adjustment for NOAA-19’s drift was inadequate, generating temperatures that were too warm as time went on. This same situation has occurred in the past where we initially utilized old satellites beyond their normal lifespan (e.g., NOAA-14, -15, -18 and AQUA) and retroactively removed the latest portion of their records when errors progressively became large enough to affect the anomalies of the last few years. We have now decided to terminate the inclusion of NOAA-19 from 2021 onward. With this adjustment we will identify the product as v6.1. At some point in the near future, we intend to include MetOp-C in the record, so this may introduce some minor changes at that time. This adjustment produces cooler temperatures after 2021 but does not change the facts that (a) 2023 was the warmest calendar year (and 2024 will be warmer still), (b) April 2024 produced the warmest single monthly anomaly, and (c) every month from October 2023 to September 2024 set monthly temperature records. The overall global trend was reduced slightly from +0.16 to +0.15 °C/decade by this adjustment.” [Boldface added] Instruments fail, and when they cannot be replaced, adjustments must be made for the failure. Unlike the adjustments to the historic US surface dataset made by NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI), Asheville, the adjustments made by Spencer and Christy are public, carefully identified and justified, and recorded. Their actions demonstrate integrity in science, a characteristic which NCEI, Asheville lost. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ************* Beware of Cold: Owen Klinsky of the Daily Caller alerts the US public of the limited resources much of the US has if this winter is cold based on the 2024–2025 Winter Reliability Assessment by North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Klinsky writes: “Grid operators have requested the EPA nix the power plant rule in order to protect long-term energy dependability, with four major regional operators filing an amicus brief in support of red states’ legal challenge against the rule, stating it would jeopardize the grid’s ability to reliably meet American energy needs.” The Winter Reliability Assessment of NERC covers the three-month (December-February) winter period and evaluates the generation resource and transmission system adequacy necessary to meet projected winter peak demands and operating reserves. The assessment identifies potential reliability issues of interest and regional risks. It states: “Natural gas fuel to generators is threatened this winter by ongoing concerns with natural gas production and delivery in extreme conditions and a potential regional pipeline capacity issue in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Natural gas is an essential fuel for electricity generation in winter. While the natural gas industry is making progress on commercial practices and voluntary commitments to improve winter preparedness, supplies to electric generators remain vulnerable in extreme cold temperatures in many parts of North America, placing electric reliability at risk. As winter approaches, NERC encourages all entities across the gas-electric value chain—from production to the burner tip and the busbar—to take all necessary actions to prepare for extreme cold, keep natural gas flowing, and keep the lights and furnaces on. At the time of this WRA, the operator of a major interstate natural gas pipeline expansion project serving the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeast is facing legal challenges to the continued operation of the expanded pipeline. According to a recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) filing, a halting of the expanded pipeline operations would affect “firm transportation capacity in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.” These states correspond to the PJM, NPCC-New York, SERC-East, and SERC-Southeast assessment areas. During recent extreme winter weather events, each of these areas has experienced or come dangerously close to a shortfall in electricity supply for which fuel availability was a significant factor. Because foreseeable extreme cold temperatures have the potential to push the existing natural gas supply infrastructure to maximum capacity again this winter, a shutdown of in-service regional natural gas facilities would endanger grid reliability.” The failure of natural gas power plants in Texas during the last Blue Norther severe cold was due to the failure to have adequate supplies of natural gas on hand. This was a failure of the “just in time” policies of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). If this winter is cold, we will see whether this EPA and litigating environmental groups care about electrical reliability for the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states.

Caiazza summarizes his previous work and presents another analysis by Tim Knauss, based on the work of Cornell’s Anderson Lab headed by Lindsay Anderson. Knauss writes: “To back up the massive quantities of solar and wind power that will provide most of our future electricity, the state power grid will need some new, mystery resource equal in size to the entire generating fleet of today. That level of detail sets their work apart. Many of the studies that look at phasing in renewable energy pretend that the electric grid is a single pool of electrons that flow from point to point without constraint. It is known as the ‘copper plate’ assumption. In reality, the New York electric grid is a complex, lopsided network that has been stitched together piece by piece over a century. There are limits on how much electric current can move from one area to another. Based on Anderson’s work, Knauss writes: “At Cornell University, Professor Lindsay Anderson and fellow researchers have been studying this problem. Given the specific layout of New York’s electric grid, they asked, how much of this new power source would be needed in addition to all the solar and wind? A staggering amount, it turns out. Just 15 years from now, the electric grid will need about 40 gigawatts of new generating capacity that can be activated regardless of wind speeds, cloud cover or other weather conditions, according to Anderson’s research. How much is that? It’s roughly equal to the total capacity of all of New York’s current power plants – nuclear, natural gas, hydro, wind, all of it.” The enormous needs for back-up to wind and solar have been noted elsewhere, and completely ignored by those promoting Net Zero. See links under Energy Issues – US. ************* Bomb Cyclone: A rapid intensification of a cyclone is often referred to by colorful weather commentators as a bomb cyclone. The implication is that it is not predictable. In WUWT, Caribbean sailor Kip Hansen showed a video of a cyclone off the Northwest Coast of the US, and he considered it to be a bomb cyclone. Meteorologist Cliff Mass, in the Northwest, has a daily series on his blog showing that the cyclone was well predicted over five days. See links under Changing Weather. ************* Number of the Week: 14 Drilling Records. The paper authored by Thomas Westerhold and 23 others “An astronomically dated record of Earth’s climate and its predictability over the last 66 million years” in AAAS Science on Sep 11, 2020, was based on 14 drilling records compiled in the International Ocean Discovery Program and its predecessor programs. As discussed in the July 15, 2023, TWTW, when Willis Eschenbach unraveled the data, it revealed that contrary to the assertion that Earth’s temperatures changed with changing CO2; Earth’s temperatures remained roughly constant with significant changes in CO2. See https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba6853 for the paper and https://www.sepp.org/twtwfiles/2023/TWTW%207-15-23.pdf for the TWTW. Censorship “Misinformation” Means “Shut Up” By Ron Clutz, His Blog, Nov 21, 2024 Link to: Misinformation Is a Word We Use to Shut You Up By Daniel Klein, Brownstone Institute, May 31, 2023 From Klein: What is being labeled and attacked as “misinformation” is not a matter of true or false information, but of true or false knowledge—meaning that disagreement more commonly arises over interpretations and judgments as to which interpretations to take stock in or believe. We make judgments, “good” and “bad,” “wise” and “foolish,” about interpretations, “true” and “false.” One day to make submissions about the Under-16 social media ban (excuse to force Digital ID on us!)

By Justine Calma, The Verge, Nov 19, 2024 Brazil and the United Nations launched a new international effort to combat disinformation on climate change. They announced the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change during the G20 Leaders’ Summit taking place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. “Countries cannot tackle this problem individually,” President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in a press release.

IR radiation of clouds considerably reduces the greenhouse effect of CO2.” In total, around 200,000 frequency lines had to be taken into account in the relevant spectral range of 2.9 to 29 µm. Dr. Reinhart relied on the HITRAN program) for this analysis. This scientific software package offers the researcher comprehensive calculation tools, including the necessary databases. It calculates radiation reactions and radiation transport processes in all possible gases and gas mixtures according to the latest scientific and technical standards. Changes in atmospheric composition and density as well as their evolution with increasing altitude can be taken into account. HITRAN is used by scientists as well as satellite operators, meteorologists and the military due to the quality of its results. [SEPP Comment: HITRAN is the best database publicly available, but the precise number CO2 causing a warming of only 0.24°C is not clear.] Challenging the Orthodoxy Global Temperature Report: October 2024 with Version 6.1 By John Christy, Roy Spencer, Nov 4, 20224 Click to access GTR_202410OCT_v1.pdf Link to: UAH v6.1 Global Temperature Update for October 2024: +0.73 deg.

The findings made headlines around the world. The study kick-started the scientific field of “extreme event attribution”. [SEPP Comment: Additional false claims of probabilities are exposed by Clark.] Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 20, 2024 Politicians start with a dream, and when it goes sour, they too often refuse to admit it and instead prop it up. But the cost to the rest of us, including the poor to whom this money does not go directly from their fellows in charity or via the state, and the middle class whose power bills keep skyrocketing because politicians don’t know what “cheap” even means, is enormous. And how much are politicians’ delusions really worth anyway? We’re all Doomed. Yawn By Michael Kile, WUWT, Nov 21, 2024 Such a view arguably becomes more credible on discovering that WWA’s main benefactor is The Grantham Institute. It sits “at the heart of Imperial College London’s work on climate change and the environment, with the mission: “to lead on world-class research, policy, training and innovation that supports effective action on climate change.” [Italics by Kile] Grantham is right. Climate change has become a global “business”, presumably very profitable for “carbon” cowboys or green investors like GMO, at least unless the RE music stops for some reason, such as a decline in public gullibility about the “climate crisis”. Climate Debate on Social Media: Are the ‘Skeptics’ Winning? By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, Nov 22, 2024 After Paris! Green Activists Are Coming for Your Money By Paul Mueller, The Daily Economy, Nov 18, 2024 Cheap energy means a future of greater freedom and prosperity for everyone. Because eliminating all emissions is next to impossible, companies are being encouraged (or required) to buy offsets from other companies or countries that purport to pull a certain amount of carbon out of the air. There are many reasons to be skeptical of this whole project. The efficacy of carbon offsets is highly questionable because they create all kinds of bad incentives.

The proposal would require these plants to cut their emissions of pollutants known as nitrogen oxides, which can lead to smog formation and contribute to asthma in people with long-term exposure. From ATSDR sheet: HIGHLIGHTS: Everybody is exposed to small amounts of nitrogen oxides in ambient air. Higher exposure may occur by burning wood or kerosene or near gas stoves or if you smoke. Exposure to high levels of nitrogen oxides can damage the respiratory airways. Contact with the skin or eyes can cause burns. Nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide have been found in at least 9 and 6 of the 1,585 National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), respectively. What are nitrogen oxides? Nitrogen oxides are a mixture of gases that are composed of nitrogen and oxygen. Two of the most toxicologically significant nitrogen oxides are nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide; both are nonflammable and colorless to brown at room temperature. Nitric oxide is a sharp sweet-smelling gas at room temperature, whereas nitrogen dioxide has a strong, harsh odor and is a liquid at room temperature, becoming a reddish-brown gas above 70 °F. Nitrogen oxides do not build up in the food chain. [Boldface added] How can nitrogen oxides affect my health? Low levels of nitrogen oxides in the air can irritate your eyes, nose, throat, and lungs, possibly causing you to cough and experience shortness of breath, tiredness, and nausea.

The End Of Polar Bears By Tony Heller, His Blog, Nov 20, 2024 ARTICLES 1. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy: The DOGE Plan to Reform Government Following the Supreme Court’s guidance, we’ll reverse a decadeslong executive power grab. By Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, WSJ, Nov 20, 2024 TWTW Summary: the authors begin with: “Our nation was founded on the basic idea that the people we elect run the government. That isn’t how America functions today. Most legal edicts aren’t laws enacted by Congress, but ‘rules and regulations’ promulgated by unelected bureaucrats—tens of thousands of them each year. Most government enforcement decisions and discretionary expenditures aren’t made by the democratically elected president or even his political appointees but by millions of unelected, unappointed civil servants within government agencies who view themselves as immune from firing thanks to civil-service protections. This is antidemocratic and antithetical to the Founders’ vision. It imposes massive direct and indirect costs on taxpayers. Thankfully, we have a historic opportunity to solve the problem. On Nov. 5, voters decisively elected Donald Trump with a mandate for sweeping change, and they deserve to get it. President Trump has asked the two of us to lead a newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut the federal government down to size. The entrenched and ever-growing bureaucracy represents an existential threat to our republic, and politicians have abetted it for too long. That’s why we’re doing things differently. We are entrepreneurs, not politicians. We will serve as outside volunteers, not federal officials or employees. Unlike government commissions or advisory committees, we won’t just write reports or cut ribbons. We’ll cut costs. We are assisting the Trump transition team to identify and hire a lean team of small-government crusaders, including some of the sharpest technical and legal minds in America. This team will work in the new administration closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget. The two of us will advise DOGE at every step to pursue three major kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions and cost savings. We will focus particularly on driving change through executive action based on existing legislation rather than by passing new laws. Our North Star for reform will be the U.S. Constitution, with a focus on two critical Supreme Court rulings issued during President Biden’s tenure. In West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency (2022), the justices held that agencies can’t impose regulations dealing with major economic or policy questions unless Congress specifically authorizes them to do so. In Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024), the court overturned the Chevron doctrine and held that federal courts should no longer defer to federal agencies’ interpretations of the law or their own rulemaking authority. Together, these cases suggest that a plethora of current federal regulations exceed the authority Congress has granted under the law. DOGE will work with legal experts embedded in government agencies, aided by advanced technology, to apply these rulings to federal regulations enacted by such agencies. DOGE will present this list of regulations to President Trump, who can, by executive action, immediately pause the enforcement of those regulations and initiate the process for review and rescission. This would liberate individuals and businesses from illicit regulations never passed by Congress and stimulate the U.S. economy. When the president nullifies thousands of such regulations, critics will allege executive overreach. In fact, it will be correcting the executive overreach of thousands of regulations promulgated by administrative fiat that were never authorized by Congress. The president owes lawmaking deference to Congress, not to bureaucrats deep within federal agencies. The use of executive orders to substitute for lawmaking by adding burdensome new rules is a constitutional affront, but the use of executive orders to roll back regulations that wrongly bypassed Congress is legitimate and necessary to comply with the Supreme Court’s recent mandates. And after those regulations are fully rescinded, a future president couldn’t simply flip the switch and revive them but would instead have to ask Congress to do so. A drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy. DOGE intends to work with embedded appointees in agencies to identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions. The number of federal employees to cut should be at least proportionate to the number of federal regulations that are nullified: Not only are fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations, but the agency would produce fewer regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited. Employees whose positions are eliminated deserve to be treated with respect, and DOGE’s goal is to help support their transition into the private sector. The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit. Conventional wisdom holds that statutory civil-service protections stop the president or even his political appointees from firing federal workers. The purpose of these protections is to protect employees from political retaliation. But the statute allows for ‘reductions in force’ that don’t target specific employees. The statute further empowers the president to ‘prescribe rules governing the competitive service.’ That power is broad. Previous presidents have used it to amend the civil service rules by executive order, and the Supreme Court has held—in Franklin v. Massachusetts (1992) and Collins v. Yellen (2021) that they weren’t constrained by the Administrative Procedures Act when they did so. With this authority, Mr. Trump can implement any number of ‘rules governing the competitive service’ that would curtail administrative overgrowth, from large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area. Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home. Finally, we are focused on delivering cost savings for taxpayers. Skeptics question how much federal spending DOGE can tame through executive action alone. They point to the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which stops the president from ceasing expenditures authorized by Congress. Mr. Trump has previously suggested this statute is unconstitutional, and we believe the current Supreme Court would likely side with him on this question. But even without relying on that view, DOGE will help end federal overspending by taking aim at the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended, from $535 million a year to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and $1.5 billion for grants to international organizations to nearly $300 million to progressive groups like Planned Parenthood. TWTW Comment: A promising start to a difficult task. Contrary to those who claim that in ending the Chevron Deference, judges will replace bureaucrats for expert judgement; it will be the lawmakers who will need to do so. That is where the Constitution places the authority and the requirement for such expertise. Congress will not be able to pass the buck on difficult decisions by deferring to bureaucrats. I hope that Microsoft’s nuclear power doesn’t crash or freeze like its software sometimes does. CTRL + ALT + DEL solves EVERYTHING. Not everything. Somedays it is the off/on button that works best.

The rally created a spinning top candle, representing bull-bear equilibrium. Yesterday’s gap-up means that 23,956 becomes critical support, a daily close below which will re-embolden bears.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average logged a record close on Monday, as U.S. Treasury bonds saw their biggest rally in nearly four months after President-elect Donald Trump selected Scott Bessent as his nominee for Treasury secretary. President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices on everything from gas to automobiles. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that on his first day in office he will impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The announcement sparked a dollar rally. It rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 2% against the Mexican peso, while share markets in Asia fell, as did European equity futures ratcheting up concerns about his America First policies. Crude oil prices on Monday settled sharply lower on the back of speculation over a cease-fire in Lebanon, combined with what appears to be restraint on the part of Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce a ceasefire in Lebanon between armed group Hezbollah and Israel imminently, four senior Lebanese sources said on Monday. Asian shares were mostly lower on Tuesday on the back of Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on China, which could have an impact on other Asian economies. Nifty rose again on Nov 25 adding nearly 4% in two consecutive sessions of gains to regain its losses on a month-on-month basis. At close, Nifty was up 1.32% or 314.7 points at 24221.9. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates an upside breakout for the Nifty with an unfilled opening upside gap. If this gap remains unfilled for the next few sessions, it may mean formation of an important bottom reversal for Nifty around 23263 levels. In the near term 24500 could still pose some resistance for the Nifty while 23900 could offer support.

Title: Meta could outdo Google in the AI transformation, professor says

Despite being one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence research, Google (GOOGL) isn’t poised to be a winner of the transformation, according to a business professor. “While Google may have blazed the trail in artificial intelligence, it’s Meta (META) that’s poised to reap the rewards,” Howard Yu, LEGO Professor of Management and Innovation at IMD Business School, said in a written piece shared with Quartz. The reason according to Yu, who also leads the Center for Future Readiness, is about business models. “Google’s core business model — built on the elegance of simple search and link-clicking — is actually being undermined by AI,” Yu said, “while Meta’s advertising ecosystem is being supercharged by it.” For example, Meta’s AI-powered advertising system has been able to adapt after Apple’s (AAPL) introduction of its App Tracking Transparency feature, Yu said, which requires iOS apps to request user permission to track activity. Before, advertisers could track how users bought a product after seeing an ad. The tech giant’s probabilistic models “are working better than the old tracking system ever did,” Yu said. Meta is also “erasing the line between content and advertising,” Yu said, by using AI to make items in images and videos on social media feeds purchasable. The company “isn’t just creating ad inventory — it’s turning everything into potential inventory. And Meta’s partnership with EssilorLuxottica (EL) on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gives it an AI-advantage that doesn’t threaten its business. Meanwhile, Google is struggling to integrate AI into its products without threatening its search business, Yu said, which “thrives on simplicity, directing users to click on links that generate ad revenue.” With AI chatbots that can provide direct answers to queries, users don’t have to visit web pages where ads are placed. And Google’s other AI features, such as NotebookLM, “don’t necessarily strengthen its primary revenue stream.” Meta was the third-highest tech company on the Center for Future Readiness’s Future Readiness Indicator after Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), due to its “aggressive investments in AI” that show “strong momentum, impacting nearly all aspects of its operations,” the report said. Google parent Alphabet was the fourth-highest tech company on the list. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Volatility Amid Strong AI Demand and Growth Opportunities

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world-leading GPU designer whose products are powering the artificial intelligence industry. Since the release of ChatGPT to the public, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have gained 730%, making it clear that AI is baked into the firm's hypothesis. The firm's fortunes depend on its ability to not only design the best-performing chips but also to sustainably and predictably ship them in high volumes to customers while keeping margins high. Consequently, any turbulence on either the product design, shipping, or cost control fronts leads to tailwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares. Additionally, the high demand for its chips has meant that big tech is eager to find alternatives. The urgency for alternatives is also making companies design in-house AI chips, such as those from Amazon. As a result, unless NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) maintains its performance edge and logistics capabilities, the firm might see trouble in the future. Polen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "In a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market’s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock’s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (“GenAI”) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.” Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations. Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.” Overall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

These developments have led Axon to raise its Q4 revenue guidance to $560-570 million and project a full-year revenue exceeding $2.07 billion.

The company anticipates maintaining a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2025 and is on track to meet its 2025 revenue target one year early.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Talks Up Cooperation With China Ahead of Trump Trade War 2.0

Despite widespread fears that President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office will lead to tightened trade policies around A.I. chips to curb China’s tech advances, the CEO of Nvidia (NVDA), the largest manufacturer of A.I. chips, is still optimistic about the state of America’s relationship with China under the incoming administration. “Open research is one of the miracles of modern science and perhaps the ultimate form of global cooperation—one that we must protect,” Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday (Nov. 23) while accepting an honorary doctorate from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Huang, who lauded the region’s contributions towards technology like A.I., later told reporters that, while he doesn’t “know what’s going to happen with the new administration,” Nvidia will continue to balance policy and law compliance with innovative tech development.

You can opt out anytime. Nvidia’s booming GPU business has made it one of the world’s most valuable public companies, with a market cap of $3.38 trillion. However, like other chipmakers, its footprint in China has been shrinking in recent years amid growing geopolitical tensions and tightened export policies. Nvidia’s sales in China accounted for around 15 percent of its total revenue in the quarter ended September, a drop from 26 percent two years ago. In a continued effort under Trump’s first presidential term, the Biden administration in 2022 restricted Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China (including Hong Kong). Trump, who is poised to expand such measures, has also said he will enact tariffs in Taiwan, home to Nvidia’s largest supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). While supporting measured China policies, Huang lauded China’s “significant contributions to open science research helping to advance A.I. worldwide.” Over the years, Nvidia has benefitted from its presence in areas like Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, according to the CEO. “From the beginning, we’ve had the benefit and the great joy and privilege of watching the amazing tech industry form in China,” he said. As Huang received his honorary doctorate from HKUST, he highlighted the fact that the school’s alumni have helped found more than 1,800 startups that are still in operation today. “I’m thrilled to see so much energy focused on advancing the science of A.I. as well as using A.I. to advance at HKUST and across all of China,” he said. Thanks to developments across the new technology, “the greatest challenges of our time—unimaginable challenges to overcome in the past—all of a sudden seem possible to tackle,” he added. Earlier this month, Huang said that Nvidia will comply with whichever policies the Trump administration decides upon. “We’ll of course support the administration,” said Huang during an earnings call, adding Nvidia will also simultaneously continue to support its customers and compete in the marketplace.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rose on Monday as small caps rallied near new highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 400 points amid a broad sense of optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. The Dow increased 0.9% to close at a new record. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3%, despite Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. The Russell 2000 (^RUT), up 1.6%, also closed a whisker off a record high. It did notch an intraday high. Stocks kicked off a holiday-shortened week with more of the upbeat mood that lifted the gauges to weekly wins. Markets will shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and close early on Friday. Trump tapped Bessent, viewed as the "investor favorite" pick for Treasury, late Friday evening after a surprisingly drawn-out process that saw candidates' stocks seem to rise and fall by the day. Bessent's nomination has seemed to at least temporarily calm nerves over the president-elect's inflationary agenda, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dipping back under 4.3%. On the inflationary front, the Fed will get its preferred look at the picture heading into Trump's term with Wednesday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Economists expect a tick up in "core" PCE, which is closely watched by the central bank. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was in search of a milestone $100,000-per-coin level amid a near-50% surge over the past month. It was back down below $95,000 on Monday, however. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks rose on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closing at a fresh record after gaining more than 400 points, or nearly 1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also gained 0.3%, weighed by shares of Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. Meanwhile small cap stocks also rallied with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gaining as much as 2% during the session to hit record intraday highs. The index closed just shy of its all-time high record. The markets rose on Monday following President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Kamlani reports: Allurion (ALUR) launched a new program to provide patients access to compounded weight-loss drugs Monday after months of pitching its own weight-loss solution — an ingestible balloon — as an alternative for patients who may not want to use the popular injectable GLP-1 drugs. Allurion CEO Shantanu Gaur told Yahoo Finance that, like others, the company continues to see a spillover effect from the unprecedented interest in GLP-1 drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound. It's why the company is now offering copycat products at a fraction of the cost. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Tesla stock (TSLA) is down Monday following a strong recent run-up as one Wall Street bank says “animal spirits” have pushed the stock beyond any “fundamental change” at the company. Joseph Spak at UBS noted that Tesla stock has surged around 40% since the election, adding over $350 million to its market cap. While some of President-elect Donald Trump's policy proposals could favor Tesla, there are some policy negatives as well that would hurt fundamentals more than where the theoretical upside has taken the stock. “The rise in Tesla stock is mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history),” Spak wrote. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sank on Monday to $95,000 after recently jumping to record highs just a stone's throw away from $100,000. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady climb since the Donald Trump's presidential victory earlier this month. On Friday the token inched above $99,600. Year-to-date bitcoin is up about 120%. Cruise line stocks have had an impressive run this year, and there’s still more room for growth, according to Bank of America. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) have climbed more than 30% while Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is up over 80% year-to-date. Bank of America raised Norwegian's price target to $29 from $26 and kept a Neutral rating. For Carnival, the firm raised the price target to $28 from $24 and kept a Buy rating, while for Royal Caribbean, analysts raised the price target to $240 from $210 and kept a Neutral rating. “The travel industry is back,” Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora told Yahoo Finance. “It just seems like the core demographic here for cruise [lines], which is typically a bit higher income, they continue to be in a good spot from a discretionary spending perspective.” Cruise-line operators have seen a resurgence in demand as interest rebounded from the pandemic-era, when the restrictions kept fleets docked. Data from Bank of America shows that monthly cruise spending increased 8% in October on a yearly basis. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped to session lows, sinking more than 3% on Monday. The AI chip heavyweight was the worst performer among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell more than 1% while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) rose more than 1%. Nvidia's slide weighed on the Nasdaq, which briefly turned negative by 12:20 p.m. ET. Netflix (NFLX) shares also slid 3%, keeping a lid on the tech-heavy index. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) rose more than 2% on Monday to hit its highest level since November 2021. The small cap index has rallied in recent months as the Fed began its interest rate cutting cycle, fueling expectations of less expensive financing. The Russell 2000 is up more than 20% year-to-date, with much of those gains occurring since early August. Two more Wall Street strategists are projecting the bull market in US stocks will roll on in 2025. On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. "The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead," RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, wrote that with "inflation continuing to normalize, resilient macro, and Big Tech maintaining EPS growth leadership," the S&P 500 should continue its march higher. Read more here. MicroStrategy (MSTR) said Monday it purchased another 55,000 worth of bitcoin last week for $5.4 billion as the world's largest cryptocurrency was trading at all-time highs. MicroStrategy stock recovered from a loss of more than 7% in early trading. In a filing with the SEC, MicroStrategy said it spent $5.4 billion to acquire these bitcoin between Nov. 18-24, buying the bitcoin at an average price of $97,862. The company said it used proceeds from convertible notes and share sales to fund the purchase. The application software company, which has become a bitcoin proxy, has been buying tokens since 2020. In recent weeks, it has intensified its purchases as bitcoin has rallied to highs above $99,000 following Donald Trump's presidential win earlier this month. As of Sunday, MicroStrategy held a total of approximately 386,700 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate purchase price of about $21.9 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $56,761 per bitcoin. Oil dropped to session lows on a report that a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah may have been reached. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) sank more than 2% to hover below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded below $74 per barrel. Axios reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon have agreed to terms of a ceasefire, citing a senior US official. Earlier, the Israeli ambassador to Washington said in a radio interview on Monday that deal points still need to be finalized but an agreement "can happen within days.” Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped as much as 3% in early trading as the AI chip heavyweight failed to participate in the rest of the market gains. Nvidia shares extended their decline from Friday's session, despite the company beating on quarterly results announced last week. The AI chipmaker has been a leader in the overall markets this year, accounting for roughly 20% of the S&P 500's performance. US stocks rose on Monday as investors await the Fed's preferred measure of inflation this week and after President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the advance, up roughly 0.7%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while those the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up almost 0.6%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index will be released this Wednesday, giving investors clues on what the Fed's next move with interest rates may be.

MicroStrategy stock recovered from a loss of more than 7% in early trading. In a filing with the SEC, MicroStrategy said it spent $5.4 billion to acquire these bitcoin between Nov. 18-24, buying the bitcoin at an average price of $97,862. The company said it used proceeds from convertible notes and share sales to fund the purchase. The application software company, which has become a bitcoin proxy, has been buying tokens since 2020. In recent weeks, it has intensified its purchases as bitcoin has rallied to highs above $99,000 following Donald Trump's presidential win earlier this month. As of Sunday, MicroStrategy held a total of approximately 386,700 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate purchase price of about $21.9 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $56,761 per bitcoin.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rose on Monday as small caps rallied near new highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 400 points amid a broad sense of optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. The Dow increased 0.9% to close at a new record. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3%, despite Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. The Russell 2000 (^RUT), up 1.6%, also closed a whisker off a record high. It did notch an intraday high. Stocks kicked off a holiday-shortened week with more of the upbeat mood that lifted the gauges to weekly wins. Markets will shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and close early on Friday. Trump tapped Bessent, viewed as the "investor favorite" pick for Treasury, late Friday evening after a surprisingly drawn-out process that saw candidates' stocks seem to rise and fall by the day. Bessent's nomination has seemed to at least temporarily calm nerves over the president-elect's inflationary agenda, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dipping back under 4.3%. On the inflationary front, the Fed will get its preferred look at the picture heading into Trump's term with Wednesday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Economists expect a tick up in "core" PCE, which is closely watched by the central bank. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was in search of a milestone $100,000-per-coin level amid a near-50% surge over the past month. It was back down below $95,000 on Monday, however. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks rose on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closing at a fresh record after gaining more than 400 points, or nearly 1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also gained 0.3%, weighed by shares of Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. Meanwhile small cap stocks also rallied with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gaining as much as 2% during the session to hit record intraday highs. The index closed just shy of its all-time high record. The markets rose on Monday following President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Kamlani reports: Allurion (ALUR) launched a new program to provide patients access to compounded weight-loss drugs Monday after months of pitching its own weight-loss solution — an ingestible balloon — as an alternative for patients who may not want to use the popular injectable GLP-1 drugs. Allurion CEO Shantanu Gaur told Yahoo Finance that, like others, the company continues to see a spillover effect from the unprecedented interest in GLP-1 drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound. It's why the company is now offering copycat products at a fraction of the cost. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Tesla stock (TSLA) is down Monday following a strong recent run-up as one Wall Street bank says “animal spirits” have pushed the stock beyond any “fundamental change” at the company. Joseph Spak at UBS noted that Tesla stock has surged around 40% since the election, adding over $350 million to its market cap. While some of President-elect Donald Trump's policy proposals could favor Tesla, there are some policy negatives as well that would hurt fundamentals more than where the theoretical upside has taken the stock. “The rise in Tesla stock is mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history),” Spak wrote. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sank on Monday to $95,000 after recently jumping to record highs just a stone's throw away from $100,000. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady climb since the Donald Trump's presidential victory earlier this month. On Friday the token inched above $99,600. Year-to-date bitcoin is up about 120%. Cruise line stocks have had an impressive run this year, and there’s still more room for growth, according to Bank of America. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) have climbed more than 30% while Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is up over 80% year-to-date. Bank of America raised Norwegian's price target to $29 from $26 and kept a Neutral rating. For Carnival, the firm raised the price target to $28 from $24 and kept a Buy rating, while for Royal Caribbean, analysts raised the price target to $240 from $210 and kept a Neutral rating. “The travel industry is back,” Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora told Yahoo Finance. “It just seems like the core demographic here for cruise [lines], which is typically a bit higher income, they continue to be in a good spot from a discretionary spending perspective.” Cruise-line operators have seen a resurgence in demand as interest rebounded from the pandemic-era, when the restrictions kept fleets docked. Data from Bank of America shows that monthly cruise spending increased 8% in October on a yearly basis. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped to session lows, sinking more than 3% on Monday. The AI chip heavyweight was the worst performer among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell more than 1% while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) rose more than 1%. Nvidia's slide weighed on the Nasdaq, which briefly turned negative by 12:20 p.m. ET. Netflix (NFLX) shares also slid 3%, keeping a lid on the tech-heavy index. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) rose more than 2% on Monday to hit its highest level since November 2021. The small cap index has rallied in recent months as the Fed began its interest rate cutting cycle, fueling expectations of less expensive financing. The Russell 2000 is up more than 20% year-to-date, with much of those gains occurring since early August. Two more Wall Street strategists are projecting the bull market in US stocks will roll on in 2025. On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. "The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead," RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Title: Microsoft's Death Cross: Tech Giant Faces A Double Blow With FTC Pressure

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), the heavyweight of Big Tech, has hit a grim milestone in technical analysis: a Death Cross. With its share price slipping below key moving averages, MSFT stock has moved into bearish territory, casting doubts on its near-term prospects. Is this just a blip for the software giant, or the prelude to deeper woes? Chart created using Benzinga Pro At $418.19, MSFT stock price trails its 20-day, 50-day and even the 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). Technical indicators are sounding alarms: The 20-day SMA at $418.73, the 50-day SMA at $421.65 and the 200-day SMA at $421.81 all point to a bearish signal. The eight-day SMA at $417.37, continues to be driven by bullish sentiment over the short term, driven by buying pressure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stands at -1.11, another red flag. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 49.09 suggests that Microsoft isn't oversold yet but is heading toward bearish momentum. These technical markers paint a strongly bearish picture. Yet, buying pressure persists, indicating that investors still see potential for a turnaround—a glimmer of bullish hope amidst the gloom. Read Also: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Compounding Microsoft's technical woes is a ProPublica investigation that has raised ethical and legal concerns over the company’s federal contracting practices. As detailed in the report, Microsoft's "White House Offer"—a supposedly altruistic pledge to bolster government cybersecurity—was a calculated business maneuver. The plan involved providing free upgrades and consulting services to federal agencies, locking them into Microsoft's ecosystem. Once the "free" period ended, agencies had little choice but to continue with costly subscriptions and Azure services, effectively squeezing out competitors. This strategy not only strengthened Microsoft's grip on federal business but also invited scrutiny for potentially violating federal procurement and antitrust laws. Legal experts argue that the deal sidesteps open competition, raising concerns about its long-term implications for government reliance on a single vendor. While the technical indicators signal bearishness, the buying pressure suggests a tug-of-war between short-term skepticism and long-term optimism. Microsoft's market dominance—bolstered by its lucrative cloud business and strategic maneuvers—remains a formidable moat. However, the ethical controversies surrounding its federal contracts could dent investor confidence and invite regulatory headwinds. Microsoft's Death Cross is a wake-up call for investors. With the stock under technical pressure and the ProPublica revelations casting a shadow over its business practices, the path forward is murky. Bulls might see this as a chance to buy on weakness, banking on Microsoft's resilience. Bears, however, have a compelling case to remain cautious as the stock navigates this precarious juncture. For now, Microsoft's crossroads is a reminder that even the mightiest of tech giants are not immune to scrutiny—or the market's harsh judgment. Check It Out: Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio. In October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors. Arrived aims to continue delivering similar value across our portfolio through careful market selection, attentive property management, and thoughtful timing in sales.

The year 2024 delivered all the drama technology fans could want: AI dominance, chip wars, smart devices that were anything but, and a social media implosion that's already a case study in corporate mismanagement. From monumental wins to jaw-dropping failures, here's the definitive breakdown of the year's tech highs and lows. Also: The best Black Friday deals live now Elon Musk spent 2024 doubling down on the chaos that turned X into a punchline. Advertisers fled after baffling policy shifts, verified checkmarks became meaningless, and users abandoned ship for Bluesky and Mastodon in droves. Engagement plummeted, and what was once a cultural institution became a meme of its former self. Musk might still call it "the town square," but in 2024, X was more like the local landfill. Also: I tried replacing Twitter with Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon: Here's what I found Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate alienated employees, sparked accusations of "quiet firing," and triggered a mass exodus of talent. Workers who couldn't -- or wouldn't -- move closer to offices were forced out, and with them went years of expertise and innovation. This was the HR equivalent of smashing a robot with a sledgehammer for a company obsessed with efficiency. Quiet quitting? More like loud mismanagement. Also: 82% of leaders plan to increase flexible work options in the next two years Tesla's Cybertruck finally hit the road in 2024 -- and immediately rolled into a ditch. Recalls for defective inverters, cameras that didn't work, and windshield wipers that couldn't handle drizzle made the truck a laughingstock. Its resale value tanked, and its polarizing design still looked like a failed geometry assignment. Sure, it turns heads, but only because people can't believe it exists. Apple's Vision Pro wowed in demos and dazzled on paper, but in practice, it was a solution in search of a problem. At $3,500, it was more curiosity than game-changer, with no killer app to justify the cost. Apple fans drooled, but most consumers shrugged. A technological marvel? Yes. A must-have device? Not even close. Also: Apple to counter new Meta products with its own cheaper headset In 2024, Intel continued to drift further into irrelevance. Its "AI PCs" barely moved the needle, and the 13th and 14th Gen Core processors -- repackaged versions of last year's chips -- left consumers unimpressed. Meanwhile, Arm-based chips like Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite set new benchmarks for performance and efficiency. Intel used to lead the charge; now it's trailing behind, yelling at the clouds. Also: The fall of Intel: How gen AI helped dethrone a giant and transform computing as we know it CrowdStrike had one job: keep systems secure. Instead, it botched a software update that caused a global IT outage, affecting millions of Windows devices and denting its reputation. For a company built on trust, this colossal failure had customers second-guessing their investments. Cybersecurity giant? More like cybersecurity headache. Also: What caused the great CrowdStrike-Windows meltdown? History has the answer The Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin proved that just because you can make something "smart" doesn't mean you should. The Rabbit R1 was clunky, impractical, and destined for the junk drawer, while the Humane AI Pin overheated, lacked features, and came with a ridiculous price tag. AI wearables promised innovation but delivered irrelevance. Also: Humane Ai Pin: What went wrong and how it can be fixed (before it's too late) Sonos hit a new low with a buggy app update that frustrated customers and delayed hardware launches. Employee warnings about the rollout were ignored, leading to a $30 million fiasco, a 25% stock drop, and layoffs. For a company synonymous with high-quality sound, 2024 was a tone-deaf performance. Also: Sonos is failing and millions of devices could become e-waste - why open-source audio is our only hope 2024 was the year AI started earning its buzz. Google's rebranding of Bard to Gemini came with the release of Gemma 2 models, which gave developers powerful tools and helped Google claw its way back into the AI race. OpenAI's GPT series remained the gold standard, tackling everything from legal briefs to code fixes, while Adobe's Firefly turned non-designers into creative pros. For once, the AI hype didn't feel overblown. Also: AI isn't hitting a wall, it's just getting too smart for benchmarks, says Anthropic NVIDIA dominated 2024, selling out its Blackwell chips for 2025 before the year even ended. The company raked in $35.1 billion in quarterly revenue, a 94% jump, and pocketed $19.3 billion in profit. It also launched Fugatto, an AI tool for generating and remixing audio, and kicked Intel out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. NVIDIA didn't just win 2024; it owned it.

The year 2024 delivered all the drama technology fans could want: AI dominance, chip wars, smart devices that were anything but, and a social media implosion that's already a case study in corporate mismanagement. From monumental wins to jaw-dropping failures, here's the definitive breakdown of the year's tech highs and lows. Also: The best Black Friday deals live now Elon Musk spent 2024 doubling down on the chaos that turned X into a punchline. Advertisers fled after baffling policy shifts, verified checkmarks became meaningless, and users abandoned ship for Bluesky and Mastodon in droves. Engagement plummeted, and what was once a cultural institution became a meme of its former self. Musk might still call it "the town square," but in 2024, X was more like the local landfill. Also: I tried replacing Twitter with Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon: Here's what I found Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate alienated employees, sparked accusations of "quiet firing," and triggered a mass exodus of talent. Workers who couldn't -- or wouldn't -- move closer to offices were forced out, and with them went years of expertise and innovation. This was the HR equivalent of smashing a robot with a sledgehammer for a company obsessed with efficiency. Quiet quitting? More like loud mismanagement. Also: 82% of leaders plan to increase flexible work options in the next two years Tesla's Cybertruck finally hit the road in 2024 -- and immediately rolled into a ditch. Recalls for defective inverters, cameras that didn't work, and windshield wipers that couldn't handle drizzle made the truck a laughingstock. Its resale value tanked, and its polarizing design still looked like a failed geometry assignment. Sure, it turns heads, but only because people can't believe it exists. Apple's Vision Pro wowed in demos and dazzled on paper, but in practice, it was a solution in search of a problem. At $3,500, it was more curiosity than game-changer, with no killer app to justify the cost. Apple fans drooled, but most consumers shrugged. A technological marvel? Yes. A must-have device? Not even close. Also: Apple to counter new Meta products with its own cheaper headset In 2024, Intel continued to drift further into irrelevance. Its "AI PCs" barely moved the needle, and the 13th and 14th Gen Core processors -- repackaged versions of last year's chips -- left consumers unimpressed. Meanwhile, Arm-based chips like Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite set new benchmarks for performance and efficiency. Intel used to lead the charge; now it's trailing behind, yelling at the clouds. Also: The fall of Intel: How gen AI helped dethrone a giant and transform computing as we know it CrowdStrike had one job: keep systems secure. Instead, it botched a software update that caused a global IT outage, affecting millions of Windows devices and denting its reputation. For a company built on trust, this colossal failure had customers second-guessing their investments. Cybersecurity giant? More like cybersecurity headache. Also: What caused the great CrowdStrike-Windows meltdown? History has the answer The Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin proved that just because you can make something "smart" doesn't mean you should. The Rabbit R1 was clunky, impractical, and destined for the junk drawer, while the Humane AI Pin overheated, lacked features, and came with a ridiculous price tag. AI wearables promised innovation but delivered irrelevance. Also: Humane Ai Pin: What went wrong and how it can be fixed (before it's too late) Sonos hit a new low with a buggy app update that frustrated customers and delayed hardware launches. Employee warnings about the rollout were ignored, leading to a $30 million fiasco, a 25% stock drop, and layoffs. For a company synonymous with high-quality sound, 2024 was a tone-deaf performance. Also: Sonos is failing and millions of devices could become e-waste - why open-source audio is our only hope 2024 was the year AI started earning its buzz. Google's rebranding of Bard to Gemini came with the release of Gemma 2 models, which gave developers powerful tools and helped Google claw its way back into the AI race. OpenAI's GPT series remained the gold standard, tackling everything from legal briefs to code fixes, while Adobe's Firefly turned non-designers into creative pros. For once, the AI hype didn't feel overblown. Also: AI isn't hitting a wall, it's just getting too smart for benchmarks, says Anthropic NVIDIA dominated 2024, selling out its Blackwell chips for 2025 before the year even ended. The company raked in $35.1 billion in quarterly revenue, a 94% jump, and pocketed $19.3 billion in profit. It also launched Fugatto, an AI tool for generating and remixing audio, and kicked Intel out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. NVIDIA didn't just win 2024; it owned it. Also: Today's AI ecosystem is unsustainable for most everyone but Nvidia Open source thrived in 2024, with AI models like LLaMA 3, Falcon, and Gemma 2 empowering developers to build without barriers. Meanwhile, proprietary overreach backfired -- HashiCorp's restrictive Terraform license spawned the popular OpenTofu fork.

Title: These Are The Best Black Friday New-Vehicle Rebate And Financing Deals

Time Published: 2024-11-25T19:35:45Z
Full Content:
The full-electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck is being offered with up to $5,000 cash back and ... [+] with a free home changing unit and installation. Though it originated with fighting crowds swarming to score deep discounts on big-screen TVs and the latest must-have toys, the so-called Black Friday weekend has since become one of the best times of the year to buy a new car, with automakers kicking off their annual holiday savings events. The deals look to be especially rich and plentiful this time around, especially for those willing to take their pick of leftover cars and trucks from the 2024 model year. Many of them are carrying especially lucrative cash-back and zero-percent financing incentives from the manufacturers to help dealers winnow down their existing stock. We’re listing the best deals we could find below. Many of the richest rebate offers are on electric vehicles from the 2024 model year that remain in stock, with several automakers offering $7,500 cash back to compensate on models that do not otherwise qualify for the one-time $7,500 federal tax credit. Of note, Ford is currently offering a complimentary home charger and installation, in addition to the incentives listed below, on the F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup truck and the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV. We’re noting the vehicles offering cash rebates of $3,000 or more and/or 0.0% financing through automakers’ captive finance divisions for four-year or longer terms; several other models are likewise offering 0.0% loans, but only for three-year loan lengths. Always run the numbers when facing a choice between a cash rebate and cut-rate financing, relative to the lowest new-car loan rates from local lenders or your credit union, to see which is the better deal. Some automakers’ offers are regional in nature, usually to address local supply and demand issues. For example, we found a $10,000 cash rebate on the full-size Lincoln Navigator SUV being promoted in the Southern California area. The terms we’re quoting below are those being extended nationwide or at least in various regions as far as we can tell, and are valid through Thanksgiving weekend. Note that cut-rate financing programs are generally restricted to those having stellar credit scores and qualifying incomes. Expect local dealerships to get in the act with their own Black Friday promotions to help lure consumers already in a spending mood into their showrooms. However, expect the most generous incentives and/or deepest discounts to be limited to the slowest sellers on the lot, and especially on any remaining 2024 model-year inventory, while current models may offer less-generous deals, if at all. Note that other cash rebates or financing incentives may be available to recent college graduates, first responders, members of the military and other groups; some are offered to current brand owners or those from competing automakers; others are sometimes extended to those having qualifying trade-ins. Check contact automakers’ websites or area dealerships for details on what’s being offered locally. As always, keep in mind that cash rebates come directly from the automaker. For their part, dealers should also be willing to slash their markups to help clear their existing inventories on any of the models we’re highlighting These are often enabled with the assistance of what are often called “secret rebates” made direct to dealerships. Be sure to negotiate the transaction price separately from any cash rebate that may apply and shop around for the best bottom-line deal. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: BIG BIT THOUGHTS.

Video podcast Audio I don’t think I know any human being on the planet who doesn’t want to be rich, or tries to increase their worth their net worth etc. Doesn’t matter if you’re an investor, work for a charity, a church etc. Money and capital are critical, it is like our economic life blood. For example, maybe you should think about blood. Blood is a critical and essential. Nobody could survive or thrive without blood. Now imagine… That somebody is taking your help four-year-old child, in drawing a pint of blood from them a day. What is going to happen to the health of your kid? It will severely stunt his growth, or positively kill him. Another thing… Imagine like you’re eating only rancid food your whole life, and the theory, you’re not going to die from it, but… Ain’t nobody want to eat rancid food. Or, let us assume that you’re consuming certain foods to just keep you alive, like beans, but everyone knows that beans cause flatulence, even an ancient Roman times, and technically raw beans are toxic. Lagoons, naturally do not want to be eaten or consumed. And therefore the toxic shell membrane they create is probably to ward off predators. ￼ And we clever humans, devised of ingenious ways to boil the shit out of them, just simply make them edible and not kill us. And the truth is, if you only ate beans you would not die, but… If you want to be the most demigod of them all, obviously you’re not going to be some sort of poverty person just consuming beans for some sort of strange higher altruistic purpose? Instead, you feast on the finest the bone marrow, the finest lamb ribs, just think about the hut of Achilles, what did he eat, and feed his guests? You know how they talk about life before Jesus life after Jesus, BC and AD… I am quite certain that a similar concept will happen with Satoshi. Like before Satoshi, life BS (before Satoshi, haha sounds like BS), and life AFTER Satoshi (AS). ￼ so the issue with being a modern day human or even American is that so much of the economic policies are obfuscated from the general public. For example. When I was in Saigon, in Vietnam off the grid, I had some time to critically think about economic theory and the like, to really try to critically understand on how currency is printed, made dominant around the planet, supported by US military force etc. In fact, if you think about the whole American the US military complex, it is basically focused on pumping money into the military industry, in order to assert military dominance on the planet, so all the weaker nations will have to force to use our dollars and accept and use our dollars, And also… America being able to pile on infinite debt obligations, knowing that she never intends to pay any of it back. So if we think about that, we know about debt in context of just being a normal human being, we don’t really know and understand debt in terms of an American national policy. For example, as a human being there’s a certain point in which numbers don’t really mean anything anymore. For example, I told you that the American national debt was 900 trillion, 45 trillion, $10 trillion, $18.3 trillion, would you be able to really understand or grasp this? Of course no! We daily humans, assume that you’re making like I don’t know 40,000 60,000, $80,000 a year… Which means maybe let us say that after taxes you’re pulling in like five to $6000 a month. If this is the case, the law of large numbers; at a certain point certain numbers don’t really mean anything to us, nor are they connected to reality. For example, the average American has never seen $1 million in their checking account or their bank balance, let alone 10 million, 100 million, 1 billion, 10 billion, 100 billion etc. ￼ There is a certain point in which numbers, ones and zeros, don’t really register in our brains. I always make the joke that I’m an Asian who is really really bad at math. And even now I am. And ironically enough, out of all my friends or typical normal human beings I know, besides Elon Musk and Michael Saylor, I am like by far the most successful innovator entrepreneur and investor of all time. I know no other human in the flesh who has stacked as many bitcoins as I have, and pretty much for the most part I never had to ever or I never panic sold any of my bitcoin. Besides selling some bitcoin like three years ago to just max out my Roth IRA contribution for the year, which ultimately I guess was a good idea because that money went into microstrategy MSTR, which is growing at an alarming rate, ￼– fortunately I had the wisdom of Odysseus; covering my ears and eyes with digital beeswax. ￼ About it, in hindsight, maybe one of the most interesting things I did was quit email in the year 2017. I might check my email like every six months or so for like authentication codes to sign into random portals, but besides this, I no longer really use email as a form of communication. If I’m doing like a workshop and I need to communicate some sort of critical information, ￼ then I’ll just copy and paste a bunch of emails, linked to Google sheets or something to send out a Zoom link or something. But besides this, email is really kind of a not good form of communication. Let us consider, i’m almost starting to feel like sending emails like sending a fax in the year 2024. I actually find it 1 trillion times more better to just FaceTime people as needed, — just think about it… All these sci-fi movies in the past, when they communicate with some sort of computer or AI, how do they do it? When you’re chatting with Jarvis it is all just a voice, and then you do the 3-D hologram thing with your hands like Tony Stark. Or if you’re Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, what do you do? You talk to Jarvis naturally, when Jarvis is inside your helmet. In fact, I believe that the original Iron Man might be one of the best films of all time, I intend on watching it again. Anyways, once again, there is no exciting movie which is actually about somebody taking out a phone like an iPhone and either sending you a text message quietly, and or, sending a long tedious email? This will not make a fun movie. Anyways, as a consequence, I think the best concept is thinking about information information flows more critically, harder stronger faster. But knowing how to filter it. The first idea is Twitter and X. It might be the world‘s newest most valuable and only useful social media platform, now that Elon Musk runs the show, and I’m like 1000% Elon, it is really truly the best and only place to get critical information about financial news etc. My thought is traditional news outlets will die a slow gradual death, just like blockbuster. It’s funny, because I remember when I was in college, and I already saw my roommate Kevin ordering Netflix DVDs in the mail, which at the time I thought was very bizarre, but I knew that blockbuster was on the way out. I wanted to short blockbuster, but eventually did not because I just didn’t know how to do it, even now I’m not quite sure how to short a stock, it just seems too complicated. ERIC Semmler, one of the head honchos at semler scientific, is also on the bitcoin standard, using bitcoin yield, BTC yield as a measure of positive performance. Funny enough he also shares my name. Anyways, I listen to an interview between him and Natalie Brunel, and something was interesting was ERIC who has been in the game for a long time, the century said that shorting stocks is actually really really difficult and very rarely profitable. Rather a lot better to instead, to just go along in a positive way for a stock. And also I agree from a philosophical perspective, voting on the success of something, and voting on the success of a stocking company, to me almost morally an ethically feels superior; the reason being is that it just feels more positive and constructive. And also it might be more profitable? Investing in bitcoin is kinda good for everybody, even if you’re like kind of anti-establishment, anti-capitalism… Bitcoin is a positively good thing. Why? If you invest in bitcoin and you purchase bitcoin, and you put yourself in your family on a bitcoin standard, the upside and positivity is that You are essentially giving a middle finger to the establishment, the “man”. For example, anybody who is a non-conformist, punk rock, into rapper hip-hop culture whatever… Steve Jobs follower, etc., should be for bitcoin. Why? Because once again, it is anti-mainstream! Even now, bitcoin is pretty much mainstream now. Whenever you check any of the news channels, what is the best news all the time, all day every day? Bitcoin! It is the only interesting news which is happening on the planet, and will always be the best news of all time. In fact, my thought is ultimate new most important media people personalities etc. will be essentially people who work in TV Cinema media rappers podcast musicians bloggers vloggers thought leaders who philosophies and create content about bitcoin. First, Bitcoin is like the new iPhone. ￼ except the upside is that instead of every six months or a year or a year and a half, bitcoin is getting updated, all day, every day, every minute on the planet. So for example, with the iPhone and Apple… All these Fan boys just jerking off to Apple rumor news, waiting for the next next next next big thing to come out that will totally change and revolutionized their lives creativity etc. But, come on guys, we’re all technologists here and digital natives– don’t we already know that the solution is staring in our face, bitcoin? If you’re the type of person like you always want the newest iPhone Pro, Tesla, cyber truck, iPad Pro etc., isn’t also the same ethos be that you should always want the newest monetary technology which is bitcoin? Once again, very bizarre. Let us say you work at Apple Amazon Facebook Google Meta etc.… And your program or a software engineer, a developer, or somebody who works “tech”– is there any irrational reason you should be anti-bitcoin? No! I would say maybe the only negative downside is if you work in tech and you are a lemming. Even now Reddit is dead; if you’re still on Reddit, you’re not it. ￼ Also, maybe the issue here is that you’re kind of old enough now, and you’re kind of mildly successful, but maybe the issue here is that too much of your net worth is tied into your company dog? Just sell it guys, buy bitcoin instead, And or just buy micro strategy MSTR stock instead. It doesn’t matter if you’re being paid like $10 million a year at Apple Amazon Google Facebook, nobody actually wants to be there. Maybe besides Tim Cook? Let us consider, all of the innovators have left Apple. Jony Ive, and some people that I know who was in the head of the Apple Photos team. The only ones who have stayed at the big companies is that maybe, they’re stuck in a rut, maybe they have a mortgage to pay or something. If you do the maths a mortgage is actually insanely expensive like 10,000 or $11,000 a month? To even pour more money into a sink sink hole, which has true negative yield? A very very bad idea. It’s almost like it’s super cold outside, and you want to warm up by taking a nice hot bath. Can you turn on the bathwater, and you put up the plug, but, you kind of either leave the drain plug unplugged like halfway, or, You have it totally unplugged. So even if the water faucet is strong and the water is flowing into your tub at a quick rate, the rate in which the water goes down the drain might either be equal or lower than your input of water. So maybe the same thing with income, like inflow, or like flowing hot water. Assuming you want a nice hot tub of water, you want to drain the plug, stop the plug, stop it up 100%, and you want the hot water to rise and fill! Maybe we should think about the same thing with investing, and money leverage, Stop the water loss! We lose it when we have a mortgage on the home, and even a more pernicious thought; property taxes. Like let us say you buy that $2 million home in all cash, you’re still gonna be paying like 2500 or $2600 a month and adjust property taxes, which almost like attaching a leech to yourself which no matter what, the leech just sucks the blood out of you with no benefit to you. Now I am all for taxes, taxes are good. Yet, because I’ve just rented my whole life, property ownership home ownership even owning a single-family home seems like such a scam; you buy the lot for like $1.1 million, you add an ADU additional dwelling unit in the back for like $350,000, and then you try to flip it for like $200,000 More? Isn’t it just way easier to just buy bitcoin instead? The big reason is the cost to capital; all the headache and time to find the contractor to build the house, fix it up, renovate it, dealing with permits and all these headaches; and also your time cost to capital; so much time and headache and communication back-and-forth, is not really worth it. ￼ At this point because I’m dumb rich, to me the finances and the money aspect doesn’t really bother me, more of my concern and fear and dread is about having to deal with some sort of degenerate contractor, who buy the laws of physics and entropy will always be Late, more expensive, and will probably take one or two years longer than you expect. If you plan on doing the home thing, maybe the best idea is just approach things as if you will never hire help or a contractor? Then this way it could become more of a creative endeavor, and also, you know that you will never blame anyone else but yourself? Even like changing your own oil, the virtues of changing your own oil is pretty funny; I hate feeling ripped off, and I always feel super stupid for paying somebody else to change my oil. Even though it’s a huge pain in the butt for me to do it myself, I just have like 1 trillion times more joy and pride that I changed my own oil in my 2010 Prius, With mobile 1 full synthetic, and a K&N performance oil filter. It’s funny when I drive, I always have a huge grin and sense of pride on my face because I knew that I changed my own oil, 1 trillion more times happiness than even maybe driving a cyber truck or a Lamborghini? Nobody cares about your four bitcoin Ferrari; Once again, what I find so disruptive is that now… You will feel more joy pride and happiness to own the bitcoin, because you will always remember the number in your head in your mind, and you’ll always smile when you see the price exploding, rather than being stuck in a Diluted asset, whether does that be your yacht, Ferrari or Lamborghini. Or even your Porsche. If you really want to be happy, the optimal strategy assuming that you like own more than one car, or you don’t really need some sort of expensive performance vehicle that guzzles 91 octane gas, then I think optimal strategies to sell the extra car, and just buy bitcoin! In fact, if your goal is to actually make more money to upgrade to the next car, a funny strategy then is to just invest in bitcoin, write it up, make a shit load of money, and then just sell some of it later, to buy your next car. I’m super excited, the first time ever, I’m doing a free online open source zoom workshop, and don’t worry I will record it and post it later and share it with you because I feel like this is my new ethical imperative. I’m going to do it December 14, Saturday 10am to noon, Pacific time LA TIME. ￼ to register for the workshop to get the Zoom link, just fill out your email informed here, and before the workshop date, maybe like a day prior or so, I’ll email you with a Zoom link. FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here. Essentially my vision is I just want to do a soft introduction to bitcoin the philosophy of it etc., the first hour hour and a half will just be like introductions and my lecture, and then I will leave some time at the end for questions and answers. It might go a bit over but whatever.￼ ￼￼￼ It will be totally 100% open and free, and also open source, so feel free to send the link to your friends, your mom or your dad who doesn’t really understand bitcoin, also I am fluent in Korean and Vietnamese, and also Spanish if you have some sort of bilingual parents you want to bring along. ￼> FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here.

Monday's market has seen notable swings among stocks, with mega-cap companies like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) experiencing declines, while large-cap stocks such as Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Super Micro Compu (NASDAQ:SMCI) have surged.

Title: Bitcoin Buying Plans Are Supercharging Stocks. Is This a Michael Saylor Redux — or Another 'Long Island Iced Tea' Fad?

Time Published: 2024-11-25T17:54:48Z

What does the ragtag group including a fitness equipment maker, biopharmaceutical company and producer of battery materials have in common? Bitcoin, of course. As the cryptocurrency skyrockets to unheard-of levels this month, at least 12 publicly traded companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto announced they plan to buy bitcoin (BTC), choosing it as a modern — and, lately, quite profitable — place to park spare cash. It's a path illuminated by Michael Saylor's laser eyes since 2020, when he began converting his sleepy software maker MicroStrategy into a corporate vault for bitcoin. That's turned MicroStrategy into a massive stock market success — up roughly 30 times in value since Saylor began buying bitcoin for the company, amassing a massive stockpile now worth about $38 billion. Just this month, its shares have nearly doubled in price since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president after pledging to embrace crypto. (Other crypto stocks have jumped, too. Coinbase, the exchange operator, is up nearly 70% since the day before the election.) Others are trying to duplicate that success. On Friday, a biotech company, Anixa Biosciences (ANIX), said its board of directors approved buying an undisclosed amount of bitcoin to diversify the company's treasury reserves. The stock rallied as much as 19% but settled for a 5% advance by the end of the day. Meanwhile, on Thursday, fitness equipment company Interactive Strength (TRNR) said it plans to buy up to $5 million of bitcoin after its board approved the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. Following the announcement, its stock soared more than 80% at one point before settling for "only" a full-day gain of 11%. Earlier last week, biopharma company Hoth Therapeutics (HOTH) announced a $1 million bitcoin buying plan, triggering an up to 25% surge in its stock — though nearly the entire rally fizzled by the end of the day. Similarly, companies including LQR House (LQR), Cosmos Health (COSM), Nano Labs (NA), Gaxos (GXAI), Solidion Technology (STI) and Genius Group (GNS) saw momentary spikes in their stock prices after revealing bitcoin treasury plans in November. Only one company fell after its announcement: Acurx Pharma (ACXP). "The recent bitcoin boom, coupled with MicroStrategy's 500+% stock surge in 2024, has inspired a wave of companies — particularly microcaps — to announce bitcoin buying strategies," said Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining (BTCM). Whether these newcomers to the Saylor playbook will ever see Saylor-like benefits remains a very open question. "This behavior could end the same way [as previous bull markets]: unsustainable hype followed by sharp corrections as the market realizes many of these announcements lack substance," Yang said. And whether the recent entrants ever follow through is also technically unknown. So far, only artificial intelligence firm Genius Group is known to have actually bought any bitcoin. But who can blame them for trying? Investors who invested early in MicroStrategy are getting ridiculously rich, and even recent investors are making easy money. Saylor largely funds MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchases with money raised from stock and debt sales. The copycats might gain access to capital markets that they wouldn't otherwise have had. Traders are following the old adage, "Never fight the tape" — meaning follow the market's direction no matter the fundamentals, while companies are providing what the market wants. Nobody wants to be "that" person or company telling their bosses, shareholders or anybody else that they underperformed the market because they didn't follow MicroStrategy's footsteps. "Only a few years ago, it was almost too risky to buy bitcoin. Now, however, the risk increasingly seems to be the opposite — not buying is actually the risk," said Brian D. Evans, the CEO and founder of BDE Ventures, adding that "there’s real pain in not having exposure." To the hopefuls, this sudden corporate scramble might be a sign that mainstream bitcoin adoption is finally arriving, especially in an environment where President-elect Trump has said he wants the U.S. government to stockpile bitcoin, too. "For BTC proponents, the expectation is that a combination of macro factors such as inflation and new-found regulatory friendliness will spur further examples of the asset being placed on corporate balance sheets," Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial said in a report. Also, a bitcoin buying strategy could open up capital markets for companies, like it did for MicroStrategy and miner MARA Digital (MARA). Both were able to raise money recently through convertible debt that pays no interest to investors, meaning those investors are willing to forego current income in exchange for the ability to eventually convert the debt to equity, thus gaining bitcoin exposure. Saying they plan to buy bitcoin "is a useful way for companies to raise capital, not unlike the way MicroStrategy has done over the last few years," said BDE's Evans. However, to cynical ears, it all sounds a bit like the passing fad in the late 2010s that involved companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto adding the word "Blockchain" to their corporate name. The most famous example of this was little-known beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea renaming itself Long Blockchain, with an explosive result, at least initially: Its share price nearly tripled in a single day after the crypto-rechristening. The gains didn't stick and the stock was later delisted by Nasdaq. (And three people were accused of insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.) There have been other magic words. In the 2021 crypto bull market, big-name companies touted their Web3, metaverse and non-fungible token (NFT) initiatives — trying to hitch their shares to crypto and related hype. Facebook even changed its name to Meta to focus on the metaverse business, which subsequently faced massive losses. Meanwhile, companies with languishing share prices and no connection to crypto dipped their toes into bitcoin mining, a then extremely profitable business. The brutal bear market that followed turned crypto terminology into dirty words that few wanted to use. Though MicroStrategy has been able to raise billions from capital markets to fund bitcoin purchases, such a strategy, if pursued by others, could backfire for smaller companies, said Yang. "For microcaps, it risks being seen as a short-term gimmick, deterring serious investors. If bitcoin's price stabilizes or declines, the stocks' speculative appeal may fade, leaving these firms vulnerable to investor skepticism and regulatory scrutiny." Echoing this sentiment, David Siemer, co-founder and CEO of Wave Digital Assets, said, "While this approach may yield short-term gains in a bullish market, it carries significant risks. Unlike straightforward asset holding, leverage amplifies potential losses during market corrections, underscoring its inherent danger," he said, pointing to firms that are leveraging the hype around bitcoin to add debt to their balance sheet. Regardless of who is right, with bitcoin repeatedly smashing all-time highs after Trump's U.S. election win, magic remains in the air: Announce a Saylor-like bitcoin plan and see your stock take off. "It’s almost as though we are at a point where a lot of companies feel compelled to do this," BDE's Evans said. Welcome to the new crypto bull market.

Title: Apple deals are crashing to all-time lows for Black Friday-find them all right here

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (today – November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). There is no longer any need to wait, and we’re seeing some fantastic deals! We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Black Friday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: For more monitors for your Mac look at Best Mac monitor deals for Black Friday U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry There are Black Friday deals on many of the streamers, for example, Hulu is bundling Disney+ for a saving of 85% (just $2.99 a month). Peacock has 75% off at $1.99 month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is pay $8 a month, 50% off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-days trial, or its 3-months if you buy an Apple product. There are even some Black Friday deals: As for Apple’s set-top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it. See our round-up of the Best Apple TV deals. U.S. U.K. In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on the any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad! Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29 in 2024) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks. You can get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Here’s how it compares to last year and the year before. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals: Check out these time-limited tech deals before they go.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks climbed on Monday amid high hopes for President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. Investors also looked ahead to a Federal Reserve-favored inflation print. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the advance, up about 250 points, or roughly 0.6%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.6%, while those the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up almost 0.7%. Stocks are kicking off a holiday-shortened week with more of the upbeat mood that lifted the gauges to weekly wins. Markets will shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and close early on Friday. The Dow closed last week at a record high, gaining almost 2% on the week. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were both up over 1.5% as they crept closer toward the initial levels seen after the election. Trump tapped Bessent, viewed as the "investor favorite" pick for Treasury, late Friday evening after a surprisingly drawn-out process that saw candidates' stock seem to rise and fall by the day. Bessent's nomination has seemed to at least temporarily calm nerves over the president-elect's inflationary agenda, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dipping back to 4.36%. On the inflationary front, the Fed will get its preferred look at the picture heading into Trump's term with Wednesday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Economists expect a tick up in "core" PCE, which is closely watched by the central bank. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was in search of a milestone $100,000-per-coin level amid a near-50% surge over the past month. It was hovering around the $98,000 mark early Monday.

Title: Elon Musk has big return-to-office plans for federal employees and he’s saying the quiet part out loud

Good morning! The return-to-office debate got a bit spicier last week with Elon Musk’s latest promise to make the government more efficient. In an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, the billionaire appointed to head up the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) along with his co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy, laid out plans to reduce the overall size of the government and cut costs. And one part of that blueprint included mandating a full return-to-office for all Federal workers. “Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the COVID-era privilege of staying home,” they wrote. In doing so, Musk and Ramaswamy seem to be openly announcing what some critics have long argued is a disguised impetus behind strict RTO mandates: Job cuts. One survey this year of more than 1,500 U.S. managers found that a quarter of C-suite executives were hoping that return-to-office policies would encourage employees to voluntarily quit. After all, it’s certainly cheaper than having to do layoffs and pay severance. Other CEOs have discussed potential attrition due to five-day RTO mandates. Last month, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told staffers during an all-hands meeting that it’s “OK” if people don’t want to work in an office environment because there are “other companies around.” That led many employees to sign an open letter to corporate leadership noting his remarks were “inconsistent with the experiences of many employees” and “misrepresenting the realities of working at Amazon.” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pushed back against allegations that the company’s RTO requirement was an excuse to lay off workers and said the decision was “not a cost play.” The Federal government is the nation’s largest employer, with over 2.2 million civilian staffers. Until now, each agency has been able to decide what workplace policy works best for them. Of the total number of Federal workers, roughly half work on-site, according to an August report from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. While remaining employees are eligible for remote work, the report found that only 228,000, or roughly 10%, were in remote positions where there was no expectation that they work in-person. And those who have the option to work remotely spent about 60% of working hours in-person at various job sites. It’s unclear if Musk and Ramaswamy will actually be able to implement a five-day RTO for Federal workers. And of course, the question remains: Will these CEOs return to the office themselves? That’s yet to be seen. Brit Morsebrit.morse@fortune.com Today’s edition was curated by Emma Burleigh. A round-up of the most important HR headlines.

Title: Will Trump’s DOJ Dismantle Big Tech Monopolies?

The Big Tech Titans: Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft face mounting scrutiny as the Trump ... [+] administration's antitrust agenda targets industry monopolies and reshapes the future of technology. November 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its proposed final judgment, recommending sweeping remedies to dismantle Google’s search monopoly. This long-awaited action marks the most significant antitrust move in decades and could become a pivotal moment for Big Tech as President Trump prepares for his second term. At the core of the DOJ’s plan is the requirement for Google to sell its Chrome browser. The proposal also includes a framework for divesting Android if behavioral remedies fail to increase competition. Remedies include banning exclusive default agreements with device makers and prohibiting Google from developing new browsers. Unsurprisingly, Google is pushing back strongly and Google’s chief legal officer Kent Walker called the DOJ’s plan a “radical interventionist agenda,” asserting it goes “miles beyond” the concerns outlined by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled in August that Google held monopolies in two markets. With President Trump back in the White House in January, speculation is mounting over whether his administration will pursue even more drastic actions against Big Tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Apple. Such moves could reshape not only the tech industry but also the global economy. The incoming Trump administration has long signaled an aggressive stance on Big Tech, citing concerns about censorship, market dominance and monopolistic practices. High-profile figures in Trump’s circle, such as former Congressman Matt Gaetz and Vice President J.D. Vance, have long been critics of tech monopolies. Gaetz has focused on perceived censorship of conservative voices, while Vance has called for reforms to rein in monopolistic practices. Pam Bondi, Trump’s new nominee for attorney general, could play a key role in this agenda. Bondi has a notable record of consumer protection and antitrust enforcement, having recovered over $1 billion in such matters as Florida’s attorney general. However, her direct involvement with Big Tech enforcement has been limited. Bondi’s public support for former President Trump’s lawsuit against Facebook, Twitter and Google in 2021 suggests a willingness to challenge Big Tech’s influence but leaves questions about her approach to structural remedies. This momentum aligns with rare bipartisan support, highlighted by the latest action from the DOJ under President Biden. Influential Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have also advocated breaking up Big Tech, arguing that monopolies stifle innovation and harm small businesses. With mounting pressure from both sides of the aisle, Big Tech now faces an unprecedented challenge. The U.S. is not alone in scrutinizing Big Tech. Across the Atlantic, European regulators, led by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, have ramped up investigations. Proposed remedies, such as forcing Google to divest its ad tech business, reflect a global trend toward stricter oversight. European lawmakers like Andreas Schwab advocate robust measures to ensure fair competition and foster innovation. These efforts could inspire similar actions in other jurisdictions, further pressuring U.S.-based tech giants. A breakup of major tech firms could echo past antitrust actions, such as the breakup of AT&T’s Bell System in the 1980s or the case against Microsoft in the 1990s. Here’s a closer look at the likely targets: A breakup of Big Tech could have profound implications for innovation. Large tech companies have been instrumental in advancing cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and sustainable energy solutions. For instance, Microsoft and Amazon have explored nuclear power options to meet the energy demands of AI data centers. Disrupting these corporate giants could slow progress in areas like AI development and power generation, particularly as hyperscalers have the resources to invest in ambitious, long-term projects. However, breaking up Big Tech might also create opportunities for smaller, more agile companies to step up. A less concentrated market could foster competition, enabling a diverse range of businesses to tackle these challenges. This democratization of innovation could lead to creative solutions that were previously overshadowed by Big Tech’s dominance. While the transition could bring short-term disruption, it may ultimately stimulate a more competitive technological landscape. A breakup of Big Tech would create seismic shifts in the industry, presenting both opportunities and challenges: While a breakup is not guaranteed, the bipartisan appetite for antitrust reform and the Trump administration’s rhetoric suggest significant changes are possible. A dismantling of Big Tech could redefine how technology is developed, consumed and regulated in the U.S. and beyond. The stakes are enormous. As the tech industry braces for potential upheaval, businesses, policymakers and consumers must prepare for a future that could look radically different. Whether this transformation fosters a more competitive marketplace—or introduces new challenges—remains to be seen. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: What Wall Street Analysts Think of Dell's Stock Ahead of Earnings

Time Published: 2024-11-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Dell (DELL) is set to report third-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday, with analysts anticipating sales and profit gains from the year prior, but little further appreciation for the stock. Of the 10 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha, eight have a "buy" or equivalent rating, compared to two "hold" ratings. However, their consensus price target of $145 would imply less than 1% upside from Friday's closing price. Wall Street expects Dell to report third-quarter revenue of $24.68 billion, an 11% rise year-over-year, and net income of $1.02 billion or $1.42 per share, up from $1 billion or $1.36 per share a year ago. Morgan Stanley analysts told clients in a note Thursday they “don’t expect much upside” from Dell’s third-quarter earnings, but suggested the company could see more growth in 2025 from artificial intelligence (AI) servers. Dell makes servers that utilize Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, drawing a shoutout from the chipmaker in its earnings call Wednesday. For now, results could be hindered by “sub-seasonal PC market trends” and “flattish” quarter-over-quarter AI server growth, the analysts said. Morgan Stanley holds an “overweight” rating and $154 price target for Dell. Dell shares have gained nearly 90% since the start of the year, at $144.21 as of Friday's close.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Trending on Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media. The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

On November 21, Phillip Securities downgraded the stock to Accumulate from Buy with a price target of $160, up from $155, following the Q3 report. The advisory cites the recent movement in the shares for the downgrade. It also lowered margin assumptions for fiscal 2026 to reflect management guidance of lower margins due to Blackwell products. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are trending on financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand. Today, Millennium has over $70 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. Investors should understand that Millennium is a "pod shop," which means it allocates capital to different teams (or "pods") that all have their own strategies and a lot of autonomy. In the third quarter, Millennium sold large portions of its stakes in artificial intelligence (AI) companies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and bought a new stock that Wall Street thinks can soar. Broadcom isn't the only way to tap the AI revolution. There are currently eight publicly traded companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer and the largest company in the world by revenue, has quietly blown away the rest of the retail sector in recent years as its commitment to omnichannel sales and reputation for everyday low prices have delivered steady growth. Walmart reported another round of strong quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Microsoft and Broadcom are more stable long-term AI plays. Markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. Earnings from retailers and October inflation data will be the week's highlights. On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful. The phrase "economic moat" -- popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett -- refers to certain types of durable competitive advantages a company can possess that make it difficult for potential rivals to make inroads against it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. Shares pulled back slightly on the news as investors have gotten accustomed to the chip titan regularly besting expectations, and some analysts wanted to see stronger fourth-quarter guidance, which called for $37.5 billion in revenue -- a 70% increase from the quarter a year ago. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is now worth $3.5 trillion. One FAANG stock was unceremoniously left out of the "Magnificent Seven." That was a costly blunder. The party may come to an abrupt end for Wall Street. Sign in to access your portfolio

Two missions launched in less than 24 hours from two pads in two different hemispheres, setting a new company record for fastest launch turnaround. MAHIA, New Zealand--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (Rocket Lab or the Company), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 56th Electron mission, deploying five satellites to Low Earth Orbit for French Internet-of-Things (IoT) constellation operator KinÃ©is. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241124966388/en/ Rocket Lab's Electron rocket lifts off the pad at Launch Complex 1 to deploy satellites to orbit for French constellation operator KinÃ©is. The launch was the company's second in less than 24 hours. Image credit: Rocket Lab and Rory Gannaway The Ice AIS Baby mission lifted-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 4:55 pm on 25 November NZDT (03:55 UTC), successfully deploying five satellites to a 643 km low Earth orbit. The mission was Rocket Lab's 14th mission of 2024 and 56th launch overall.

Title: Examining Nancy Pelocy's Selling on Google and More

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary. But the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments. Nancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023. The timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit. Well, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices. And now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s. As this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions. Nancy Pelosi as Investment Guru? Let's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024. Maybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer. Gurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list. Her most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price. On the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece. If our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption. And after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July. And look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price! Meanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025. Looking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies. Unlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too. But other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way. What do you think?

In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary. But the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments. Nancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023. The timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit. Well, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices. And now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s. As this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions. Nancy Pelosi as Investment Guru? Let's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024. Maybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer. Gurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list. Her most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price. On the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece.
