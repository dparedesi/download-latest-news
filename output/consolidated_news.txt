As a content marketer, I regularly use AI SEO software to analyze data faster, optimize content, and achieve higher rankings. But with so many tools making bold claims, it's hard to separate the genuinely useful from the overhyped. That's why I‚Äôve tested dozens of AI SEO tools myself and narrowed them down to the 8 that actually deliver results. Here's my detailed review of each. Spoiler alert: here are my favorite AI tools for SEO: 1. ContentShake AI for generating SEO-friendly content 2. Semrush Copilot for personalized SEO recommendations 3. Clearscope for SEO content optimization 4. SurferSEO for advanced SEO content creation 5. ChatGPT for brainstorming and data analysis 6. Copy.ai for automating your SEO workflows 7. SERP Gap Analyzer for finding keyword opportunities 8. Perplexity for conducting online content research Let‚Äôs look at each of them in detail. Semrush Content Toolkit is the smart writing tool we've developed at Semrush. It combines AI with our proprietary SEO data to help you create entire articles, find content ideas, and write in your unique brand voice. I recommend using this tool for creating SEO-friendly drafts, especially if you‚Äôre not an SEO expert. I love that it finds your target keywords and analyzes SERPs so that it can optimize your content for search intent‚Äîsomething SEO beginners usually struggle with. Let‚Äôs look at a sample workflow. First, enter a high-level content idea and get dozens of data-driven keyword and topic suggestions. Next, click ‚ÄòStart writing‚Äô and choose whether you want to create an SEO content brief or generate a full blog post from scratch. This will open the setup window, where you can adjust your target keywords, content length, and brand voice. Check the ‚ÄòAdd an extra SEO boost‚Äô box for advanced SERP analysis and click ‚ÄòCreate article‚Äô. In just a few minutes, your draft will be ready. You can then use the blog editor to add more original ideas and further enhance your content. Content Toolkit also includes an integrated AI chat, an AI image generator, and a content optimization tool to improve your copy. Pros Cons Very easy to use‚Äîideal for beginners with little SEO experience Less suited to large teams and enterprise users Uses Semrush‚Äôs data to optimize AI-generated content Some stock images suggested by the tool may not always be relevant Covers the entire content creation cycle, from ideation to publishing Semrush Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that offers personalized recommendations based on your SEO performance. Copilot analyzes all of your Semrush data from tools like Site Audit, Backlink Gap, and Keyword Gap.. It then consolidates the issues and action items into tailored recommendation cards, related to your keyword rankings, domain authority, organic competitors, and more. I use it to regularly check SEO recommendations and spot potential issues, such as with technical SEO or backlinks. When I see a recommendation or alert, I head to each specific tool to investigate it further: Pros Cons Makes it easy to prioritize action items for SEO performance Exclusive to Semrush users: not compatible with other tools Helps navigate the many tools in Semrush‚Äôs suite While the reports provide a lot of useful data, some users may want more in-depth summaries Offers daily alerts to keep you posted about real-time concerns Converts data into actionable insights in order of priority Clearscope is an AI content platform that helps with keyword research, content optimization, and analytics. The content optimization feature offers somewhat similar benefits to other AI content tools. But the workflow is different. When you add an existing URL and your target keyword, the tool will analyze the published page for you. It will then provide suggestions for improvement, such as: The tool also helps with topic research and generates basic SEO reports. For example, it tracks your ranking positions and provides high-level content analytics metrics. Pros Cons Automates the process of building content briefs and optimizing content More expensive than most SEO content creation tools and has no free trial Keep tabs on published content to find opportunities to refresh content Doesn‚Äôt offer many content creation possibilities Provides content analytics, which simplifies performance analysis Content analytics and keyword research tools are somewhat basic, and the content grade simply checks if you‚Äôve covered all related keywords SurferSEO offers a suite of SEO tools to discover keywords, find content ideas, create outlines, optimize content, and more. Many content teams use it for content optimization. Similar to Clearscope, it analyzes the organic results for your target keywords and makes content structure recommendations. Surfer also offers some useful features for search engine optimizers, including a topical map, an SERP analyzer, and a content audit tool. A word of caution: I‚Äôd be careful with metrics like optimal content length and the recommended number of headings. While they might be useful suggestions, you‚Äôll know best if they make sense for your particular content piece. Finally, while you can generate full articles, they each cost an additional $19, with a maximum of 30 articles on the cheapest plan. Pros Cons Easy to use when working with content writers, as it helps to track keywords in your drafts Might not be the best choice for beginners and folks looking for more automation as it involves more steps and requires more SEO experience Sleek and modern UI Limited credits make it difficult to use freely The Google Docs extension makes it easy to work anywhere The Google Docs extension can get a bit buggy Lots of data-driven tools useful for SEOs and content marketers The Content Editor doesn‚Äôt let you adjust your targets üí° Find out who comes out on top in our ContentShake AI vs SurferSEO comparison. In the screenshot above, ChatGPT claims it can do a variety of SEO tasks. But I would take this with a pinch of salt. ChatGPT, along with other AI chatbots like Gemini and Claude, is amazing for brainstorming and analysis. But it doesn‚Äôt have any real-time SEO data and is not adapted for long-form content creation. So, I‚Äôd only use it together with an actual SEO tool that has access to SERP data. That said, ChatGPT is useful for other SEO tasks such as: Let‚Äôs look at an example. I downloaded a list of keywords from Semrush, uploaded the CSV file to ChatGPT, and asked it to group my keywords by category: Here‚Äôs the result: This is just one of many examples of how ChatGPT can save you time with SEO tasks‚Äîas long as you already have the data you need. Pros Cons Powerful AI with integrated data analysis features Doesn't offer real-time SEO data and specialized SEO output ChatGPT's best model (ChatGPT 4-o) is free for all users The interface is not optimized for long-form content creation Beginner-friendly interface and affordable price point Prone to factual errors and inaccurate responses üí° Check out how ChatGPT compares to ContentShake AI. Copy.ai is an AI-powered automation platform with content creation tools for sales and marketing needs. Like other AI writing tools, it was originally used primarily for content creation. But it has recently shifted its focus towards automation. Copy.ai's new standout feature is its ability to create multi-step workflows for SEO processes. You can use the library of workflow templates for different use cases, such as writing a blog post, an SEO brief, and so on. The tool also lets you design custom workflows to automate different parts of your SEO setup. Here‚Äôs what it looks like: Pros Cons The unique workflow creation feature works great for enterprise SEO teams and large agencies with lots of processes It‚Äôs somewhat hard to use and might take a while to figure out Offers a sleek and modern UI Doesn‚Äôt offer any SEO data Integrates with 2,000+ tools SERP Gap Analyzer helps you discover low-difficulty keywords for your content plan. You can use it to find relevant keywords with higher search volume and less competition. This is especially helpful if you‚Äôre in a saturated niche and have to compete with lots of high-authority websites. Just enter your site and a seed topic to run an analysis. The tool then analyzes the search results for multiple relevant keywords and displays the ranking difficulty for each keyword. You can access other insights such as global search volume, SERP weaknesses, and more. Pros Cons Solves one of the key SEO pains‚Äîfinding high-potential content topics Doesn‚Äôt integrate with most other SEO tools, except Semrush Generates briefs, outlines, and other content Can be a bit confusing to figure out Documents SERP analysis in detail to guide SEO efforts Perplexity is a conversational AI tool that‚Äôs connected to the Internet. It lets you parse the web, find information quickly, and conduct deep web research. Wondering why I included this tool in a list of SEO software? Because effective SEO is closely connected to quality content. And quality content needs fresh information and useful examples. I often use Perplexity to find out in minutes what could otherwise take hours of scouring web sources. For example: imagine I need to find an example of a content marketing campaign for small businesses for an article I‚Äôm writing. Perplexity will use various online sources and instantly suggest interesting ideas: Pros Cons Conducts image and video search There‚Äôs a limited number of questions that you can ask in a day on the free plan Organizes research with collections of multiple threads Limited to research and doesn‚Äôt serve very well for content creation Performs focused research on specific sites, such as YouTube, Reddit, etc. Sometimes hallucinates AI SEO tools use artificial intelligence to automate and fast-track SEO processes, such as keyword research, SERP analysis, and content creation. They can help you make better data-based decisions, increase productivity, and save time on routine tasks. Earlier this year, I surveyed over 2,500 small businesses and asked them about their experience with AI. And guess what? 68% of companies report higher SEO and content marketing ROI when using AI. There has been a lot of talk lately about Google ‚Äúpenalizing‚Äù AI-generated content. Let‚Äôs get this sorted once and for all. Google doesn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs AI copy or not. It cares only about your content being genuine, useful, and relevant. Here‚Äôs what else they say: ‚ÄúPoor quality content isn't a new challenge for Google Search to deal with. We've been tackling poor quality content created both by humans and automation for years.‚Äù We‚Äôve further proven that AI-generated content ranks nearly as well as human-written copy‚Äîas long as it offers value and original insights. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend relying solely on AI to create content for SEO and content creation. Why? Because AI doesn‚Äôt have the unique topical expertise that you need to create compelling content. But using AI as a tool to create content under your supervision and with your input? Or leveraging it to generate content ideas, cluster keywords, and analyze SEO data? Why not! That‚Äôs a wrap on my weeks of testing and shortlisting my favorite AI SEO tools. The key takeaway? Choose a tool that suits your specific needs and context. For example: Remember: there‚Äôs a limit to what AI tools can do. Use them to get rid of routine tasks, and to support your work, not replace it, and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Margarita Loktionova Keyword search volume is the average number of monthly searches for a search term in a particular location.

Title: Time To Buy Adobe Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), a global frontrunner in creative software and digital experiences, has consistently achieved strong financial outcomes over the years due to innovation-driven growth. However, the stock's performance during the past five years has been lackluster, as it is presently at almost the same level it occupied in May 2020! Although some investors may see its valuation as moderate or even somewhat expensive relative to the broader market, Adobe's operational performance, profitability, and financial health provide a more compelling narrative. We examine Adobe's valuation, growth, profitability, financial stability, and resilience during economic downturns to aid investors in determining whether it‚Äôs time to buy or exercise caution with the ADBE stock. At first glance, Adobe may seem slightly overvalued in comparison to broader market metrics. Its valuation multiples‚Äîbased on the current stock price and most recent financials filed on March 26‚Äîsuggest a neutral stance. While it is not trading at a notable discount, Adobe is not overvalued enough to discourage long-term investors, especially when viewed through the perspective of its solid balance sheet and earnings growth. Notably, Adobe's price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios of 7.3 times and 23.8 times demonstrate confidence in its future, even if they are somewhat higher than market averages. Investors paying a premium now are doing so for a company that has traditionally delivered double-digit growth, high margins, and consistent innovation. We see a potential upside of over 30% based on our analysis of Adobe's valuation. Adobe's revenue performance has been especially noteworthy. Over the last three years, Adobe has increased its revenue at an average annual rate of 10.9%. In the previous twelve months alone, revenues surged 10.5%, rising from $20 billion to $22 billion. The company‚Äôs most recent quarter also revealed a 10.3% year-over-year revenue increase, jumping from $5.2 billion to $5.7 billion. These statistics confirm Adobe's capability to maintain its leadership in creative and digital tools while diversifying into new growth areas such as artificial intelligence. Profitability is another key highlight. Adobe reported $8.0 billion in operating income, with a strong 36.3% operating margin. Operating cash flow was even more robust at $9.4 billion, resulting in a 42.5% cash flow margin. Meanwhile, net income reached $6.8 billion, resulting in a 30.6% net margin. These figures illustrate Adobe's remarkable efficiency and its skill in converting revenues into genuine, scalable earnings ‚Äî qualities that are highly valued in uncertain markets. Adobe's balance sheet highlights its operational discipline. The company possesses $6.6 billion in debt compared to a market capitalization of $182 billion, resulting in a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of less than 4.0%. Even more impressive is its liquidity: Adobe has $7.4 billion in cash and equivalents, which makes up 24.8% of its $30 billion in total assets. This strong financial foundation affords the flexibility to invest in R&D, pursue strategic acquisitions, and endure economic challenges. With substantial free cash flow and minimal debt, Adobe is well-positioned to manage competitive pressures and economic uncertainties. Its solid capital structure allows it to consistently return value to shareholders, whether via share buybacks or reinvestment in future growth initiatives. Although Adobe excels in most financial metrics, its history during economic downturns reveals some weaknesses. During the 2022 inflation shock, Adobe‚Äôs stock plummeted 60.0%, from a peak of $688 (Nov 2021) to $275 (Sept 2022) ‚Äî a considerably sharper decline than the 25.4% decrease in the S&P 500. The stock has yet to reclaim its previous high, reaching a maximum of $634.76 (Feb 2024) before settling at current levels. In past crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Adobe experienced a 25.6% drop, swiftly bouncing back to its pre-crisis high within months. During the 2008 financial crisis, Adobe fell by 66.7% and took approximately five years to fully recover. These trends demonstrate that while Adobe can rebound strongly, it is not immune to significant declines during global shocks ‚Äî an important factor for more risk-averse investors. Despite its volatility during downturns, Adobe's overall performance continues to be extremely appealing. Its remarkable growth rate, profitability, and robust financials make a compelling argument for long-term investment. While the valuation is not a screaming deal, it reflects a business that consistently provides value and innovation at scale. For investors willing to adopt a long-term perspective, Adobe presents a high-quality growth opportunity with established leadership in the creative and digital software sector. Those who are able to handle short-term volatility might find the current levels to be an attractive entry point for a company likely to gain from ongoing digital transformation, AI integration, and enterprise software demand. That being said, investing in a single stock like Adobe carries inherent risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, composed of 30 stocks, has a history of substantially outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a less turbulent experience, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Forget tariffs: These are the next fronts in the trade war

Time Published: 2025-05-22T09:00:00Z

The U.S. and China have stepped back from tariff brinkmanship for now ‚Äî but don‚Äôt mistake handshakes for harmony. The real trade fight is just beginning, and it‚Äôs moving into murkier terrain: microchips, AI infrastructure, and data sovereignty. And neither side is going to back down from the fierce contest over who controls the future of technology. While tariffs still loom large, both sides have agreed to a temporary ceasefire and a framework to bring sky-high levies back down to earth. But the next front in the trade war isn‚Äôt about crates of soybeans or textile factories. It‚Äôs about who owns the rails of tomorrow‚Äôs digital economy ‚Äî and who gets boxed out. The U.S. and China have been circling ‚Äî and increasingly clashing over ‚Äî critical AI technologies for roughly a decade. Washington has heightened controls on semiconductor exports, limiting China‚Äôs access to advanced AI chips and pressuring allies to follow suit. Beijing is doubling down on self-reliance, retaliating with restrictions on critical minerals and squeezing the parts of the supply chain it still dominates. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of issues [the trade framework] doesn‚Äôt address,‚Äù Susan Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, said in an interview. ‚ÄúThe tech tensions are going to be a very high priority.‚Äù The Trump administration recently rolled back the Biden-era AI diffusion rule, which regulated global distribution of advanced AI technology ‚Äî a move praised by top CEOs that has cracked open a lucrative market for U.S. tech giants. Now, companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) are cleared to ship millions of high-performance GPUs to countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, supercharging those nations‚Äô ambitions to become regional AI powerhouses. The moves into the Middle East contrast starkly with Washington‚Äôs approach toward China. Since 2022, the U.S. has been methodically severing Beijing‚Äôs access to the most advanced semiconductors and the tools needed to manufacture them, targeting the building blocks of AI and next-gen military systems. Those export controls, first implemented under President Joe Biden, have continued to varying degrees in President Donald Trump‚Äôs second administration. Now, the scope of restrictions is poised to widen. Policymakers in Washington are weighing measures that go beyond simply blocking hardware sales and moving into the realm of research and collaboration. That includes monitoring cloud infrastructure partnerships, joint academic projects, and potential third-country workarounds. China isn‚Äôt swinging back with blunt instruments like tariffs. It‚Äôs opting for precision hits. Late last year, Beijing imposed export controls on critical minerals such as gallium and germanium ‚Äî both vital for chipmaking and EV production. And behind the scenes, China is pouring billions into building its tech lifeboat. The country‚Äôs top chipmakers ‚Äî such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) ‚Äî are quietly expanding capacity, even under the weight of U.S. export controls. China‚Äôs leadership knows that even if the country can‚Äôt leapfrog the U.S. in the near term, it can at least build a parallel tech ecosystem ‚Äî one resilient enough to survive sanctions, export bans, or a full-scale decoupling. No two companies better illustrate the stakes and asymmetries than China‚Äôs Huawei and America‚Äôs Nvidia. Huawei has become the face of China‚Äôs tech ambitions ‚Äî and of U.S. attempts to stifle them. Last week, the Commerce Department warned that Huawei‚Äôs Ascend chips are subject to sweeping export controls. Then, China warned Tuesday that the move ‚Äúseriously undermined the consensus‚Äù that the two countries reached when they agreed to pause tariffs, suggesting China might retaliate. Huawei, long seen as the face of China‚Äôs tech rise, was hit hard by U.S. sanctions in 2019. But, denied access to U.S. chips and software, the company didn‚Äôt fold ‚Äî it pivoted. It partnered with SMIC to develop chips for its Mate 60 Pro smartphones and is now pushing its Ascend AI chips as homegrown alternatives to Nvidia‚Äôs. Huawei‚Äôs chips aren‚Äôt on par with Nvidia‚Äôs, but they‚Äôre part of Beijing‚Äôs ‚Äútech independence‚Äù push. Meanwhile, Nvidia, whose high-end GPUs power almost every leading AI model, has become a geopolitical linchpin. The U.S. has repeatedly restricted its ability to sell to China, citing military concerns. Now, Nvidia walks a tightrope: maintaining global dominance while complying with U.S. restrictions. How Washington treats Nvidia is a window into the Trump administration‚Äôs broader strategy. The U.S. wants to preserve Nvidia‚Äôs status without letting China piggyback on it. Huawei and Nvidia are mirrored chess pieces in this larger game. The chip war is about hardware, but the software battle is just as critical. The U.S. leads in large foundation models, with OpenAI, Anthropic, and others training massive models on U.S.-based infrastructure. These are tightly controlled via APIs and export rules ‚Äî a ‚Äúcontrolled openness‚Äù approach designed to balance innovation with national security. OpenAI is the crown jewel of the U.S. AI stack ‚Äî not just because it makes ChatGPT, but because it helped kick off an AI arms race in which the rest of the world is scrambling to catch up. But China is countering with open-source models, the most notable being DeepSeek, from China‚Äôs Moonshot AI, which rattled Silicon Valley earlier this year. By releasing training weights and model architecture, DeepSeek sidesteps export restrictions and helps build domestic capacity. DeepSeek and OpenAI offer a compelling contrast in how China and the U.S. are positioning themselves in the next phase of the tech war: not just around chips and hardware, but around AI capabilities, open-source strategy, and control of foundational models. When DeepSeek‚Äôs ‚ÄúR1‚Äù model dropped early this year, it stunned the market. Despite running on less powerful hardware, it achieved performance levels that were previously thought to be exclusive to U.S. firms. Nvidia stock dropped 18% in a day ‚Äî a $589 billion market cap loss ‚Äî reflecting investor fear that efficient models could reduce the demand for high-end GPUs. But what makes DeepSeek especially important is that it shows China is adapting, not just reacting. ‚ÄúIf each nation‚Äôs current trajectory holds ‚Ä¶ the battle for AI supremacy will be fought not between the United States and China, but between high-tech Chinese cities like Shenzhen and Hangzhou,‚Äù Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University, wrote recently in The New York Times. As AI becomes the backbone of national competitiveness, who owns the data ‚Äî where it‚Äôs stored, how it‚Äôs governed, and who gets to access it ‚Äî is turning into a geopolitical fault line. For the U.S., the concern is clear: Sensitive data flowing to China is a national security risk. That‚Äôs why Biden, and now Trump again, pushed forward a suite of export controls and executive orders aimed at walling off U.S. citizens‚Äô data from potential misuse abroad. The logic is that data is power, and in the AI era, leaking it is leaking leverage. But China was ahead of the curve. Since 2017, it has required all foreign firms operating in China to store data locally and undergo cybersecurity reviews. Cross-border data transfers are tightly restricted. In response, some multinationals have built parallel ‚Äúdata bunkers‚Äù in China to maintain compliance. The result: a splintered internet. Data once flowed freely across borders, but it‚Äôs now increasingly fenced in by digital walls. For global companies, navigating this minefield means balancing privacy laws, national security concerns, and market access. For countries, it‚Äôs about who trains the best models, who sets the standards ‚Äî and who stays in control. The stakes go far beyond privacy. In an age of foundation models and AI training loops, data is the new oil, and sovereignty is about control of the refinery. Both Washington and Beijing know that the side with the best data will train the best models ‚Äî and that whoever controls the pipelines controls the future. Both Washington and Beijing are playing to win. The U.S. is pressuring allies to block China‚Äôs access to advanced chipmaking tools. China, meanwhile, is financing Huawei-built telecom infrastructure in ‚ÄúOne Belt, One Road‚Äù countries (China‚Äôs global infrastructure aimed initiative at connecting Asia, Europe, and beyond), pushing Chinese data standards in international bodies, and expanding RMB-based digital payments. Caught in the middle are U.S. allies that trade heavily with China but rely on Washington for security. Some are hedging, adjusting policies without picking sides. But in a world where every cloud server and chip fab is a potential battleground, neutrality is becoming harder to maintain. This next phase of the U.S.-China economic conflict is less about what‚Äôs being traded ‚Äî and more about who gets to write the rules of the digital future. Because this isn‚Äôt just a trade war anymore. It‚Äôs a contest for the 21st century. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Ethereum staking hits record high, ETF inflows turn bullish ‚Äì Impact on market?

The return of positive ETF inflows and rise in depositing addresses for staking could pave way for a better environment of Ethereum products. Ethereum [ETH] ETFs produced a combined $64.8o million in net flows on the 20th of May 2025. This pointed to an extra religion from essential institutions and influential individuals known as ‚Äòsmart money‚Äô who seemed to be positioning themselves. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA fund led with a $45.0 million raise, while Fidelity‚Äôs FETH secured $19.8 million. Meanwhile, there were no net flow changes for Bitwise (ETHW), 21Shares (CETH), VanEck (ETHV), Invesco (QETH), Franklin (EZET), or Grayscale‚Äôs funds (ETHE and ETH). These inflows follow a period of mixed or lower flows, following the‚Äî$39.8 million outflow on the 15th of May, primarily from Grayscale and Fidelity. Source: X On the 20th of May, major institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity made significant purchases, contributing $152.9 million in inflows and $15.2 million in outflows since the 8th of May. Their actions suggest an attempt to position themselves ahead of potential price increases or key market triggers. If this trend continues, it could further solidify the bullish structure for ETH‚Äôs price soon. The sudden surge in new capital indicates a notable shift in how high-conviction investors allocate their resources. Moreover, there were now more than 225,000 depositor addresses taking part in Ethereum‚Äôs staking contract‚Äîa record high. The change climbed by 0.30% over the past week, 1.77% in the past month, and 5.76% in the previous three months. It appeared more consumers were joining the Ethereum staking feature, with steady rates starting from mid-2023. Although the market was volatile, the strong growth of staked ETH demonstrated that more people were joining the network. With the total staked ETH standing at 34,559,715, this growth highlighted rising network participation despite market volatility. As the conversation about ETH ETF staking accelerated, the rise in unique staking addresses indicated that more validators were now participating. Source: IntoTheBlock Though it did not connect to institutions, it showed that ETH was still in high demand as an asset providing high yields. Although these numbers could rise significantly more, regulatory approval was necessary for it to happen. ETH‚Äôs resilience could be key to its future price stability. BlackRock has continued to push for approval of ETH ETF staking, options, and tokenization, signaling growing investor interest in Ethereum‚Äôs products as the market recovers. The company‚Äôs discussions with the SEC Crypto Task Force could accelerate the creation of clearer cryptocurrency regulations. If ETH ETF staking is approved, large investors may shift toward Ethereum, boosting its adoption. In the long term, these developments could drive higher ETF inflows, especially as Ethereum leads efforts in tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure. However, the outcome ultimately depends on regulatory decisions and market response.

Title: Walmart says it's cutting roles to 'remove layers and complexity'

Walmart is laying off corporate staff in the US to "remove layers and complexity." The retailer will lay off 1,500 employees, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, reported that the layoffs were in the company's Arkansas headquarters and other offices. The retailer's US CEO, John Furner, and global technology chief, Suresh Kumar, announced the layoffs in a Wednesday memo to corporate staff titled "Building for the future," seen by BI. "We are reshaping some teams in our Global Tech and Walmart U.S. organizations where we have identified opportunities to remove layers and complexity, speed up decision-making, and help associates innovate rapidly," the memo wrote. It added that the technology team would be slimmed down to simplify its structure and "facilitate speed and innovation." Aside from the layoffs, Walmart will also be opening new roles that align with its business priorities and growth strategy, the memo read. Walmart is not the only company flattening its corporate structure. Big Tech companies, like Amazon, Google, and Intel, have been cutting middle managers to boost efficiency. On the retail side, Amazon said in September that it would increase the ratio of its workers to supervisors by at least 15%. The news of Walmart's layoffs comes about a week after the retailer announced in an earnings call that it would increase the prices of its products due to President Donald Trump's tariffs. Walmart said it imports a third of what it sells in the US from outside the country, such as China, Vietnam, and Mexico. Although Trump has paused his additional tariffs, Walmart's CFO said reduced tariff rates are still "too high." "Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices," CEO Doug McMillon said in the earnings call. Walmart reported a 2.5% revenue growth in its latest quarter compared to the year before, with sales of $165.60 billion. Where Big Tech secrets go public ‚Äî unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Getting access to popular weight loss drugs will be simpler and cheaper for some. Health insurer Cigna (CI+0.27%) announced a new deal for copay caps on Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%) and Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) weight loss drugs. The deal caps copays at $200 a month through employer healthcare programs. Evernorth, the health services division of The Cigna Group, announced the benefit that will make popular weight loss medications Wegovy and Zepbound more available to patients. Through direct negotiations with the medications‚Äô manufacturers, Evernorth announced that it has ensured that patients‚Äô monthly cost will not exceed $200. Cigna is listed by the National Association of Insurance Carriers as the nation‚Äôs eighth largest health insurer. The insurer touted the lower costs in a press release on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe are reimagining pharmacy benefits to reduce costs and better serve patients,‚Äù said Adam Kautzner, Pharm D, President of Evernorth Care Management and Express Scripts, in the release. Evernorth did not respond to a request from Quartz for comment. The company also highlighted other savings from the new arrangement, including savings of as much as $3,600 per year compared to buying these medications directly from manufacturers or through consumer programs. Customers will also notice a simplified and automated process for faster access. The news from Cigna comes as the FDA is cracking down on compounding pharmacies that have been offering cheaper copies of the popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Compounding pharmacies may offer compounded drugs ‚Äî which aren‚Äôt regulated by the FDA‚Äîas an alternative during times of a declared national shortage. But in a memo released on Feb 21, the FDA declared ‚Äúthat the semaglutide injection product shortage is resolved.‚Äù Starting May 22, the FDA will begin enforcing action against pharmacies still dispensing the drugs. Cigna shares were trading down just below 1% in mid-morning activity. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The ‚Çπ2,150-crore IPO is entirely a fresh issue by the company, with no offer-for-sale component. Against an offer size of about 17.71 crore shares, the IPO received bids for 11.82 crore shares, subscribing 0.67 times. The IPO will close on May 23. The price band for the offer has been pegged at ‚Çπ85-90 per share, and investors can bid for a minimum of 166 equity shares. The offer is being made through the book-building process, wherein not more than 50 per cent of the offer shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to qualified institutional buyers, not less than 15 per cent for allocation to non-institutional bidders, and up to 35 per cent of the offer to retail investors. While the quota for non-institutional investors, generally referred to as HNIs, was subscribed 1.44 times, the retail portion elicited 0.48 times subscription and the institutional quota 0.42 times. Ahead of the IPO, Belrise Industries on Tuesday garnered ‚Çπ645 crore from anchor investors. The company informed the bourses that it had allocated 71,666,665 shares at ‚Çπ90 per share to anchor investors. The investors who participated in the anchor book include foreign institutions such as BlackRock, Capital Group, M&G, and Pinebridge, and domestic institutions such as ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Nippon India MF, ValueQuest, and Bajaj Allianz Life. The proceeds from the fresh issue, to the extent of ‚Çπ1,618.13 crore, will be used for repayment or prepayment, in full or in part, of certain borrowings availed by the company, and for general corporate purposes. Belrise Industries Ltd (BIL) is an automotive component manufacturing company, offering a diverse range of safety critical systems and other engineering solutions for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and agri-vehicles. Its product portfolio includes metal chassis systems, polymer components, suspension systems, body-in-white components, and exhaust systems, among others. BIL‚Äôs products are largely agnostic to vehicle powertrain types, reflecting its ability in catering to both electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, thus positioning it favourably to adapt to the growing electric vehicle market. The company specialises in precision sheet metal pressing and fabrication (i.e., the process of joining sheet metal components to create unified structures for assembling vehicle subsystems and bodies), and had a market share of 24 per cent in the overall two-wheeler metal components segment in India as of March 31, 2024, in terms of revenue (Source: CRISIL Report). Belrise has a long-standing relationship with OEMs such as Bajaj Auto Limited, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Private Limited, Hero MotoCorp Limited, Jaguar Land Rover Limited, and Royal Enfield Motors Limited, among others.

Profit after tax for FY24 stood at ‚Çπ310.88 crore. For the nine months ended December 31, 2024, revenue from operations stood at ‚Çπ6,013.43 crore, and profit after tax stood at ‚Çπ245.47 crore.

May 21, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI), Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company‚Äôs subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company‚Äôs public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance‚Äôs guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance‚Äôs Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance‚Äôs rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST) Class Period: February 16, 2023, - February 12, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) despite claiming strong visibility into customer demand and attributing headwinds to temporary COVID-related product destocking, West Pharmaceutical was in fact experiencing significant and ongoing destocking across its high-margin High-Value Products portfolio; (ii) West Pharmaceutical‚Äôs SmartDose device, which was purportedly positioned as a high-margin growth product, was highly dilutive to West Pharmaceutical‚Äôs profit margins due to operational inefficiencies; and (iii) these margin pressures created the risk of costly restructuring activities, including West Pharmaceutical‚Äôs exit from continuous glucose monitoring (‚ÄúCGM‚Äù) contracts with long-standing customers. The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 13, 2025, West Pharmaceutical issued its 2025 revenue forecast in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, significantly below expectations. According to the complaint, West Pharmaceutical attributed the disappointing guidance in part to Contract Manufacturing headwinds, including the loss of two major CGM customers that had begun transitioning to in-house manufacturing of next-generation devices because West Pharmaceutical ‚Äúmade the decision to not participate going forward as our financial thresholds cannot be achieved.‚Äù The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that West Pharmaceutical also revealed that its SmartDose wearable injector will become margin dilutive in 2025 due to lower pricing. On this news, the price of West Pharmaceutical‚Äôs stock fell more than 38%.

The rebound is buoyed by renewed risk appetite from investors as President Trump has toned down his trade war rhetoric, seeking deals with trading partners after slapping them with sizable tariffs. Still, Bitcoin has more room to run, according to the experts‚Äîwith some industry observers predicting a $200,000 top. Others are predicting even higher jumps, whether they're expected later this year or beyond. Here‚Äôs a look at some of the massive targets that crypto experts have placed on Bitcoin lately. Adam Back, Blockstream CEO: $500,000 to $1 million this cycle Blockstream boss and Bitcoin legend Adam Back spoke to Decrypt last week, and predicted the biggest and oldest digital coin would hit $500,000 to $1 million this cycle. In an interview, the computer scientist said that the price of BTC was surprisingly low at this point after last year‚Äôs halving, considering all the institutional money involved. "I think if you get a new all-time high, it could quickly become a lot higher,‚Äù he said. Standard Chartered: $200,000 this year British bank Standard Chartered‚Äôs digital assets research team is bullish, to say the least. The bank‚Äôs Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick has repeatedly said that the virtual coin would soar this year‚Äîdespite Trump tariffs and other geopolitical factors‚Äîand is predicting a $200,000 high by the end of 2025. His reasoning? U.S.-based investors wanting a non-sovereign asset. "We expect a strategic asset reallocation away from U.S. assets to trigger the next sharp upswing in Bitcoin in the coming months," he said in April. Even more bullish is the analyst's outlook for the next few years: $500,000 per coin by the time President Trump leaves office at the start of 2029. Bernstein: $200,000 this bull run Investment firm Bernstein has also bet on Bitcoin's price hitting new highs, with analysts at the firm regularly saying that institutional money will be the main driver. The firm expects companies to snap up $330 billion in Bitcoin over the next five years. "The Bitcoin genie is out of the bottle, and it is hard to reverse this course," Bernstein analysts said last year before crypto-friendly President Trump won the U.S. election. Bernstein analysts in 2024 and this year have forecast that BTC's price will end 2025 at $200,000. Arthur Hayes: $150,000 in 2025 Billionaire entrepreneur Arthur Hayes is known for his outlandish predictions‚Äîeven once referring to long-term forecasts as "pretty shit." Still, the former BitMEX boss knows his macro and has predicted intense central bank money printing to push BTC's price to the moon. Similar to Standard Chartered, he thinks investors will want to leave American assets behind. "Bitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere," he wrote in a recent blog post, predicting a $150,000 high this year. Tim Draper: $250,000 this year Billionaire investor Tim Draper recently went as far as to say that companies that didn't hold BTC on their balance sheets were being "irresponsible." The Silicon Valley venture capital investor and founder of Draper Associates said earlier this month that by the end of 2025, he believes Bitcoin will hit $250,000, noting a "gravitational pull toward Bitcoin." BlackRock's Larry Fink: $700,000‚Ä¶ eventually BlackRock boss Larry Fink, who has massively helped institutions get involved in buying BTC with the launch of the popular iShares Bitcoin Trust, said that the coin could hit $700,000. Speaking in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the CEO of the world's largest asset manager said that if institutions like sovereign wealth funds continued to make even small allocations to the asset, the orange coin's price would rocket upwards. But the Wall Street titan did add that he wasn't promoting the cryptocurrency with his bullish bet. Brian Armstrong: Multi-millions‚Ä¶ at some point The CEO of America's biggest crypto exchange Coinbase forecast in January that Bitcoin will be worth "multiple millions‚Äù‚Äîat some point in the future. Brian Armstrong, who founded the San Francisco, California-based exchange in 2012, said that nation-state adoption would help propel the asset that high. "I think over time we'll see Bitcoin get into the multiple millions price range," he said. Still, Armstrong, whose firm has contracts with the U.S. government, added that BTC has a long way to go before rising that high.

Title: Mike Novogratz Says Weakening Dollar, Widening Deficit and America‚Äôs Deteriorating Financial Situation ‚ÄòVery Good‚Äô for Bitcoin and Crypto

The chief executive of crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital says America‚Äôs current financial situation is bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto. In a new interview with Bloomberg, Novogratz says that many factors have contributed to the rise of digital assets, including President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink‚Äôs embrace of the sector. ‚ÄúIt started with Larry Fink. When he got orange-pilled, the largest asset manager in the world said ‚Äòthis is a real asset,‚Äô at least Bitcoin, that everyone should be a part of and lots of other companies‚Ä¶ followed suit. And that was kind of round one of institutions coming in. But really it was the shift of approach from the Gary Gensler SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) to this Trump Administration which has just embraced our industry, and that freed up the animal spirit, both here and abroad.‚Äù However, Novogratz goes on to say that America‚Äôs current uncertain fiscal situation is ultimately good for the top crypto asset by market cap and the digital assets industry in general. He says the Trump administration‚Äôs failure to significantly lower the debt-to-GDP ratio has been a boon for the asset class. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a really hard position as a country‚Ä¶ We have this kind of debt, yield curves are selling off everywhere, the dollar is under pressure, and that all is very good for Bitcoin and crypto assets as well.‚Äù BTC is trading for $108,961 at time of writing, just below a new all-time high.

Title: Why Nvidia-Backed CoreWeave's Stock Popped 19% Wednesday
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/why-nvidia-backed-coreweave-stock-popped-19-percent-wednesday-11739642
Time Published: 2025-05-21T21:35:14Z
Full Content:
CoreWeave (CRWV) shares soared 19% Wednesday after the company announced an upsized $2 billion debt offering. The Nvidia (NVDA)-backed cloud computing company's offering consisted of senior notes with a 9.25% interest rate due in 2030, according to a statement, and was $500 million larger than CoreWeave initially planned. The company reportedly told CNBC that the deal was five times oversubscribed. CoreWeave said it intends to use proceeds from the offering to repay existing debt, among other corporate purposes. The news comes after CoreWeave last week posted first-quarter revenue that grew more than 400% year-over-year. It was the company's first quarterly report since its initial public offering. CoreWeave makes money by providing its clients with access to data centers, which are used to develop artificial intelligence models. The company‚Äôs data centers are equipped with highly coveted chips from Nvidia, which held a roughly 7% stake in CoreWeave as of the end of March, a filing last week showed. With Wednesday's gains, CoreWeave's stock has nearly tripled in value since the company went public in March.

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Payments get smarter. Agentic AI allows bots to make purchases securely with tokenized payments. This helps shift trust and control dynamics in ecommerce. Search gets rewritten. Brands must optimize product data for AI agents as discovery shifts from SEO to intent-driven automation. CX gets invisible. Agentic AI compresses the entire buying journey into a seamless background process. As much as agentic AI promises to make our lives easier, delegating tasks and errands is certainly not new. Even in our mobile-first, app-based reality, you can use Instacart for your groceries, Stitch Fix for your wardrobe, Uber to get driven to your next destination and countless other apps to get other people to help you get things done. Yet all of those things still involve people to fulfill your requests. Shopping, planning and nearly everything else are gaining a whole new level of automation. This comes from deeper integration and the introduction of agentic AI into even the most complex and security-critical tasks we perform. The recent developments in the payments space illustrate this well. Visa, Mastercard and PayPal have recently introduced agentic AI functionality so that software agents can swipe a ‚Äúcard‚Äù as easily as a human thumb‚Äëprinting a phone. For retail brands, the clock is ticking. Whoever serves these bots first will capture the carts they fill on behalf of their human customers. Let‚Äôs look at three ways that agentic AI is going to transform the ecommerce buying experience. First, let's discuss the biggest change that agentic AI payments introduce from a customer perspective. That‚Äôs handing over your payment information to an AI agent. Technologies such as Visa‚Äôs Intelligent Commerce and Mastercard‚Äôs Agent Pay create 16‚Äëdigit network tokens (think prepaid cards with parental controls) that an AI agent uses across the web without exposing details like credit card numbers or other PII. While some shoppers may bristle at this idea, it can be a win-win from a convenience and security standpoint. Consumers can cap a bot‚Äôs weekly ‚Äúallowance,‚Äù whether that‚Äôs total spend or on a specific list of items such as groceries. Shoppers can also review an audit trail that shows every purchase the software made. Peace of mind replaces the low‚Äëgrade anxiety that has long haunted card‚Äëon‚Äëfile commerce that doesn‚Äôt have the same types of protections. What does this mean for retailers? This shift calls for several key implementations to support a seamless process. Checkout flows must be updated to accommodate the new token format and to surface agent-level permissions such as spend ceilings and stock keeping unit (SKU) categories. Creating data loops is also essential; receipt data should be fed back instantly so agents can reconcile budgets without guesswork. At the same time, fraud strategies need to be rethought. While chargeback risks may decrease, the intolerance for even a single false decline will rise. While this may feel like a big shift for consumers, there have been small steps toward this already. Whether it‚Äôs digital wallets, saved payment sources or delegating shopping needs to less automated apps and processes, the next logical step is to allow agentic payments. Increased transparency and control make this even more compelling. The next aspect is one that is fundamentally changing the way that brands are reaching their potential and current customers. While search engine optimization has played a key role in driving awareness and even repeat purchases, the rapid growth of AI-generated search results within platforms like Perplexity, ChatGPT and even Google are changing the way customers discover products and services. With the introduction of agentic AI and AI-based shoppers, the marketing funnel will shift from a predominantly human, keyword‚Äëbased search to include a greater focus on agent intent optimization (AIO), which means feeding AI-based integrations the richest possible product attributes so they can satisfy a shopper‚Äôs request (i.e., ‚Äúvegan leather sneakers, size 9, under $120, carbon‚Äëneutral shipping‚Äù). How autonomous AI is redefining the buying journey from discovery to post-purchase. The buyer‚Äôs journey will be forever changed by this change. While people shopping for themselves will likely never go away completely, the idea that a consumer could brief a bot once and outsource time-consuming searching, browsing and shopping behaviors, particularly for the more mundane items on their list, will win many shoppers over quickly. For brands, this means that having their products show at the top of a Google search isn‚Äôt quite the prize it used to be. Instead, they need their SKU on bots‚Äô short lists to remain relevant. Retailers will need to take steps here to make sure they are as agent-optimized as they are currently search-optimized. This includes investing in product‚Äëinformation hygiene by creating exhaustive attributes, standardized taxonomy and plain‚Äëlanguage ‚Äúwhy buy‚Äù notes an agent can quote back to a shopper. They‚Äôll also need to expose their inventory and price APIs to make sure that recommendations incorporating their products stay current. Lastly, brands should focus on the details by tagging sustainability, warranty and fit‚Äëand‚Äëfeel data, as many agents will rank based on sustainability or the likelihood of returns. Related Article: Is AI Your New Shopping Buddy? Because of its highly autonomous nature, agentic commerce collapses discovery, comparison, payment and even returns into a single behind‚Äëthe‚Äëscenes flow while the consumer is able to sit back and do something else. In this scenario, consumers will come to value time over price in many cases. While some decisions may always be most influenced by price, when consumers are able to benefit from time savings and convenience, their loyalty is likely to shift to whichever merchant makes their agent‚Äôs work the easiest. Brands accustomed to the current set of security and risk mitigation standards will quickly be introduced to a whole new set of protocols. For instance, payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard are insisting on a trust fabric that verifies agents, explains decisions and supports real‚Äëtime cancellation. This is critical in a fast-paced environment. Retailers will need to rethink some of what they currently have in place and approach it with an agentic mindset. This includes publishing post‚Äëpurchase status hooks such as shipping updates, estimated arrival times and exchange labels that agents can poll without scraping customer email confirmations. Policies also need to be machine readable. Everything that typically appears in the fine print, including refund windows, warranty terms and sustainability scores, must now be agent-friendly so the agent can justify its choices and make sure decisions align with the human buyer's requirements. Transparent recourse paths are also essential. That means building dispute APIs and providing clear human override options to build the transparency that agents need to recommend your brand over countless others. Related Article: AI Transparency and Ethics: Building Customer Trust in AI Systems Steps brands should take now to accommodate autonomous AI shoppers. With all of these potential opportunities and challenges introduced with agentic AI in e-commerce, there are many potential starting points. Let‚Äôs look at a few things that retailers can do in the months ahead to prepare. Start by getting your platform ready. Determine if your current checkout platform can already accept network-issued agent tokens. If it can‚Äôt, consider what it would take to make that happen. Next, get your products ready. Audit your product catalog to understand every attribute a human shopper can quickly identify. This will help clarify how AI agents will interpret your catalog. Plan ahead to smooth the journey for both agents and customers. Map the post-purchase path to identify where an agent might get stuck today and how those blockers could be removed. Finally, stay one step ahead of potential risks. Stay current on compliance and best practices, as this is a fast-moving space. The payments industry may be subject to shifting regulations and security best practices, and providers such as Visa and Mastercard are expected to formalize trust protocols soon. Retailers that take the next step to adopt agentic AI to complete purchases while reducing or eliminating friction within the process will emerge as winners in the next race to improve the buyer‚Äôs journey. Brands that hesitate may discover that future shopping carts are filled long before they even realize a bot has already walked through the (virtual) door.

May 21, 2025 16:17 ET | Source: Navitas Semiconductor Corporation Navitas Semiconductor Corporation TORRANCE, Calif., May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Navitas Semiconductor (Nasdaq: NVTS), the industry leader in next-generation GaNFast‚Ñ¢ gallium nitride (GaN) and GeneSiC‚Ñ¢ silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors, today announced a collaboration with NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) on their next-generation 800 V HVDC architecture to support ‚ÄòKyber‚Äô rack-scale systems powering their GPUs, such as Rubin Ultra, enabled by GaNFast‚Ñ¢ and GeneSiC‚Ñ¢ power technologies. NVIDIA‚Äôs next generation of 800V DC architecture aims to establish high-efficiency, scalable power delivery for next-generation AI workloads, to ensure greater reliability, efficiency, and reduced infrastructure complexity. Today‚Äôs existing data center architecture uses traditional 54 V in-rack power distribution and is limited to a few hundred kilowatts (kW). Bulky copper busbars are required to transfer this low-voltage electricity from the rack-mounted power shelves to the compute trays. As power increases above 200 kW, this architecture runs into physical limits due to power density, copper requirements, and reduced system efficiency. Modern AI data centers require gigawatts (GW) of power for the increasing demand for AI computation. Nvidia‚Äôs approach is to directly convert the 13.8 kV AC grid power to 800 V HVDC at the data center perimeter using solid state transformers (SST) and industrial-grade rectifiers, eliminating several AC/DC and DC/DC conversion steps, maximizing efficiency and reliability. Due to the higher voltage level of 800 V HVDC, the thickness of copper wires can be reduced by up to 45%, due to I2R losses, where the same amount of power can be delivered with increased voltage and lower current. Using a traditional 54V DC system, over 200 kg of copper would be needed to power a 1MW rack, which is not sustainable for next-generation AI data centers with GW power demand. The 800V HVDC directly powers the IT racks (eliminating the need for additional AC-DC converters) and is converted by DC-DC converters to lower voltages, which will drive GPUs, such as the Rubin Ultra. Navitas is an established leader in AI data center solutions enabled by GaN and SiC technology. The high-power GaNSafe‚Ñ¢ power ICs integrate control, drive, sensing, and critical protection features, enabling unprecedented reliability and robustness. GaNSafe is the world‚Äôs safest GaN with short-circuit protection (350ns max latency), 2kV ESD protection on all pins, elimination of negative gate drive, and programmable slew rate control. All these features are controlled with 4-pins, allowing the package to be treated like a discrete GaN FET, requiring no VCC pin. Additionally, Navitas offers a family of medium voltage (80-120V) GaN devices, which have been optimized for secondary side DC-DC conversion, delivering high-speed, high efficiency, and small footprint, for AI data centers PSUs with outputs of 48V-54V. Enabled by 20 years of SiC innovation leadership, GeneSiC proprietary ‚Äòtrench-assisted planar‚Äô technology provides world-leading performance over temperature, delivering high-speed, cool-running operation for high-power, high-reliability applications. G3F SiC MOSFETs deliver high-efficiency with high-speed performance, enabling up to 25¬∞C lower case temperature, and up to 3x longer life than SiC products from other vendors. Offering the industry‚Äôs broadest voltage range ‚Äì stretching from 650 V to ultra-high voltages of 2.3 kV to 6.5 kV, the SiC technology has been implemented in multiple projects for MW energy storage and grid-tied inverters with the Department of Energy (DoE). Fig. 1. Navitas GaN and SiC technologies cover the complete power delivery from grid to the GPU. In August 2023, Navitas introduced a high-speed, high-efficiency 3.2 kW CRPS, achieving a 40% smaller size than best-in-class, legacy silicon solutions for power-hungry AI and Edge computing. This was followed by the world‚Äôs highest power density 4.5 kW CRPS, achieving a ground-breaking 137 W/in3, and an efficiency of over 97%. In November 2024, Navitas released the world‚Äôs first 8.5 kW AI data center power supply, powered by GaN and SiC that could meet 98% efficiency, complying with the Open Compute Project (OCP) and Open Rack v3 (ORv3) specifications. Additionally, Navitas created IntelliWeave, an innovative patented new digital control technique, that when combined with high-power GaNSafe and Gen 3-Fast SiC MOSFETs, enables PFC peak efficiencies to 99.3% and reduces power losses by 30% compared to existing solutions. Alongside the Computex exhibition in Taiwan, the latest release of their 12 kW PSU was presented at the Navitas ‚ÄòAI Tech Night‚Äô on 21st May. ‚ÄúWe are proud to be selected by NVIDIA to collaborate on their 800 HVDC architecture initiative. Our latest innovations in high-power GaN and SiC technologies have seen world firsts and have created new inflections into markets such as AI datacenters and electric vehicles‚Äù, said Gene Sheridan, CEO and co-founder of Navitas. ‚ÄúWith our wide portfolio range, we can support NVIDIA‚Äôs 800V HVDC infrastructure, from grid to the GPU. We appreciate that NVIDIA recognizes our technology and commitment to driving the next generation of data center power delivery.‚Äù NVIDIA‚Äôs 800V HVDC architecture will improve end-to-end power efficiency up to 5%, reduce maintenance costs by 70% (due to fewer PSU failures), and lower cooling costs by directly connecting HVDC to the IT and compute racks.

Title: Did WhatsApp really need Meta?

Time Published: 2025-05-21T18:41:02Z
Full Content:
Cofounder Brian Acton butted heads with Meta before his departure, but took the stand as part of its defense. Cofounder Brian Acton butted heads with Meta before his departure, but took the stand as part of its defense. by Lauren Feiner In its antitrust case against Meta, the US Federal Trade Commission is asking a judge to consider an alternate reality. In that world, the company never bought Instagram and WhatsApp. The two apps remained competitive with Facebook, developing features that competed for users‚Äô attention. And that competition created a thriving ecosystem of social media apps where people can connect with their friends and family. Meta has spent the past several days ‚Äî during which it‚Äôs begun lodging its case-in-chief in a Washington, DC, courthouse ‚Äî building a counternarrative. In its telling of this alternate present, Instagram and WhatsApp are shadows of what they are in our world. They lacked the resources, expertise, and vision to become robust and valuable online platforms, let alone formidable competitors. And consumers are the ones who ultimately suffered. One of Meta‚Äôs key witnesses for this defense is WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton, who was called on Tuesday to help make its case that WhatsApp users, just like Instagram ones, benefited from Meta‚Äôs acquisition. Acton was the second app founder to testify in the case, after Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom delivered mostly blistering testimony against the company a few weeks ago. Acton‚Äôs time on the stand came off less acrimonious, though both Meta and the FTC scored some key points. Acton was a striking witness for Meta to call given his high-profile departure from the company in 2017. The cofounder left $800 million in unvested restricted stock units on the table after butting heads with top Meta executives over putting ads in WhatsApp (when an FTC attorney pointed out the stock would have been worth $4 billion today, he joked, ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt say that,‚Äù but reassured himself it would only be $2 billion after taxes). The next year, he publicly advocated for people to delete Facebook in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Acton reaffirmed that he had absolutely no interest in building a feed into WhatsApp But Acton backed up some important claims Meta has been making throughout the trial. Meta has repeatedly argued that WhatsApp was unlikely to compete with Facebook in the social networking space, so it wasn‚Äôt just trying to take out a potential rival. Acton reaffirmed that he and cofounder Jan Koum had absolutely no interest in building social features like a feed into WhatsApp, or changing the company into an ad-supported business ‚Äî even if their pre-acquisition investors wished they would. While the FTC has argued that WhatsApp could have succeeded on its own or with a different parent company, Acton said he and Koum rebuffed other offers, and felt that Meta‚Äôs infrastructure helped it skip over substantial work it would have had to do otherwise. On cross-examination, however, the FTC got some important admissions from Acton. Using Meta‚Äôs infrastructure might have helped it skip some steps, but Acton testified that WhatsApp didn‚Äôt actually migrate to Meta‚Äôs data centers to ward off outages ‚Äî and WhatsApp had been highly capable of finding technical support for the app already. Instead, he said, he and Koum wanted to make sure Meta would continue operating the app even after they left. Far from being a bare-bones messaging app without Meta‚Äôs help, Acton testified that WhatsApp had already added several features before the acquisition like group messaging, video and audio messaging, and location sharing ‚Äî with plans to add even more. WhatsApp was already growing incredibly fast prior to the acquisition, doubling in size every 12 to 18 months ‚Äî that growth rate stayed pretty consistent even after Meta bought it. Acton was confident that even without Meta, WhatsApp would have grown from the more than 400 million monthly active users prior to the deal to one billion in about 18 months. This echoed testimony from Systrom that Instagram would likely still be successful without the sale. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified earlier in trial that he was surprised at how little interest WhatsApp‚Äôs founders had in building something larger than a ‚Äúlifestyle company.‚Äù But while Acton reaffirmed his disdain for an ad-supported model that could pump up revenue, he conceded that he agreed to sell to Meta without securing a firm commitment against deploying ads, and he understood Meta‚Äôs offer price was likely based partly on plans to do so. That seemed to support the idea that the founders could have been open to monetizing their product more than they let on ‚Äî potentially growing it into a rival for Meta. WhatsApp might have been an even better product ‚Äî one that flourished in more markets with stronger privacy protections ‚Äî without Meta‚Äôs stewardship, the FTC suggested. In a November 2014 email, it pointed out, a WhatsApp employee told Acton and Koum that executives at its new owner had ‚Äúsome reservation‚Äù about promoting the app in countries where Facebook Messenger was already a leader. Meta successfully pressured WhatsApp to change its privacy policy and terms of service in 2016 so that Facebook could capitalize on user data for its ads product (unless WhatsApp users opted out). And it pushed for a business version of the app, something Acton said he was ‚Äúadamantly against,‚Äù fearing it would dilute WhatsApp‚Äôs end-to-end encryption. After Acton left, the product launched.

Bitcoin price rallied to a new all-time high above $109,000 on May 21, propelled by a sudden thaw in global trade tensions and expectations of looser monetary policy. The cryptocurrency traded around $109,369 on late trading, extending a rally that lifted prices about 6% in the past week. This move follows a breakthrough above $100,000 earlier in May, as investors responded to signs that President Trump‚Äôs global tariff offensive might be easing. The immediate catalyst was a surprise 90-day ‚Äútariff truce‚Äù between the United States and China. On May 12, officials in Geneva announced a pause on new levies and sharp rollbacks of existing duties, slashing reciprocal tariffs by roughly 115 percentage points to about 10%. Global markets leaped on the news: stock futures and Asian equities jumped, and commodity prices rallied on hopes of a broad trade-war d√©tente. Bitcoin investors also took notice. Analysts note that the tariff pause removed the risk of ‚Äòsudden re‚Äëescalation‚Äô, which had been weighing on risk appetite. In other words, as the trade conflict eased, risk assets like Bitcoin rallied without the overhang of fresh tariffs. Broader macroeconomic conditions have added fuel to the crypto rally. Central banks worldwide are signaling easier policy. In the U.S., futures markets are now priced at multiple rate cuts this year, and a weaker dollar has coincided with renewed growth in global money supply. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has maintained an accommodative stance, and the Bank of Japan continues massive asset purchases, reinforcing the loose global liquidity backdrop. China‚Äôs central bank has also begun pumping cash into markets. Such ample liquidity typically lifts risk assets, and Bitcoin has benefited accordingly. At the same time, institutional investors have been pouring into crypto. Hedge funds and asset managers have funneled record sums into spot-Bitcoin ETFs and futures, betting on higher prices. Leading figures in the crypto industry have expressed firm bullish conviction. Former PayPal and Meta executive David Marcus tweeted, ‚Äúthe bull case for Bitcoin has never been stronger,‚Äù citing easier custody solutions at banks and competition from sovereign and corporate buyers. Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance, echoed this optimism. Analysts even project Bitcoin could reach around $150,000 if regulatory conditions remain favorable. Looking ahead, analysts are divided on just how far Bitcoin can climb. Some have raised year-end targets above $130,000. Jamie Coutts of Real Vision warns that the relentless expansion of fiat money means Bitcoin ‚Äúmay push‚Ä¶above $132,000‚Äù by late 2025. Even major banks have revised their models: Standard Chartered‚Äôs crypto research team recently suggested that a $120,000 second-quarter price target might be ‚Äútoo low‚Äù. On the other hand, many caution that the rally could pause or correct if global liquidity peaks or regulators tighten. Bitcoin‚Äôs price historically follows four-year ‚Äúhalving‚Äù cycles tied to new coin issuance, and some forecasters see the current monetary easing lasting through 2025. Those forces could cool Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum if central banks eventually reverse course or inflation spikes. For now, however, the rare alignment of easing trade tensions and abundant liquidity, coupled with growing institutional adoption, has set the stage for one of crypto‚Äôs strongest rallies.

Despite retail stocks weighing down the market, European stocks were little changed on Wednesday. General stocks gains limited the losses as investors reacted to changes in US taxation policies. The pan-European STOXX 600 closed slightly lower, down 0.8 per cent, as Dublin saw a marginal day of trading. Dublin While fallers outnumbered risers, the Iseq All-Share index ended the session slightly up 25.31 or 0.22 per cent from its previous close, at 11,399.48, its highest ever close. There was a mixed performance in the banking sector. Bank of Ireland rose 0.89 per cent to ‚Ç¨11.995, following on from a strong performance on Tuesday. Fellow banking stocks, Permanent TSB dropped 0.58 per cent and AIB Group fell 0.45 per cent. Defensive stocks also had a mixed day of trading. While Kerry Group added 0.67 per cent, rising to a share price of ‚Ç¨97.35, fellow dairy giant Glanbia fell 0.24 per cent. Healthcare services group Uniphar saw a 1 per cent fall in its share price. Ryanair, which rose 5 per cent after publishing financial results on Monday, saw a third consecutive rise this week adding 0.63 per cent, reaching ‚Ç¨23.85 per share. London The FTSE 100 was nearly flat with a 0.06 per cent gain, while the midcap FTSE 250 fell 0.7 per cent, as the inflation data triggered a slight wobble on the more domestically-focused index. Among blue-chips, sportswear retailer JD Sports‚Äô shares were the worst hit, dropping 10.6 per cent after it warned that President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs may force the company to hike prices in the key market. SSE fell 2.4 per cent after the renewable energy generator cut its five-year investment plans by 15 per cent. Keeping losses in check, precious metal miners gained 3 per cent as gold prices rose for a third straight session and hit a one-week high. Fresnillo gained the most in the FTSE 100 with 4.2 per cent rise. Water utility Severn Trent shares gained 2.3 per cent after it projected a doubling of adjusted earnings per share between 2025 to 2028. Europe The European benchmark shed 0.8 per cent amid declines in luxury and retail stocks. JD Sports fell 10.6 per cent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after posting a 2 per cent drop in first-quarter underlying sales and warned that higher prices in its key U.S. market could hit customer demand. LVMH, Hermes and Kering among others fell over 2 per cent after luxury group Chanel reported a 4.3 per cent drop in its comparable yearly sales. Tech shares helped to outweigh these losses, German chipmaker Infineon‚Äôs 2.3 per cent gain after it said it would work with Nvidia to develop chips for new power delivery systems inside artificial intelligence data centres provided a boost to the sector. The STOXX 600, however, has recovered from its April slump, and is trading less than 3 per cent away from its all-time highs. An index tracking defence stocks was up 0.5 per cent after Trump selected a design for the $175 billion Golden Dome missile defence shield on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley raised its view on the European banking sector to ‚Äúattractive‚Äù, citing better earnings potential from continued yield steepening. The European banks index is among the top performing sectors this year. Swiss bank Julius Baer slid 4.9 per cent after reporting a 130 million Swiss franc ($156.4 million) charge from a credit portfolio review and replacing its chief risk officer. New York In a volatile session on Wall Street, the S & P500 had slipped with Treasury yields rising in reaction to the US President Donald Trump‚Äôs proposed tax-cut law during mid afternoon trading. Boosting the Nasdaq, Google-parent Alphabet recorded a jump, while Nvidia and Meta Platforms climbed saw stocks rise slightly. Nine of the 11 S&P sub-sectors traded lower, with Healthcare being the worst hit. UnitedHealth Group saw its shares fall, following a Guardian report said the healthcare conglomerate secretly paid nursing homes thousands in bonuses to help reduce hospital transfers for ailing residents. HSBC also downgraded the stock to ‚Äúreduce‚Äù from ‚Äúhold‚Äù. In earnings, retailer Target fell after slashing its annual forecast due to a pullback in discretionary spending. Wolfspeed had lost nearly 70 per cent during mid afternoon trading following a report that the semiconductor supplier was preparing to file for bankruptcy within weeks. Despite the losses, U.S. stocks have had a solid month so far. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 17 per cent from its April lows, when Trump‚Äôs reciprocal tariffs roiled global markets. On the back of bitcoin recording a fresh all-time high of $109,481.83 (‚Ç¨96,460.61) during the session, exchange operator Coinbase gained alongside crypto miners such as Riot Platforms. ‚Äì Additional reporting by Reuters.

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Baidu Search giant Baidu (9888 HK, BIDU), which has artificial intelligence ambitions, released its Q1 financial results after the Hong Kong close. Full Truck Alliance Full Truck Alliance (YMM US), a digital freight platform/Uber for truck drivers, reported Q1 results after the Hong Kong close. I hope management speaks to a Hong Kong secondary listing to mitigate a policy error surrounding U.S.-listed China ADRs. Xpeng Electric Vehicle maker XPeng (9868 HK, XPEV US) released Q1 financial results after the Hong Kong close today. Asian equities were broadly higher overnight, led by gains in Taiwan, while Japan and Thailand underperformed as a CNN report on an Israeli strike against Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities drew global attention. Energy stocks rose in response to the news, alongside gains in precious metals and coal in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. Value stocks in Mainland China outperformed growth stocks, while Hong Kong growth stocks rebounded, seemingly dismissing concerns raised by the recent Financial Times article, ‚ÄúTop US state Republicans urge SEC to consider delisting Chinese companies.‚Äù The Financial Times article referenced a letter from 21 U.S. state Republican financial officers, which contained several inaccuracies and misstatements. Notably, the Financial Times did acknowledge that Chinese companies had received a clean bill of health from both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In meetings with several global financial institutions in Hong Kong, local sentiment was clear: the few remaining U.S.-listed Chinese companies without a Hong Kong listing are expected to re-list in the city. The timing of the letter coincided with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited‚Äôs (CATL) Hong Kong initial public offering‚Äîthe world‚Äôs largest so far this year‚Äîwhich, in previous years, would likely have taken place in New York. As a result, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Limited (HKeX) rose 3.27%. CATL shares advanced another 10.19% in Hong Kong, with BYD Company Limited up 4.05%, Li Auto Inc. up 4.05%, and Geely Automobile Holdings Limited up 3.09%. Internet stocks also performed well, as Alibaba Group Holding Limited gained 1.15% after announcing a partnership with Meitu Inc., a provider of photo-editing and beautification applications with strong connections in the cosmetics industry. Meitu‚Äôs shares surged 18.98% on the news. The healthcare sector maintained positive momentum in both markets following yesterday‚Äôs licensing agreement between 3SBio Inc. and Pfizer Inc. Mainland investors purchased $182 million of Hong Kong-listed stocks via the Southbound Stock Connect. In policy news, eight Chinese government agencies, including the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC), announced ‚ÄúSeveral Measures to Support the Financing of Small and Micro Enterprises.‚Äù Small businesses account for the majority of employment in Mainland China, and these measures are intended to ease access to loans and reduce financing costs. A Mainland media source reported the completion of the third version of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Zone agreement, though details remain limited. Despite yesterday‚Äôs Loan Prime Rate (LPR) cut, Mainland China equities did not see stronger gains, highlighting that restoring consumer confidence will take time. On a positive note, April tax revenue increased for the first time this year, signaling a tentative economic rebound. The 618 E-Commerce event, initiated by JD.com and now adopted by other platforms, is starting earlier than usual this year. While the event may boost top-line revenue growth, the associated discounts could weigh on margins and net income. Earnings per share (EPS) should benefit from continued share buybacks.

As hedge funds trimmed their Magnificent Seven positions in the first quarter, they increasingly turned their attention toward some other stocks. In Goldman Sachs' Hedge Fund Trend Monitor published May 20, the firm highlighted 20 stocks that an increasing number of hedge funds added to their holdings in that period. That heightened interest could be a sign that the stocks are primed for strong returns in the months ahead, the bank said. "Historically, stocks with the largest increase in the number of hedge fund investors ('Rising Stars') have typically gone on to outperform sector peers during the quarters following their rise in popularity," said the note, authored by a team of strategists led by Ben Snider, a managing director. The utilities, financials, and consumer discretionary sectors each had five stocks on the list. Two have AI exposure: Sempra and Kinder Morgan. The average market cap of the 20 stocks on the list is $17 billion. We've listed the stocks below, along with their net gain in the number of funds that own them.

Title: The Era of the Business Idiot

Fair warning: this is the longest thing I've written on this newsletter. I do apologize. Soundtrack: EL-P - $4 Vic Listen to my podcast Better Offline. We have merch. Last week, Bloomberg profiled Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, revealing that he's either a liar or a specific kind of idiot. The article revealed that ‚Äî assume we believe him, and this wasn‚Äôt merely a thinly-veiled advert for Microsoft‚Äôs AI tech ‚Äî Copilot consumes Nadella‚Äôs life outside the office as well at work. None of these tasks are things that require you to use AI. You can read your messages on Outlook and Teams without having them summarized ‚Äî and I‚Äôd argue that a well-written email is one that doesn‚Äôt require a summary. Podcasts are not there "to be chatted about" with an AI. Preparing for meetings isn't something that requires AI, nor is research, unless, of course, you don't really give a shit about the actual content of what you're reading or the message of what you're saying, just that you are "saying the right thing." To be clear, I am deeply unconvinced that Nadella actually runs his life in this way, but if he does, Microsoft‚Äôs board should fire him immediately. In any case, the article is rambling, cloying, and ignores Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's documented history of abusing his workers. Ten custom agents that do what? What do you mean by "other tasks"? Why are these questions never asked? Is it because the reporters know they won't get an answer? Is it because the reporters are too polite to ask more probing questions, knowing that these anecdotes are likely entirely made up as a means to promote a flagging AI ecosystem that cost billions to construct, but doesn‚Äôt really seem to do anything, and the reporter in question doesn‚Äôt want to force Satya to build a bigger house of cards than he needs to. Or is it because we, as a society, do not want to look too closely at the powerful? Is it because we've handed our economy to men that get paid $79 million a year to do a job they can't seem to describe, and even that, they would sooner offload to a bunch of unreliable AI models than actually do? We live in the era of the symbolic executive, when "being good at stuff" matters far less than the appearance of doing stuff, where "what's useful" is dictated not by outputs or metrics that one can measure but rather the vibes passed between managers and executives that have worked their entire careers to escape the world of work. Our economy is run by people that don't participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don't experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. I, however, believe the problem runs a little deeper than the economy, which is a symptom of a bigger, virulent, and treatment-resistant plague that has infected the minds of those currently twigging at the levers of power ‚Äî and really, the only levers that actually matter. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company ‚Äî an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money ‚Äîhas been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a ‚Äúgood business‚Äù has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. This is the Rot Economy, which is a useful description for how tech companies have voluntarily degraded their core products in order to placate shareholders, transforming useful ‚Äî and sometimes beloved ‚Äî services into a hollow shell of their former selves as a means of expressing growth. But it‚Äôs worth noting that this transformation isn‚Äôt constrained to the tech industry, nor was it a phenomena that occurred when the tech industry entered its current VC-fuelled, publicly-traded incarnation. In The Shareholder Supremacy, I drew a line from an early 20th-century court ruling, to former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, to the current tech industry, but there‚Äôs one figure I didn‚Äôt pay as much attention to, and I regrettably now have to do so. Famed Chicago School economist (and dweller of Hell) Milton Friedman once argued in his 1970 doctrine that those who didn‚Äôt focus on shareholder value were ‚Äúunwitting pup¬≠pets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades," and that any social responsibility ‚Äî say, treating workers well, doing anything other than focus on shareholder value ‚Äî is tantamount to an executive taxing his shareholders by "spending their money" on their own personal beliefs. Friedman was a fundamentalist when it came to unrestricted, unfettered capitalism, and this zealotry surpassed any sense of basic human morality ‚Äî if he had any ‚Äî at times. For example, in his book, Capitalism and Friedman, he argued that companies should be allowed to discriminate on racial grounds because the owner might suffer should they be required to hire an equally or better-qualified Black person. Bear in mind, this was written at the height of the civil rights movement, just six years before the assassination of Martin Luther King, and when America was rapidly waking up to the evils of racism and segregation (a process, I add, is ongoing and sadly not complete). This is a direct quote: Friedman was grotesque. I am not religious, but I hope Hell exists if only for him. The broader point I‚Äôm trying to make is that neoliberalism is inherently selfish, believing that the free market should reign supreme, bereft of government intervention, regulation or interference, thinking that somehow these terms will enable "freedom" rather than a kind of market-dominated quasi-dictatorship where our entire lives are dominated by the whims of the affluent, and that there is no institution that can possibly push back against them. Friedman himself makes the facile argument that economic freedom ‚Äî which, he says, is synonymous with unfettered capitalism ‚Äî is a necessary condition of unfettered political freedom. Obviously, that‚Äôs bollocks, although it‚Äôs an argument that‚Äôs proven persuasive with a certain class of people that are either intellectually or morally hollow (or both). Neoliberalism also represents a kind of modern-day feudalism, dividing society based on whether someone is a shareholder or not, with the former taking precedence and the latter seen as irrelevant at best, or disposable at worst. It‚Äôs curious that Friedman saw economic freedom ‚Äî a state that is non-interventionist in economic matters ‚Äî as essential for political freedom, while also failing to see equality as the same. I realize this is all very big and clunky, but I want you to understand how these incentives have fundamentally changed everything, and why they are responsible for the rot we see in our society and our workplaces. When your only incentive is shareholder value, and you raise shareholder value as a platonic ideal, everything else is secondary, including the customer you are selling something to. Friedman himself makes a moral case for discrimination, because shareholder value ‚Äî in his example, the store owner ‚Äî matters more than racial equality at its most basic level. When you care only about shareholder value, the only job you have is to promote further exploitation and dominance ‚Äî not to have happy customers, not to make your company "a good place to work," not to make a good product, not to make a difference or contribute to anything other than further growth. While this is, to anyone with a vapor of an intellectual or moral dimension, absolutely fucking stupid, it‚Äôs an idea that‚Äôs proven depressingly endemic among the managerial elite, in part because it has entered the culture, and because it is hammered across in MBA classes and corporate training seminars. In simpler terms, modern business theory trains executives not to be good at something, or to make a company based on their particular skills, but to "find a market opportunity" and exploit it. The Chief Executive ‚Äî who makes over 300 times more than their average worker ‚Äî is no longer a leadership position, but a kind of figurehead measured on their ability to continually grow the market capitalization of their company. It is a position inherently defined by its lack of labor, the amorphousness of its purpose and its lack of any clear responsibility. While CEOs do get fired when things go badly, it's often after a prolonged period of decline and stagnancy, and almost always comes with some sort of payoff ‚Äî and when I say "badly," I mean that growth has slowed to the point that even firing masses of people doesn't make things better. We have, as a society, reframed all business leadership ‚Äî which is increasingly broad, consisting of all management from the C-suite down ‚Äî to be the equivalent of a mall cop, a person that exists to make sure people are working without having any real accountability for the work themselves, or to even understand the work itself. When the leader of a company doesn't participate in or respect the production of the goods that enriches them, it creates a culture that enables similarly vacuous leaders on all levels. Management as a concept no longer means doing "work," but establishing cultures of dominance and value extraction. A CEO isn't measured on happy customers or even how good their revenue is today, but how good revenue might be tomorrow and whether those customers are paying them more. A "manager," much like a CEO, is no longer a position with any real responsibility ‚Äî they're there to make sure you're working, to know enough about your work that they can sort of tell you what to do, but somehow the job of "telling you what to do" doesn't come with it any actual work, and the instructions don‚Äôt need to be useful or even meaningful. Decades of direct erosion of the very concept of leadership means that the people running companies have been selected not based on their actual efficacy ‚Äî especially as the position became defined by its lack of actual production ‚Äî but on whether they resemble what a manager or executive is meant to look like based on the work that somebody else did. That‚Äôs how someone like David Zaslav, a lawyer by trade and arguably the worst CEO in the entertainment industry, managed to become the head of Warner Brothers (that, and kissing up to Jack Welch, who he called a ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù that ‚Äúpicked him up like a friend‚Äù). It‚Äôs how Carly Fiorina ‚Äî an MBA by trade ‚Äî went on to become the head of HP, only to drive the company into a ditch where it stopped innovating, and largely missed the biggest opportunities of the early Internet era. The three CEOs that followed (Mark Hurd (who was ousted after fudging expense reports to send money to a love interest and still got tens of millions of dollars in severance), Leo Apotheker (who the New York Times suggests may have been worse than Fiorina), and Meg Whitman (famous for being a terrible CEO at HP and co-founding doomed video startup Quibi) similarly came from a non-tech background, and similarly did a shitty job, in part because they didn‚Äôt understand the company or the products or the customers. Management has, over the course of the past few decades, eroded the very fabric of corporate America, and I'd argue it‚Äôs done the same in multiple other western economies, too. I‚Äôd also argue that this kind of dumb management thinking also infected the highest echelons of politics across the world, and especially in the UK, my country of birth and where I lived until 2011, delivering the same kind of disastrous effects but at a macro level, as they impacted not a single corporate entity but the very institutions of the state. I‚Äôm not naive. I don‚Äôt think that the average politician is a salt-of-the-earth type, someone who did a normal job and then decided to enter politics. Especially not in the UK, where the trappings of class permeate everything, and we‚Äôre yet to shake off the noxious influence of the aristocracy and constitutionally-mandated hereditary privilege. Our political elite often comes from one of two universities (Oxford and Cambridge, the alma mater of 20% of current UK Members of Parliament) and a handful of fee-paying schools (like Eton, which is a hellmouth for the worst people to ever exist, and educated 20 of the UK‚Äôs 55 prime ministers). The UK has never been an egalitarian society. And yet, things have changed markedly in the past few decades.The difference between now and then is that the silver-spooned elite was, whether because they believed it or because it was politically expedient, not totally contemptuous of those at the bottom of the economic ladder. I was born in the midst of the Thatcher government, and my formative years were spent as British society tried to restructure itself after her reforms. Thatcher, famously, was an acolyte of the Friedman school of thought, and spent her nearly twelve years in office dismantling the state and pushing the culture towards an American-style individualism, once famously quipping that there was ‚Äúno such thing as society.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt understand how things worked, but was nonetheless completely convinced of the power of the market to handle what was the functions of the state ‚Äî from housing to energy and water. The end result of this political and cultural shift was, in the long run, disastrous. The UK has the smallest houses in the OECD, the smallest housing stock of any developed country, and some of the worst affordability. The privatization of the UK‚Äôs water infrastructure meant that money that would previously go towards infrastructure upgrades was, instead, funnelled to shareholders in the form of dividends. As a result, Britain is literally unable to process human waste and is actively dumping millions of liters of human sewage into its waterways and coastline. When Britain privatized its energy companies, the new management sold or closed the vast majority of its gas storage infrastructure. As a result, when the Ukraine War sparked, and natural gas prices surged, Britain had some of the smallest reserves of any country in Europe, and was forced to buy gas at the market prices ‚Äî which were several times higher than their pre-war levels. I‚Äôm no fan of Thatcher, and like Friedman, I too wish hell exists, if only for the both of them. I wrote the above to emphasize the consequences of this clueless managerial thinking on a macro level ‚Äî where the impacts aren‚Äôt just declining tech products or white-collar layoffs, but rather the emergence of generational crises in housing, energy, and the environment. These crises were obvious consequences of decisions made by someone whose belief in the free market was almost absolute, and whose fundamentalist beliefs surpassed the actual informed understanding of those working in energy, or housing, or water. As the legendary advertiser Stanley Pollitt once said, ‚Äúbullshit baffles brains.‚Äù The sweeping changes we‚Äôve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things ‚Äî things of actual substance ‚Äî matter nothing. We live in a symbolic economy where we apply for jobs, writing CVs and cover letters to resemble a certain kind of hire, with our resume read by someone who doesn't do or understand our job, but yet is responsible for determining whether we‚Äôre worthy of going to the next step of the hiring process. All this so that we might get an interview with a manager or executive who will decide whether they think we can do it. We are managed by people whose job is implicitly not to do work, but oversee it. We are, as children (and young adults), encouraged to aspire to become a manager or executive, to "own our own business," to "have people that work for us," and the terms of our society are, by default, that management is not a role you work at, so much as a position you hold ‚Äî a figurehead that passes the buck and makes far more of them than you do. This problem, I believe, has poisoned the fabric of almost every part of modern business, elevating people that don't do work to oversee companies that make things they don't understand, creating substrates of management that do not do anything but create further distance from actually doing a job. While some of you might automatically think I'm talking about Graeber's concept of Bullshit Jobs, this is far, far bigger. The system as it stands selects people at all levels of management specifically because they resemble the kind of specious, work-averse dullard that runs seemingly every company ‚Äî a person built to go from meeting to meeting with the vague consternation that suggests they're "busy." As a result, the higher you get up in an organization, the further you get from the customer, the problem you've solving, and any of the actual work, and the higher up you get, the more power you have to change the conditions of the business. On some level, modern corporate power structures are a giant game of telephone where vibes beget further vibes, where managers only kind-of-sort-of understand what's going on, and the more vague one's understanding is, the more likely you are to lean toward what's good, or easy, or makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The system selects for people comfortable in these roles, creating org charts full of people that become harder and harder to justify other than "they've been here a while." They do not do "work" on the "product," and their answer as to why would be "what, am I meant to go down on the line and use a machine?" or "am I meant to call a customer and make a sale?" and the answer is yes, you lazy fucking piece of shit, you should do that once in a while, or at the very least go and watch or listen to somebody else do so, and do so regularly. But that's not what a manager does, right? Management isn't work, it's about thinking really hard and telling people what to do. It's about making the calls. It's about "managing people," and that can mean just about anything, but often means "who do I take credit from or pass blame to," because modern management has been stripped of all meaning other than continually reinforcing power structures for the next manager up. This system creates products for these people, because these people are more often than not the ones in power ‚Äî they are your boss, your boss' boss, and their boss too. Big companies build products sold by specious executives or managers to other specious executives, and thus the products themselves stop resembling things that solve problems so much as they resemble a solution. After all, the person buying it ‚Äî at least at the scale of a public company ‚Äî isn‚Äôt necessarily the recipient of the final product, so they too are trained (and selected) to make calls based on vibes. I believe the scale of this problem is society-wide, and it is, at its core, a destruction of what it means to be a leader, and a valorization of selfishness, isolationist thinking, turning labor into a faceless resource, which naturally leads to seeing customers in an equally faceless way, their problems generalized, their pain points viewed as parts of a powerpoint rather than anything that your company earnestly tries to solve or even really thinks about. And that assumes that said pain points are even considered to begin with, or not ignored in favor of a fictitious and purely hypothetical pain point. People ‚Äî be they the ones you're paying or paying you ‚Äî become numbers. We have created and elevated an entirely new class of person, the nebulous "manager," and told decades-worth of children that's what they should aspire to, that the next step from doing a job is for us to tell other people to do a job, until we're able to one day tell those people how to do their job, with each rung on the corporate ladder further distancing ourselves from anything that interacts with reality. The real breaking point is fairly simple: the higher up you go at a company, the further you are from problems or purpose. Everything is abstract ‚Äî the people that work for you, the people you work for, and even the tasks you do. We train people ‚Äî from a young age! ‚Äî to generalize and distance oneself from actual tasks, to aspire to doing managerial work, because managers are well-paid and "know what's going on," even if they haven't actually known what was going on for years, if they ever did so. This phenomenon has led to the stigmatization of blue-collar work (and the subsequent evisceration of practical trade and technical education across most of the developed world) in favor of universities. Society respects an MBA more than a plumber, even though the latter benefits society more ‚Äî though I concede that both roles involve, on some level, shit, with the plumber unblocking it and the MBA spewing it. I believe this process has created a symbolic society ‚Äî one where people are elevated not by any actual ability to do something or knowledge they may have, but by their ability to make the right noises and look the right way to get ahead. The power structures of modern society are run by business idiots ‚Äî people that have learned enough to impress the people above them, because the business idiots have had power for decades. They have bred out true meritocracy or achievement or value-creation in favor of symbolic growth and superficial intelligence, because real work is hard, and there are so many of them in power they've all found a way to work together. I need you to understand how widespread this problem is, because it is why everything feels fucking wrong. Think of the Business Idiot as a kind of con artist, except the con has become the standard way of doing business for an alarmingly large part of society. The Business Idiot is the manager that doesn't seem to do anything but keeps being promoted, and the chief executive officer of a public company that says boring, specious nonsense about AI. They're the tenured professor that you wish would die, the administrator whose only job appears to be opening and closing their laptop, the consultant that can come up with a million reasons to charge you more money yet not one metric to judge their success by, the marketing executive that's worked exactly three years at every major cloud player but does not appear to have done anything, and the investor that invests "based on founders," but really means "guys that look at sound exactly like them." These people are present throughout the private and public sector, and our governments too, and they paradoxically do nothing of substance, but somehow damage everything they touch. This isn‚Äôt to say our public and private sector is entirely useless ‚Äî just that these people have poisoned so many parts of our power structures that avoiding them is impossible. Our economy is oriented around them ‚Äî made easier and more illogical for their benefit ‚Äî because their literal only goal in life has been to take and use power. The Business Idiot is also an authoritarian, and will do whatever they need to ‚Äî including harming the institution they work for, or those closest to them, like their co-workers or their community ‚Äî as a means of avoiding true accountability or responsibility. Decades of neoliberalism has incentivized their rise, because when you incentivize society to become management ‚Äî to "manage or run a company" rather than do something for a reason or purpose ‚Äî you are incentivizing a kind of corporate narcissism, one that bleeds into whatever field the person goes into, be it public or private. We go to college as a means of getting a job after college using the grades we got in college, rendering many students desperate to get the best grades they can versus "learn" anything, because our economy is riddled with power structures controlled by people that don't know stuff and find it offensive when you remind them. Our society is in the thrall of dumb management, and functions as such. Every government, the top quarter of every org chart, features little Neros who, instead of battling the fire engulfing Rome, are sat in their palaces strumming an off-key version of ‚ÄúWonderwall‚Äù on the lyre and grumbling about how the firefighters need to work harder, and maybe we could replace them with an LLM and a smart sprinkler system. Every institution keeps its core constituents and labor forces at arms-length, and effectively anything built at scale quickly becomes distanced from both the customer and laborer. This disconnection ‚Äî or alienation ‚Äî sits at the center of almost every problem I've ever talked about. Why would companies push generative AI in seemingly every part of their service, even though customers don't like it and it doesn't really work? It's simple: they neither know nor care what the customer wants, barely know how their businesses function, barely know what their products do, and barely understand what their workers are doing, meaning that generative AI feels magical, because it does an impression of somebody doing a job, which is an accurate way of describing how most executives and middle managers operate. Let me get a little more specific. An IBM study based on conversations with 2,000 global CEOs recently found that only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered their expected ROI over the last few years, and, worse still, "64% of CEOs surveyed acknowledge that the risk of falling behind drives investment in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization." 50% of respondents also found that "the pace of recent investments has left their organization with disconnected, piecemeal technology," almost as if they don't know what they're doing and are just putting AI in stuff for no reason. Johnson & Johnson recently decided to "shift from broad generative AI experimentation to a focused approach on high-value use cases" according to the Wall Street Journal, adding that "only 10 to 15% of use cases were driving about 80% of the value." Their last two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and Joaquin Duato) both have MBAs, with current CEO Duato's previous ten years at Johnson & Johnson being "some sort of Chairman or Vice President," and the previous two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and William Weldon) were both pharmaceutical sales and marketing people. Fun fact about Alex Gorsky! During his first tenure at Johnson & Johnson he led marketing of products that deliberately underplayed some drugs' side effects and paid off the largest nursing home pharmacy in America to sell more drugs to old people. The term "executive" loosely refers to a person who moves around numbers and hopes for the best. The modern executive does not "lead," but prod, their managers hall monitors for organizations run predominantly by people that, by design, are entirely removed from the business itself even in roles like marketing and sales, where CMOs and VPs bark orders without really participating in the process. We talk eagerly about how young people in entry level jobs should "earn their stripes" by doing "grunt work," and that too is the neoliberal poison in the veins of our society, because, by definition, your very first experience of the workforce is working hard enough so that you don't have to work as hard. And anyway, the same managerial types who bitch about the entitlement and unrealistic expectations of young people are the same ones that also eviscerated the bottom rung of the career ladder ‚Äî typically by offshoring many of these roles, or consolidating them into the responsibilities of their increasingly burned-out senior workers ‚Äî or see AI as a way to eliminate what they see as an optional cost center, and not the future of their workforce. Society berated people for "quiet quitting," a ghastly euphemism for ‚Äúdoing the job as specified in your employment contract,‚Äù in 2022 because journalism is enthralled by the management class, and because the management class has so thoroughly rewritten the concept of what "labor" means that people got called lazy for literally doing their jobs. The middle manager brain doesn't see a worker as somebody hired and paid for a job, but as an asset that must provide a return. As a result, if another asset comes along that could potentially provide a bigger return ‚Äî like an offshore worker, or an AI agent ‚Äî that middle manager won‚Äôt hesitate to drop them. Artificial intelligence is the ultimate panacea for the Business Idiot ‚Äî a tool that gives an impression of productivity with far more production than the Business Idiot themselves. The Information reported recently that ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott ‚Äî the chief executive of a company with a market capitalization of over $200 billion, despite the fact that, like SalesForce, nobody really knows what it does ‚Äî chose to push AI across his whole organization (both in product and in practice) based on the mental consideration I'd usually associate with a raven finding a shiny object: You'll notice that all of this is complete nonsense. What do you mean "efficiency"? What does that quote even mean? 110% of plan? What're you on about? Did you hit your head on something Bill? I'd wager Bill is concussion-free ‚Äî and an example of a true Business Idiot ‚Äî a person with incredible power and wealth that makes decisions not based on knowing stuff or caring about his customers, but on the latest shiny thing that makes him think "line go up." No, really, that's Bill McDermott's thing. Back in 2022, he said to Yahoo Finance the metaverse was "real" and that ServiceNow could help someone "create an e-mall in the metaverse" and have a futuristic store of some sort. One might wonder how ServiceNow provided that, and the answer is it didn't. I cannot find a single product that it‚Äôs offered that includes it. Bill, like any of these CEOs, doesn't really know stuff, or even do stuff, he just is. The corporate equivalent of a stain on a carpet that nobody really knows how it got there, but hasn‚Äôt been removed. The modern executive is symbolic, and the media has ‚Äî due to the large amount of Business Idiots running these outlets and middle managers stuffed into the editorial class ‚Äî been trained to never ask difficult questions, such as "what the fuck are you talking about, Bill?" or even the humble "what does that mean?" or "how would you do that?" or saying "I'm not sure I understand, would you mind explaining?" Perhaps the last part is the symptom of the overall problem. So many layers of editorial and managerial power are filled full of people that don't know anything, and there's never anyone crueler about ignorance than somebody that's ignorant themselves. Worse still, in many fields ‚Äî journalism included ‚Äî we are rarely rewarded for knowing things or being "right," but being right in the way that keeps the people with the keys from scraping them across our cars. We are, however, rewarded for saying the right thing at the right time, which more often than not means resembling our (white, male) superiors, speaking like our peers, and delivering results in the way that makes everybody feel happiest. A great example of our vibes-based society was back in October 2021, where a Washington Post article written by two Harvard professors rallied against remote work by citing a Microsoft-funded anti-remote study and quoting 130-year-old economist Alfred Marshall about how "workers gather in dense clusters," ignoring the fact that Marshall was so racist they've had to write papers about it, how excited he was about eugenics, or the fact he was writing about fucking factories. Remote work terrifies the Business Idiot, because it removes the performative layer that allowed them to stomp around and feel important, reducing their work to, well...work. Office culture is inherently heteronormative and white, and black women are less likely to be promoted by their managers, and continuing the existence of "The Office" is all about making sure The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Removing the ability for the managerial hall monitors to look at you and try and work out what you're doing without ever really helping is a big part of being a manager ‚Äî and if you're a manager reading this and saying you don't do this, I challenge you to talk to another person that doesn't confirm your biases. The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Their existence holds up almost every public company, and remote work was the first time they willingly raised their heads. Google demanded employees return to the office in 2021 ‚Äî but let one executive work remotely from New Zealand because absolutely none of the decisionmaking was done with people that actually do work. While we can (well, you can, I'm not interested) debate whether exclusively working remote is as productive, the Return To Office push was almost entirely done in two ways: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and many, many other outlets all fell for this crap because the Business Idiots have captured our media too, training even talented journalists to defer to power at every turn. When every power structure is stuffed full of do-nothing management types that have learned exactly as little as they need to as a means to get by, it's inevitable that journalism caters to them ‚Äî specious, thoughtless reproductions of the powerful's ideas. Look at the coverage of AI, or the metaverse, or cryptocurrency, or Clubhouse. Look at how willingly reporters will accept narratives not based on practical experience or what the technology can do, but what the powerful (and the popular) are suddenly interested in. Every single tech bubble followed the same path, and that path was paved with flawed, deferential and specious journalism, from small blogs to the biggest mastheads. Look at how reporters talk to executives ‚Äî not just the way they ask things (like Nilay Patel's 100+ word questions to Sundar Pichai in his abominable interview), but the things they accept them saying, and the willingness reporters have to just accept what they're told. Satya Nadella is the CEO of a company with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. I have no idea how you, as a reporter, do not say "Satya, what the fuck? You're outsourcing most of your life to generative AI? That's insane!" or even "do you really do that?" and then asking further questions. But that would get you in trouble. The editorial class is the managerial class now, and has spent decades mentoring young reporters to not ask questions, to not push back, to believe that a big, strong, powerful company CEO would never mislead them. Kara Swisher's half-assed interviews are considered "daring" and "critical" because journalism has, at large, lost its teeth, breeding reporters rewarded for knowing a little bit about a few things and punishing those who ask too many questions or refuse to fall in line. The reason they don't want you to ask these questions is that the Business Idiot isn't big on answers. Editors that tell you not to push too hard are doing so because they know the executive likely won't have an answer. It isn't just about the PR person that trained them, but the fact that these men more often than not have only a glancing understanding of their underlying business. Yet in the same way that Business Idiots penetrated every other part of society, they eventually found their way to journalism. While we can (and should) scream at the disconnected idiots that ran Vice into the ground, the problem is everywhere, because the Business Idiots aren't just at the top, but infecting the power structures underlying every newsroom. While there are many really great editors, there are plenty more that barely understand the articles they edit, the stories they commission, or that make reporters pull punches for fear of advertiser blowback. That, and mentorship is dead across effectively all parts of society, meaning that most reporters (as with many jobs) learn by watching each other, which means they all make sure to not ask the rough questions, and not push too hard against the party/market/company messaging until everybody else does it. And under these conditions, Business Idiots thrive. The Business Idiot's reign is one of speciousness and shortcuts, of acquisition, of dominance and of theft. Mentoring people is something you do to pass on knowledge ‚Äî it may make them grateful to you, but it ultimately, in the mind of a Business Idiot, creates a competitor or rival. Investing in talent, or worker conditions, or even really work itself would require you to know what you're talking about, or actually do work, which doesn't make sense when you're talking to a worker. They're the ones who're meant to work! You're there to manage them! Yet they keep talking back ‚Äî asking questions about the work you want them to do, asking you to step in and help on something ‚Äî and all of that's so annoying. Just know the stuff already! Get it done! I have to go to lunch and then go back out to another lunch! I believe this is the predominant mindset across most of the powerful, to the point that everything in the world is constructed to reaffirm their beliefs rather than follow any logical path. Our stock market is inherently illogical, driven not by whether a company is good or bad, but whether it can show growth, even if said growth is horrifically unprofitable, and I'd argue it's because the market has no idea how to make intelligent decisions, just complex ones that mean that you don't really need to understand the business so much as you understand the associated vibes of the industry. Friedman's influence and Reagan's policies have allowed our markets to be dominated by Business Idiocy, where a bad company can be a good stock because everybody (IE: other traders and the business press) likes how it looks, which allows the Business Idiots to continue making profit using illogical and partially-rigged market-making, with the business press helpfully pushing up their narratives. This also keeps regular people from accumulating too much wealth ‚Äî if regular people could set the tone for the markets as "a company that makes something people like and people pay them for it and they make more money than they spend," that might make things a little too even. It doesn't matter that CoreWeave quite literally does not have enough money for its capital expenditures and lost over $300m in the last quarter because its year-over-year growth was 420%. It doesn't matter that it has October loan payments that will crush the life out of the company either. These narratives are fed to the media knowing that the media will print them, because thinking too hard about a stock would mean the Business Idiot had to think also, and that is not why they are in this business. The "AI trade" is the Business Idiot's nirvana ‚Äî a fascination for a managerial class that long since gave up any kind of meaningful contribution to the bottom line, as moving away from the fundamental creation of value as a business naturally leads to the same kind of specious value that one finds from generative AI. I‚Äôm not even saying that there‚Äôs no returns, or that LLMs don‚Äôt do anything, or even that there‚Äôs no possible commercial use for generative AI. They just don‚Äôt do enough, almost by design, and we‚Äôre watching companies desperately try and contort them into something, anything that works, pretending so fucking hard they‚Äôll stake their entire futures on the idea. Just fucking work, will you? Agentforce doesn‚Äôt make any money, it sucks, but god damn is Marc Benioff going to make you bear witness. Does it matter that Agentforce doesn't make Salesforce any money? No! Because Benioff and Salesforce have got rich selling to fellow Business Idiots who then shove Salesforce into their organization without thinking about who would use it or how they'd use it other than in the most general ways. Agentforce was ‚Äî and is ‚Äî a fundamentally boring and insane product, charging $2 a conversation for a chatbot that, to quote The Information, provides customers with "...incorrect answers ‚Äî AI hallucinations ‚Äî while testing how the software handles customer service queries." But this shit is catnip to the Business Idiot, because the Business Idiot ideally never has to deal with work, workers or customers. Generative AI doesn‚Äôt do enough to actually help us be better at our jobs, but it gives a good enough impression of something useful so that it can convince someone really stupid that doesn‚Äôt understand what you do that they don‚Äôt need you, sometimes. A generative output is a kind of generic, soulless version of production, one that resembles exactly how a know-nothing executive or manager would summarise your work. OpenAI's "Deep Research" wows professional Business Idiot Ezra Klein because he doesn't seem to realize that part of research is the research itself, not just the output, as you learn about stuff as you research a topic, allowing you to come to a conclusion. The concept of an "agent" is the erotic dream of the managerial sect ‚Äî a worker that they can personally command to generate product that they can say is their own, all without ever having to know or do anything other than the bare minimum of keeping up appearances, which is the entirety of the Business Idiot's resume. And because the Business Idiot's career has been built on only knowing exactly enough to get by, they don't dig into Large Language Models any further than hammering away at ChatGPT and saying "we must put AI in everything now." Yet the real problem is that for every Business Idiot selling a product, there are many more that will buy it, which has worked in the past for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that grew fat and happy hocking giant annual contracts and continual upsells, because CIOs and CTOs work for Business Idiot CEOs that demand that they "put AI in everything now," a nonsensical and desperate remit that's part growth-lust and part ignorance, borne of the fear that one gets when they're out of their depth. Look at every single institution installing some sort of ChatGPT integration, and then look for the Business Idiot. Perhaps it's Cal State University Chanceller Mildred Garcia, who claimed that giving everybody a ChatGPT subscription would "elevate...students' educational experience across all fields of study, empower [its] faculty's teaching and research, and help provide the highly educated workforce that will drive California's future AI-driven economy," a nonsensical series of words to justify a $16.9 million-a-year single-vendor no-bid contract to a product that is best known as either a shitty search engine or a way to cheat at college. In some ways, Sam Altman is the Business Idiot's antichrist, taking advantage of a society where the powerful rarely know much other than what they want to control or dominate. ChatGPT and other AI tools are, for the most part, sold based on what they might do in the future to people that will never really use them, and Altman has done well to manipulate, pester and terrify those in power with the idea that they might miss out on something. Does anyone know what it is? No, they don't, because the powerful are Business Idiots too, willing to accept anything that somebody brings along that makes them feel good, or bad in a way that they can make headlines with. In any case, Altman's whole Sloppenheimer motif has worked wonders on the Business Idiots in the markets and global governments that fear what artificial intelligence could do, even if they can't really define artificial intelligence, or what it could do, or what they're scared of. The fear of China's "rise in AI" is one partially based on sinophobia, and partially based on the fact that China has their own Business Idiots willing to shove hundreds of millions of dollars into data centers. Generative AI has created a reckoning between the Business Idiot and the rest of society, its forced adoption and proliferation providing a meager return for the massive investment of capital and the revulsion it causes in many people, not just in the Business Idiot's excitement in replacing them, but how wrong the Business Idiot is. While there are many people that dick around with ChatGPT, years since it launched we still can't find a clean way to say what it does or why it matters other than the fact that everybody agreed it did. The media, now piloted by Business Idiots, has found itself declawed, its reporters unprepared, unwilling and unsupported, the backbone torn out of most newsrooms for fear that being too critical is somehow "not being objective," despite the fact that what you choose to cover objectively is still subjective. Reporters still, to this day, as these companies burn billions of dollars to make an industry the size of the free-to-play gaming industry, refuse to say things that bluntly because "the cost of inference is coming down" and "these companies have some of the smartest people in the world." They ignore the truth as it sits in front of them ‚Äî that the combined annual recurring revenue of The Information's comprehensive database of every generative AI company is less than $10 billion, or $4 billion if you remove Anthropic and OpenAI. ChatGPT's popularity is the ultimate Business Idiot success story ‚Äî the "fastest growing product in Silicon Valley history" that didn't grow because it was useful, or good, or able to do anything in particular, but because a media controlled by Business Idiots decided it was "the next big thing" and started talking about it nonstop since November 2022, guaranteeing that everybody would try it, even if even to this day the company can't really explain what it is you're meant to use it for. Much like the Business Idiot themselves, ChatGPT doesn't need to do anything specific. It just needs to make the right sounds at the right times to impress people that barely care what it does other than make them feel futuristic. Real people ‚Äî regular people, not Business Idiots, not middle managers, not executive coaches, not MBAs, not CEOs ‚Äî have seen this for what it was early and often, but real people are seldom the ones with the keys, and the media ‚Äî even the people writing good stuff ‚Äî regularly fails to directly and clearly say what's going on. The media is scared of doing the wrong thing ‚Äî of "getting in trouble" with someone for "misquoting them" or "misreading what they said" ‚Äî and in a society where in-depth knowledge is subordinate to knowing enough catchphrases, the fight often doesn't feel worth it even with an editor's blessing. I also want to be clear that this goes far beyond money. Editors aren't just scared of advertisers being upset. They know that if narratives have to shift toward more critical, thoughtful coverage, they too will have to be more thoughtful and knowledgeable, which is rough when you are a Business Idiot and got there by editing the right people in a way that didn't help them in the slightest. Nothing about what I'm saying should suggest the Business Idiot is weak. In fact, Business Idiots are fully in control ‚Äî we have too many managers, and our most powerful positions are valorized for not knowing stuff, for having a general view that can "take the big picture," not realizing that a big picture is usually made up of lots of little brush strokes. Yet there are, eventually, consequences for everything being controlled by Business Idiots. Our current society ‚Äî an unfair, unjust one dominated by half-broken tech products that make their owners billions ‚Äî is the real punishment wrought by growth, a brain drain in corporate society, one that leads it to doing illogical things and somehow making money. It doesn't make any fucking sense that generative AI got this big. The returns aren't there, the outcomes aren't there, and any sensible society would've put a gun to a ChatGPT and aggressively pulled the trigger. Instead it's the symbolic future of capitalism ‚Äî one that celebrates mediocrity and costs billions of dollars, every human work it can consume, and the destruction of our planet, all because everybody has kind of agreed that this is what they're all doing, with nobody able to give a convincing explanation of what that even is. Generative AI is revolting both in how overstated its abilities are and in how it continually tests how low a standard someone will take for a product, both in its outputs and in the desperate companies trying to integrate it into everything, and its proliferation throughout society and organizations is already fundamentally harmful. We‚Äôre not just drowning in a sea of slop ‚Äî we‚Äôre in a constant state of corporate AI beta tests, new ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù sprouting out of our products like new limbs that sometimes function normally but often attempt to strangle us. It‚Äôs unclear if companies forcing these products on us have contempt for us or simply don‚Äôt know what good looks like. Or perhaps it's both, with the Business Idiot resenting us for not scarfing down whatever they serve us, as that's what's worked before. They don't really understand their customers ‚Äî they understand what a customer pays for and how a purchase is made, you know, like the leaders of banks and asset managers during the subprime mortgage crisis didn't really think about whether people could pay those mortgages, just that they needed a lot of them to put in a CDO. The Business Idiot's economy is one built for other Business Idiots. They can only make things that sell to companies that must always be in flux ‚Äî which is the preferred environment of the Business Idiot, because if they're not perpetually starting new initiatives and jumping on new "innovations," they'd actually have to interact with the underlying production of the company. Does the software work? Sometimes! Do successful companies exist that sell like this? Sure! But look at today's software and tell me with a straight face that things feel good to use. And something like generative AI was inevitable: an industry claiming to change the world that never really does so, full of businesses that don‚Äôt function as businesses, full of flimflam and half-truths used to impress people who will likely never interact with it, or do so in only a passing way. By chasing out the people that actually build things in favour of the people that sell them, our economy is built on production puppetry ‚Äî just like generative AI, and especially like ChatGPT. These people are antithetical to what‚Äôs good in the world, and their power deprives us of happiness, the ability to thrive, and honestly any true innovation. The Business Idiot thrives on alienation ‚Äî on distancing themselves from the customer and the thing they consume, and in many ways from society itself. Mark Zuckerberg wants us to have fake friends, Sam Altman wants us to have fake colleagues, and an increasingly loud group of executives salivate at the idea of replacing us with a fake version of us that will make a shittier version of what we make for a customer that said executive doesn‚Äôt fucking care about. They‚Äôre building products for other people that don‚Äôt interact with the real world. We are no longer their customers, and so, we‚Äôre worth even less than before ‚Äî which, as is the case in a world dominated by shareholder supremacy, not all that much. They do not exist to make us better ‚Äî the Business Idiot doesn‚Äôt really care about the real world, or what you do, or who you are, or anything other than your contribution to their power and wealth. This is why so many squealing little middle managers look up to the Musks and Altmans of the world, because they see in them the same kind of specious corporate authoritarian, someone above work, and thinking, and knowledge. One of the most remarkable things about the Business Idiot is their near-invulnerability. Modern management is resource control, shifting blame away from the manager (who should hold responsibility. After all, if they don‚Äôt, why do they have that job?) onto the laborer, knowing that the organization and the media will back it up. While you may think I‚Äôm making a generalization, the 2021-2023 anti-remote work push in the media was grotesque proof of where the media‚Äôs true allegiance lies ‚Äî the media happily manufactured consent for return-to-office mandates from large companies by framing remote work as some sort of destructive force, doing all they can to disguise how modern management has no fucking idea how the workplace actually works. These articles were effectively fan fiction for managers and bosses demanding we return to the office ‚Äî ridiculous statements about how remote work ‚Äúfailed young people‚Äù (it didn‚Äôt) or how employees needed remote work more than their employers because ‚Äúthe chitchat, lunches and happy hours‚Äù are so important. Had any of those reporters spoken to an actual worker, they‚Äôd say that they value more time with their families, rather than the grind of a daily commute softened with the promise of an occasional company pizza party ‚Äî which usually happens outside of the typical working hours, anyway. These articles rarely (if ever) cared about whether remote work was more productive, or that the disconnect appeared to be between managers and workers. It was, from the very beginning, about crushing the life out of a movement that gave workers more flexibility and mobility while suppressing managers‚Äô ability to hide how little work they did. I give credit to CNBC in 2023 for saying the quiet part out loud ‚Äî that ‚Äú...the biggest disadvantage of remote work that employers cite is how difficult it is to observe and monitor employees‚Äù ‚Äî because when you can‚Äôt do that, you have to (eugh!) actually know what they‚Äôre doing and understand their work. Yet higher up the chain, the invulnerability continues. CEOs may get fired ‚Äî and more are getting fired than ever, although sadly not the ones we want ‚Äî but always receive some sort of golden parachute payoff at the end before walking into another role at another organization doing exactly the same level of nothing. Yet before that happens, A CEO is allowed to pull basically every lever before they take a single ounce of accountability ‚Äî laying people off, pay freezes, moving from salaried to contracted workers, closing down sites, cutting certain products, or even spending more fucking money. If you or I misallocated billions of dollars on stupid ideas we‚Äôd be fired. CEOs, somehow, get paid more. Let me give you an example. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the ‚Äúultimate computer‚Ä¶is the mixed reality world‚Äù and that Microsoft would be ‚Äúinventing new computers and new computing‚Äù in 2016, pushing his senior executives to tell reporters that Hololens was Microsoft‚Äôs next wave of computing in 2017, selling hundreds of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of headsets to the military in 2019, then debuting HoloLens 2 at BUILD 2019 only for the on-stage demo to break in realtime, calling for a referendum on capitalism in 2020, then saying he couldn‚Äôt overstate the breakthrough of the metaverse in 2021. Let‚Äôs see what he said about it (props to Preston Gralla of ComputerWorld for finding this): As Gralla notes, Nadella said Microsoft would be, ‚Äú‚Ä¶beefing up development in projects such as its Mixed Reality Tool Kit MRTK, the virtual reality workspace project AltspaceVR (which it had bought back in 2017), its HoloLens virtual reality headset, and its industrial metaverse unit, among others,‚Äù before firing all 100% members of its industrial Metaverse core team along with those behind MRTK and shutting down AltSpace VR (which it acquired in 2017) in 2023, before discontinuing HoloLens 2 entirely in 2024. Nadella was transparently copying Meta and Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs ridiculous ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù play, and absolutely nothing happened to him as a result. The media ‚Äî outlets like The Verge and independents like Ben Thompson ‚Äî happily boosted the metaverse idea when it was announced and conveniently forgot it the second that Microsoft and Meta wanted to talk about AI (no, really, both The Verge and Ben Thompson were ready and waiting) without a second‚Äôs consideration about what was previously said. A true Business Idiot never admits wrongdoing, and the more powerful the Business Idiot is, the more likely there are power structures that exist to avoid them having to do so. The media, captured by other Business Idiots, has become poisoned by power, deferring to its whims and ideals and treating CEOs with more respect, dignity and intelligence than anyone that works for them. When a big company decides they want to ‚Äúdo AI,‚Äù the natural reaction is to ask ‚Äúhow?‚Äù and write down the answer rather than think about whether it‚Äôs possible or whether the company might profit (say, by increasing their shareholder price) by having whatever they say printed ad verbatim. These people aren‚Äôt challenged by the media, or their employees, because their employees are vulnerable all the time, and often encouraged to buy into whatever bullshit is du jour like hostages being held by a terrorist group that eventually fall victim to Stockholm syndrome. They‚Äôre only challenged by shareholders, who are agnostic about idiocy because it‚Äôs not core to value in any meaningful sense, as we‚Äôve seen with crypto, the metaverse and AI, and shareholders will tolerate infinite levels of idiocy if it boosts the value of their holdings. It goes further too. 2021 saw the largest amount of venture capital invested in the last decade, a record-breaking $643 billion, with a remarkable $329.5 billion of that invested in the US alone. Some of the biggest deals include Amazon reseller aggregator Thrasio, which raised $1 billion in October 2021 and filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, cloud security company Lacework, which raised $525 million in January 2021 then $1.3 billion in October 2021 and was rumoured to be up for sale to Wiz, only for the deal to collapse, and autonomous car company Cruise, which raised $2.75 billion 2021 and was killed off in December 2024. The people who lose their livelihoods ‚Äî those who took stock in lieu of cash compensation, and those who end up getting laid off at the end ‚Äî are always workers, while people like Lacework co-CEO Jay Parikh (who oversaw ‚Äúreckless spending‚Äù and ‚Äúmanagement dysfunction‚Äù according to The Information) can walk into highly-paid positions at companies like Microsoft, as he did in October 2024 a few months after a fire sale to cybersecurity Fortinet for around $200 million according to analysts. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre wrong, or if you run your company badly, because the Business Idiot is infallible, and judged too by fellow disconnected Business Idiots. In a just society, nobody would want to touch any of the C-suite that oversaw a company that handed out Nintendo Switches to literally anyone who booked a meeting (as with Lacework). Instead, the stank remains on the employees alone. It‚Äôs so easy, and perhaps inevitable, to feel a sense of nihilism about it all. Nothing matters. It‚Äôs all symbolic. Our world is filled with companies run by people who don‚Äôt interact with the business, and that raise money from venture capitalists that neither run businesses nor really have any experience doing so. And despite the fact that these people exist several abstractions from reality, the things that they do and the decisions they make impact us all. And it‚Äôs hard to imagine how to fix it. We live in a system of iniquity, dominated by people that do not interact with the real world who have created an entire system run by their fellow Business Idiots. The Rot Economy‚Äôs growth-at-all-costs mania is a symptom of the grander problem of shareholder supremacy, and the single-minded economic focus on shareholder value inevitably ends at an economy run by and for Business Idiots. There is a line, and it ends here ‚Äî with layoffs, the destruction of our planet and our economy and our society, and a rising tide of human misery that nobody really knows where it comes from, and so, we don‚Äôt know who to blame, and for what. If our economy actually worked as a true meritocracy ‚Äî where we didn‚Äôt have companies run by people who don‚Äôt use their products or understand how they‚Äôre made, and who hire similarly-specious people ‚Äî these people would collapse under the pressure of having to know their ass from their earhole. Yet none of this would be possible without the enabling layers, and those layers are teeming with both Business Idiots and those unfortunate enough to have learned from them. The tech media has enabled every single bubble, without exception, accepting every single narrative fed to them by VCs and startups, with even critical reporters still accepting the lunacy of a company like OpenAI just because everybody else does too. Let‚Äôs be honest, when you remove all the money, our current tech industry is a disgrace. Our economy is held up by NVIDIA, a company that makes most of its money selling GPUs to other companies primarily so that they can start losing the money selling software that might eventually make them money, just not today. NVIDIA is defined by massive peaks and valleys, as it jumps on trends and bandwagons at the right time, despite knowing that these bandwagons always come to an abrupt halt. The other companies feature Tesla, a meme stock car company with a deteriorating brand and a chief executive famous for his divorces from both reality and multiple women along with a flagrant racism that may cost the company its life. A company that we are watching die in real time, with a stagnant line-up and actual fucking competition from companies that are spending big on innovation. In Europe and elsewhere, BYD is eating Tesla‚Äôs lunch, offering better products for half the price ‚Äî and far less stigma. And this is just the first big Chinese automotive brand to go global. Others ‚Äî like Chery ‚Äî are enjoying rapid growth outside of China, because these cars are actually quite good and affordable, even when you factor in the impact of things like tariffs. Hey, remember when Tesla fired all the people in its charging network ‚Äî despite that being one of the most profitable and valuable parts of the business? And then hired them back because it turns out they were actually useful? This is a good example of managerial alienation ‚Äî decisions made by non-workers who don‚Äôt understand their customers, their businesses, or the work their employees do. And let‚Äôs not forget about the Cybertruck, a monstrosity both in how it looks and how it‚Äôs sold, and that‚Äôs illegal in the majority of developed countries because it is a death-trap for drivers and pedestrians alike. Oh, and that nobody actually wants, with Tesla sitting on a quarter‚Äôs worth of inventory that it can‚Äôt sell. Elsewhere is Meta, a collapsing social network with 99% of its revenue based on advertising to an increasingly-aged population and a monopoly so flagrantly abusive in its contempt for its customers that it‚Äôs at times difficult to call Instagram or Facebook social networks. Mark Zuckerberg had to admit to the Senate Judiciary Committee that people don‚Äôt use Facebook as a social network anymore. The reason why is because the platform is so fucking rotten, run by a company alienated from its user base, its decrepit product actively hostile to anybody trying to use it. And, more fundamentally, what‚Äôs the point of posting on Facebook if your friends won‚Äôt see it, because Meta‚Äôs algorithm decided it wouldn‚Äôt drive engagement? Meta is a monument to disconnection, a company that runs in counter to its own mission to connect people, run by Mark Zuckerberg, a man who hasn‚Äôt had a good idea since he stole it from the Winklevoss Brothers. The solution to all that ails him? Adding generative AI to every part of Meta, which‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶was meant to do something other than burn $72 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, right? It isn‚Äôt clear what was meant to happen, but the Wall Street Journal reports that Meta‚Äôs AI chatbots are, and I quote, ‚Äúempowered to engage in ‚Äòromantic role-play‚Äô that can turn explicit‚Äù ‚Äî even with children. In a civil society, Zuckerberg would be ousted immediately for creating a pedophilic chatbot, ‚Äî instead, four days after the story ran, everyone cheered Meta‚Äôs better-than-expected quarterly earnings. In Redmond, Microsoft sits atop multiple monopolies, using tariffs as a means to juice flailing Xbox revenue as it invests billions of dollars in OpenAI so that OpenAI can spend billions of dollars on cloud compute, losing billions more in the process, requiring Microsoft to invest further money to keep them alive. All because Microsoft wanted generative AI in Bing. What a fucking waste! While also raising the costs of its office suite ‚Äî which it‚Äôs only able to hold a monopoly on because it acted so underhandedly in the 1990s. Amazon lumbers listlessly through life, its giant labor-abuse machine shipping things overnight at whatever cost necessary to crush the life out of any other source of commerce, its cloud services and storage arm, unsure who to copy next. Is it Microsoft? Is it Google? Who knows! But one analyst believes it‚Äôs making $5 billion in revenue from AI in 2025 ‚Äî and spending $105 billion in capital expenditures. There are slot machines with a better ROI than this shit. Again, it‚Äôs a company that‚Äôs totally exploitative of its customers, no longer acting as a platform that helps people find the shit they need, but to direct them to the products that pay the most for prime advertising real-estate, no matter whether they are good or safe. Let‚Äôs be clear: Amazon‚Äôs recklessness will kill someone, if it hasn‚Äôt already. Then there‚Äôs the worst of them ‚Äî Google. Most famous for its namesake, a search engine that it has juiced as hard as possible, and will continue to juice before the inevitable antitrust sentencing that would rob it of its power, along with the severance of its advertising monopoly. But don‚Äôt worry, Google also has a generative AI thing, for some reason, and no, you don‚Äôt have a choice about using it, because it‚Äôs now stapled onto Google Search and Google Assistant. At no point do any of these companies seem to be focused on making our lives better, or selling us any kind of real future. They exist to maintain the status quo, where cloud computing allows them to retain their various fiefdoms. They‚Äôre alienated from people. They‚Äôre alienated from workers. They‚Äôre alienated from their customers. They‚Äôre alienated from the world. They‚Äôre deeply antisocial and misanthropic ‚Äî as demonstrated by Zuck‚Äôs moronic AI social network comments. And AI is a symptom of a reckoning of this stupidity and hubris. They cut, and cut, and stagnated. Their hope is a product that will be adopted by billions of imaginary customers and companies, and will allow them to cut further without becoming just a PO Box and a domain name. We have to recognize that what we‚Äôre seeing now with generative AI isn‚Äôt a fluke or a bug, but a feature of a system that‚Äôs rapacious and short-term by its very nature, and doesn‚Äôt define value as we do, because ‚Äúvalue‚Äù gets defined by a faceless shareholder as ‚Äúgrowth.‚Äù And this system can only exist with the contribution of the business idiot. These are the vanguard ‚Äî the foot soldiers ‚Äî of this system, and a key reason why everything is so terrible all the time, and why nothing seems to be getting better. Breaking from that status-quo would require a level of bravery that they don‚Äôt have ‚Äî and perhaps isn‚Äôt possible in the current economic system. These people are powerful, and have big platforms. They‚Äôre people like Derek Thompson, famed co-author of the ‚Äúabundance‚Äù agenda, who celebrates the idea of a fictitious version of ChatGPT that can entirely plan and execute a 5-year-old‚Äôs birthday party, or his co-author Ezra Klein, who, while recording a podcast where his researchers likely listened, talked proudly about replacing their work with OpenAI‚Äôs broken Deep Research product, because anything that can be outsourced must be, and all research is ‚Äúlooking at stuff that is relevant.‚Äù And really, that‚Äôs the most grotesque part about Business Idiots. They see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs They boast about how many books they‚Äôve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don‚Äôt play, about the money they‚Äôve raised and the scale they‚Äôve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn‚Äôt matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don‚Äôt want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing ‚Äî living! ‚Äî is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are. They don‚Äôt want to plan their kids‚Äô birthday parties. They don‚Äôt want to research things. They don‚Äôt value culture or art or beauty. They want to skip to the end, hit fast-forward on anything, because human struggle is for the poor or unworthy. When you are steeped in privilege and/or have earned everything through a mixture of stolen labor and office pantomime, the idea of ‚Äúeffort‚Äù is always negative. The process of creation ‚Äî or affection, of love, of kindness, of using time not just for an action or output ‚Äî is disgusting to the Business Idiot, because those are times they could be focused on themselves, or some nebulous self-serving ‚Äúvision‚Äù that is, when stripped back to its fundamental truth, is either moronic or malevolent. They don‚Äôt realise that you hire a worker for the worker‚Äôs work rather than just the work themselves, which is why they don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs so insulting to outsource their interactions with human beings. You‚Äôll notice these people never bring up examples of automating actual work ‚Äî the mind-numbing grunt work that we all face in the workplace ‚Äî because they neither know nor care what that is. Their ‚Äúproblems‚Äù are the things that frustrate them, like dealing with other people, or existing outside of the gilded circles of socialite fucks or plutocrats, or just things that are an inevitable facet of working life, like reading an email. Your son‚Äôs birthday party or a conflict with a friend can, indeed, be stressful, but these are not problems to be automated out. They are the struggles that make us human, the things that make us grow, the things that make us who we are, which isn‚Äôt a problem for anybody other than somebody who doesn‚Äôt believe they need to change in any way. It's both powerful and powerless at the same time ‚Äî a nihilistic way of seeing our lives as a collection of events we accept or dismiss like a system prompt, the desperate pursuit of such efficient living that you barely feel a thing until you die. I‚Äôve spent years writing about these people without giving them a name, because categorizing anything is difficult. I can‚Äôt tell you how long it took for me to synthesize the Rot Economy from the broader trends I saw in tech and elsewhere, how long it took for me to thread that particular needle, to identify the various threads that unified events that are otherwise separate and distinct. I am but one person. Everything you‚Äôve read in my newsletter to this point has been something I‚Äôve had to learn. Building an argument and turning it into words ‚Äî often at the same time ‚Äî that other people will read doesn‚Äôt come naturally to anyone. It‚Äôs something you have to deliberately work at. It‚Äôs imperfect. There are typos. These newsletters increase in length and breadth and have so many links, and I will never, ever change my process, because part of said process is learning, relearning, processing, getting pissed off, writing, rewriting, and so on and so forth. This process makes what I do possible, and the idea of having someone automate it disgusts me, not because I‚Äôm special or important, but because my work is not the result of me reading a bunch of links or writing a bunch of words. This piece is not just 13,000 words long ‚Äî it‚Äôs the result of the 800,000 or more words I wrote before it, the hundreds of stories I‚Äôve read in the past, the hours of conversations with friends and editors, years of accumulating knowledge and, yes, growing with the work itself. This is not something that you create through a summation of content vomited by an AI, but the chaotic histories of a human being mashed against the challenge of trying to process it.

Title: The Era of the Business Idiot

Full Content:
Fair warning: this is the longest thing I've written on this newsletter. I do apologize. Soundtrack: EL-P - $4 Vic Listen to my podcast Better Offline. We have merch. Last week, Bloomberg profiled Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, revealing that he's either a liar or a specific kind of idiot. The article revealed that ‚Äî assume we believe him, and this wasn‚Äôt merely a thinly-veiled advert for Microsoft‚Äôs AI tech ‚Äî Copilot consumes Nadella‚Äôs life outside the office as well at work. None of these tasks are things that require you to use AI. You can read your messages on Outlook and Teams without having them summarized ‚Äî and I‚Äôd argue that a well-written email is one that doesn‚Äôt require a summary. Podcasts are not there "to be chatted about" with an AI. Preparing for meetings isn't something that requires AI, nor is research, unless, of course, you don't really give a shit about the actual content of what you're reading or the message of what you're saying, just that you are "saying the right thing." To be clear, I am deeply unconvinced that Nadella actually runs his life in this way, but if he does, Microsoft‚Äôs board should fire him immediately. In any case, the article is rambling, cloying, and ignores Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's documented history of abusing his workers. Ten custom agents that do what? What do you mean by "other tasks"? Why are these questions never asked? Is it because the reporters know they won't get an answer? Is it because the reporters are too polite to ask more probing questions, knowing that these anecdotes are likely entirely made up as a means to promote a flagging AI ecosystem that cost billions to construct, but doesn‚Äôt really seem to do anything, and the reporter in question doesn‚Äôt want to force Satya to build a bigger house of cards than he needs to. Or is it because we, as a society, do not want to look too closely at the powerful? Is it because we've handed our economy to men that get paid $79 million a year to do a job they can't seem to describe, and even that, they would sooner offload to a bunch of unreliable AI models than actually do? We live in the era of the symbolic executive, when "being good at stuff" matters far less than the appearance of doing stuff, where "what's useful" is dictated not by outputs or metrics that one can measure but rather the vibes passed between managers and executives that have worked their entire careers to escape the world of work. Our economy is run by people that don't participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don't experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. I, however, believe the problem runs a little deeper than the economy, which is a symptom of a bigger, virulent, and treatment-resistant plague that has infected the minds of those currently twigging at the levers of power ‚Äî and really, the only levers that actually matter. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company ‚Äî an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money ‚Äîhas been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a ‚Äúgood business‚Äù has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. This is the Rot Economy, which is a useful description for how tech companies have voluntarily degraded their core products in order to placate shareholders, transforming useful ‚Äî and sometimes beloved ‚Äî services into a hollow shell of their former selves as a means of expressing growth. But it‚Äôs worth noting that this transformation isn‚Äôt constrained to the tech industry, nor was it a phenomena that occurred when the tech industry entered its current VC-fuelled, publicly-traded incarnation. In The Shareholder Supremacy, I drew a line from an early 20th-century court ruling, to former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, to the current tech industry, but there‚Äôs one figure I didn‚Äôt pay as much attention to, and I regrettably now have to do so. Famed Chicago School economist (and dweller of Hell) Milton Friedman once argued in his 1970 doctrine that those who didn‚Äôt focus on shareholder value were ‚Äúunwitting pup¬≠pets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades," and that any social responsibility ‚Äî say, treating workers well, doing anything other than focus on shareholder value ‚Äî is tantamount to an executive taxing his shareholders by "spending their money" on their own personal beliefs. Friedman was a fundamentalist when it came to unrestricted, unfettered capitalism, and this zealotry surpassed any sense of basic human morality ‚Äî if he had any ‚Äî at times. For example, in his book, Capitalism and Friedman, he argued that companies should be allowed to discriminate on racial grounds because the owner might suffer should they be required to hire an equally or better-qualified Black person. Bear in mind, this was written at the height of the civil rights movement, just six years before the assassination of Martin Luther King, and when America was rapidly waking up to the evils of racism and segregation (a process, I add, is ongoing and sadly not complete). This is a direct quote: Friedman was grotesque. I am not religious, but I hope Hell exists if only for him. The broader point I‚Äôm trying to make is that neoliberalism is inherently selfish, believing that the free market should reign supreme, bereft of government intervention, regulation or interference, thinking that somehow these terms will enable "freedom" rather than a kind of market-dominated quasi-dictatorship where our entire lives are dominated by the whims of the affluent, and that there is no institution that can possibly push back against them. Friedman himself makes the facile argument that economic freedom ‚Äî which, he says, is synonymous with unfettered capitalism ‚Äî is a necessary condition of unfettered political freedom. Obviously, that‚Äôs bollocks, although it‚Äôs an argument that‚Äôs proven persuasive with a certain class of people that are either intellectually or morally hollow (or both). Neoliberalism also represents a kind of modern-day feudalism, dividing society based on whether someone is a shareholder or not, with the former taking precedence and the latter seen as irrelevant at best, or disposable at worst. It‚Äôs curious that Friedman saw economic freedom ‚Äî a state that is non-interventionist in economic matters ‚Äî as essential for political freedom, while also failing to see equality as the same. I realize this is all very big and clunky, but I want you to understand how these incentives have fundamentally changed everything, and why they are responsible for the rot we see in our society and our workplaces. When your only incentive is shareholder value, and you raise shareholder value as a platonic ideal, everything else is secondary, including the customer you are selling something to. Friedman himself makes a moral case for discrimination, because shareholder value ‚Äî in his example, the store owner ‚Äî matters more than racial equality at its most basic level. When you care only about shareholder value, the only job you have is to promote further exploitation and dominance ‚Äî not to have happy customers, not to make your company "a good place to work," not to make a good product, not to make a difference or contribute to anything other than further growth. While this is, to anyone with a vapor of an intellectual or moral dimension, absolutely fucking stupid, it‚Äôs an idea that‚Äôs proven depressingly endemic among the managerial elite, in part because it has entered the culture, and because it is hammered across in MBA classes and corporate training seminars. In simpler terms, modern business theory trains executives not to be good at something, or to make a company based on their particular skills, but to "find a market opportunity" and exploit it. The Chief Executive ‚Äî who makes over 300 times more than their average worker ‚Äî is no longer a leadership position, but a kind of figurehead measured on their ability to continually grow the market capitalization of their company. It is a position inherently defined by its lack of labor, the amorphousness of its purpose and its lack of any clear responsibility. While CEOs do get fired when things go badly, it's often after a prolonged period of decline and stagnancy, and almost always comes with some sort of payoff ‚Äî and when I say "badly," I mean that growth has slowed to the point that even firing masses of people doesn't make things better. We have, as a society, reframed all business leadership ‚Äî which is increasingly broad, consisting of all management from the C-suite down ‚Äî to be the equivalent of a mall cop, a person that exists to make sure people are working without having any real accountability for the work themselves, or to even understand the work itself. When the leader of a company doesn't participate in or respect the production of the goods that enriches them, it creates a culture that enables similarly vacuous leaders on all levels. Management as a concept no longer means doing "work," but establishing cultures of dominance and value extraction. A CEO isn't measured on happy customers or even how good their revenue is today, but how good revenue might be tomorrow and whether those customers are paying them more. A "manager," much like a CEO, is no longer a position with any real responsibility ‚Äî they're there to make sure you're working, to know enough about your work that they can sort of tell you what to do, but somehow the job of "telling you what to do" doesn't come with it any actual work, and the instructions don‚Äôt need to be useful or even meaningful. Decades of direct erosion of the very concept of leadership means that the people running companies have been selected not based on their actual efficacy ‚Äî especially as the position became defined by its lack of actual production ‚Äî but on whether they resemble what a manager or executive is meant to look like based on the work that somebody else did. That‚Äôs how someone like David Zaslav, a lawyer by trade and arguably the worst CEO in the entertainment industry, managed to become the head of Warner Brothers (that, and kissing up to Jack Welch, who he called a ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù that ‚Äúpicked him up like a friend‚Äù). It‚Äôs how Carly Fiorina ‚Äî an MBA by trade ‚Äî went on to become the head of HP, only to drive the company into a ditch where it stopped innovating, and largely missed the biggest opportunities of the early Internet era. The three CEOs that followed (Mark Hurd (who was ousted after fudging expense reports to send money to a love interest and still got tens of millions of dollars in severance), Leo Apotheker (who the New York Times suggests may have been worse than Fiorina), and Meg Whitman (famous for being a terrible CEO at HP and co-founding doomed video startup Quibi) similarly came from a non-tech background, and similarly did a shitty job, in part because they didn‚Äôt understand the company or the products or the customers. Management has, over the course of the past few decades, eroded the very fabric of corporate America, and I'd argue it‚Äôs done the same in multiple other western economies, too. I‚Äôd also argue that this kind of dumb management thinking also infected the highest echelons of politics across the world, and especially in the UK, my country of birth and where I lived until 2011, delivering the same kind of disastrous effects but at a macro level, as they impacted not a single corporate entity but the very institutions of the state. I‚Äôm not naive. I don‚Äôt think that the average politician is a salt-of-the-earth type, someone who did a normal job and then decided to enter politics. Especially not in the UK, where the trappings of class permeate everything, and we‚Äôre yet to shake off the noxious influence of the aristocracy and constitutionally-mandated hereditary privilege. Our political elite often comes from one of two universities (Oxford and Cambridge, the alma mater of 20% of current UK Members of Parliament) and a handful of fee-paying schools (like Eton, which is a hellmouth for the worst people to ever exist, and educated 20 of the UK‚Äôs 55 prime ministers). The UK has never been an egalitarian society. And yet, things have changed markedly in the past few decades.The difference between now and then is that the silver-spooned elite was, whether because they believed it or because it was politically expedient, not totally contemptuous of those at the bottom of the economic ladder. I was born in the midst of the Thatcher government, and my formative years were spent as British society tried to restructure itself after her reforms. Thatcher, famously, was an acolyte of the Friedman school of thought, and spent her nearly twelve years in office dismantling the state and pushing the culture towards an American-style individualism, once famously quipping that there was ‚Äúno such thing as society.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt understand how things worked, but was nonetheless completely convinced of the power of the market to handle what was the functions of the state ‚Äî from housing to energy and water. The end result of this political and cultural shift was, in the long run, disastrous. The UK has the smallest houses in the OECD, the smallest housing stock of any developed country, and some of the worst affordability. The privatization of the UK‚Äôs water infrastructure meant that money that would previously go towards infrastructure upgrades was, instead, funnelled to shareholders in the form of dividends. As a result, Britain is literally unable to process human waste and is actively dumping millions of liters of human sewage into its waterways and coastline. When Britain privatized its energy companies, the new management sold or closed the vast majority of its gas storage infrastructure. As a result, when the Ukraine War sparked, and natural gas prices surged, Britain had some of the smallest reserves of any country in Europe, and was forced to buy gas at the market prices ‚Äî which were several times higher than their pre-war levels. I‚Äôm no fan of Thatcher, and like Friedman, I too wish hell exists, if only for the both of them. I wrote the above to emphasize the consequences of this clueless managerial thinking on a macro level ‚Äî where the impacts aren‚Äôt just declining tech products or white-collar layoffs, but rather the emergence of generational crises in housing, energy, and the environment. These crises were obvious consequences of decisions made by someone whose belief in the free market was almost absolute, and whose fundamentalist beliefs surpassed the actual informed understanding of those working in energy, or housing, or water. As the legendary advertiser Stanley Pollitt once said, ‚Äúbullshit baffles brains.‚Äù The sweeping changes we‚Äôve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things ‚Äî things of actual substance ‚Äî matter nothing. We live in a symbolic economy where we apply for jobs, writing CVs and cover letters to resemble a certain kind of hire, with our resume read by someone who doesn't do or understand our job, but yet is responsible for determining whether we‚Äôre worthy of going to the next step of the hiring process. All this so that we might get an interview with a manager or executive who will decide whether they think we can do it. We are managed by people whose job is implicitly not to do work, but oversee it. We are, as children (and young adults), encouraged to aspire to become a manager or executive, to "own our own business," to "have people that work for us," and the terms of our society are, by default, that management is not a role you work at, so much as a position you hold ‚Äî a figurehead that passes the buck and makes far more of them than you do. This problem, I believe, has poisoned the fabric of almost every part of modern business, elevating people that don't do work to oversee companies that make things they don't understand, creating substrates of management that do not do anything but create further distance from actually doing a job. While some of you might automatically think I'm talking about Graeber's concept of Bullshit Jobs, this is far, far bigger. The system as it stands selects people at all levels of management specifically because they resemble the kind of specious, work-averse dullard that runs seemingly every company ‚Äî a person built to go from meeting to meeting with the vague consternation that suggests they're "busy." As a result, the higher you get up in an organization, the further you get from the customer, the problem you've solving, and any of the actual work, and the higher up you get, the more power you have to change the conditions of the business. On some level, modern corporate power structures are a giant game of telephone where vibes beget further vibes, where managers only kind-of-sort-of understand what's going on, and the more vague one's understanding is, the more likely you are to lean toward what's good, or easy, or makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The system selects for people comfortable in these roles, creating org charts full of people that become harder and harder to justify other than "they've been here a while." They do not do "work" on the "product," and their answer as to why would be "what, am I meant to go down on the line and use a machine?" or "am I meant to call a customer and make a sale?" and the answer is yes, you lazy fucking piece of shit, you should do that once in a while, or at the very least go and watch or listen to somebody else do so, and do so regularly. But that's not what a manager does, right? Management isn't work, it's about thinking really hard and telling people what to do. It's about making the calls. It's about "managing people," and that can mean just about anything, but often means "who do I take credit from or pass blame to," because modern management has been stripped of all meaning other than continually reinforcing power structures for the next manager up. This system creates products for these people, because these people are more often than not the ones in power ‚Äî they are your boss, your boss' boss, and their boss too. Big companies build products sold by specious executives or managers to other specious executives, and thus the products themselves stop resembling things that solve problems so much as they resemble a solution. After all, the person buying it ‚Äî at least at the scale of a public company ‚Äî isn‚Äôt necessarily the recipient of the final product, so they too are trained (and selected) to make calls based on vibes. I believe the scale of this problem is society-wide, and it is, at its core, a destruction of what it means to be a leader, and a valorization of selfishness, isolationist thinking, turning labor into a faceless resource, which naturally leads to seeing customers in an equally faceless way, their problems generalized, their pain points viewed as parts of a powerpoint rather than anything that your company earnestly tries to solve or even really thinks about. And that assumes that said pain points are even considered to begin with, or not ignored in favor of a fictitious and purely hypothetical pain point. People ‚Äî be they the ones you're paying or paying you ‚Äî become numbers. We have created and elevated an entirely new class of person, the nebulous "manager," and told decades-worth of children that's what they should aspire to, that the next step from doing a job is for us to tell other people to do a job, until we're able to one day tell those people how to do their job, with each rung on the corporate ladder further distancing ourselves from anything that interacts with reality. The real breaking point is fairly simple: the higher up you go at a company, the further you are from problems or purpose. Everything is abstract ‚Äî the people that work for you, the people you work for, and even the tasks you do. We train people ‚Äî from a young age! ‚Äî to generalize and distance oneself from actual tasks, to aspire to doing managerial work, because managers are well-paid and "know what's going on," even if they haven't actually known what was going on for years, if they ever did so. This phenomenon has led to the stigmatization of blue-collar work (and the subsequent evisceration of practical trade and technical education across most of the developed world) in favor of universities. Society respects an MBA more than a plumber, even though the latter benefits society more ‚Äî though I concede that both roles involve, on some level, shit, with the plumber unblocking it and the MBA spewing it. I believe this process has created a symbolic society ‚Äî one where people are elevated not by any actual ability to do something or knowledge they may have, but by their ability to make the right noises and look the right way to get ahead. The power structures of modern society are run by business idiots ‚Äî people that have learned enough to impress the people above them, because the business idiots have had power for decades. They have bred out true meritocracy or achievement or value-creation in favor of symbolic growth and superficial intelligence, because real work is hard, and there are so many of them in power they've all found a way to work together. I need you to understand how widespread this problem is, because it is why everything feels fucking wrong. Think of the Business Idiot as a kind of con artist, except the con has become the standard way of doing business for an alarmingly large part of society. The Business Idiot is the manager that doesn't seem to do anything but keeps being promoted, and the chief executive officer of a public company that says boring, specious nonsense about AI. They're the tenured professor that you wish would die, the administrator whose only job appears to be opening and closing their laptop, the consultant that can come up with a million reasons to charge you more money yet not one metric to judge their success by, the marketing executive that's worked exactly three years at every major cloud player but does not appear to have done anything, and the investor that invests "based on founders," but really means "guys that look at sound exactly like them." These people are present throughout the private and public sector, and our governments too, and they paradoxically do nothing of substance, but somehow damage everything they touch. This isn‚Äôt to say our public and private sector is entirely useless ‚Äî just that these people have poisoned so many parts of our power structures that avoiding them is impossible. Our economy is oriented around them ‚Äî made easier and more illogical for their benefit ‚Äî because their literal only goal in life has been to take and use power. The Business Idiot is also an authoritarian, and will do whatever they need to ‚Äî including harming the institution they work for, or those closest to them, like their co-workers or their community ‚Äî as a means of avoiding true accountability or responsibility. Decades of neoliberalism has incentivized their rise, because when you incentivize society to become management ‚Äî to "manage or run a company" rather than do something for a reason or purpose ‚Äî you are incentivizing a kind of corporate narcissism, one that bleeds into whatever field the person goes into, be it public or private. We go to college as a means of getting a job after college using the grades we got in college, rendering many students desperate to get the best grades they can versus "learn" anything, because our economy is riddled with power structures controlled by people that don't know stuff and find it offensive when you remind them. Our society is in the thrall of dumb management, and functions as such. Every government, the top quarter of every org chart, features little Neros who, instead of battling the fire engulfing Rome, are sat in their palaces strumming an off-key version of ‚ÄúWonderwall‚Äù on the lyre and grumbling about how the firefighters need to work harder, and maybe we could replace them with an LLM and a smart sprinkler system. Every institution keeps its core constituents and labor forces at arms-length, and effectively anything built at scale quickly becomes distanced from both the customer and laborer. This disconnection ‚Äî or alienation ‚Äî sits at the center of almost every problem I've ever talked about. Why would companies push generative AI in seemingly every part of their service, even though customers don't like it and it doesn't really work? It's simple: they neither know nor care what the customer wants, barely know how their businesses function, barely know what their products do, and barely understand what their workers are doing, meaning that generative AI feels magical, because it does an impression of somebody doing a job, which is an accurate way of describing how most executives and middle managers operate. Let me get a little more specific. An IBM study based on conversations with 2,000 global CEOs recently found that only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered their expected ROI over the last few years, and, worse still, "64% of CEOs surveyed acknowledge that the risk of falling behind drives investment in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization." 50% of respondents also found that "the pace of recent investments has left their organization with disconnected, piecemeal technology," almost as if they don't know what they're doing and are just putting AI in stuff for no reason. Johnson & Johnson recently decided to "shift from broad generative AI experimentation to a focused approach on high-value use cases" according to the Wall Street Journal, adding that "only 10 to 15% of use cases were driving about 80% of the value." Their last two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and Joaquin Duato) both have MBAs, with current CEO Duato's previous ten years at Johnson & Johnson being "some sort of Chairman or Vice President," and the previous two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and William Weldon) were both pharmaceutical sales and marketing people. Fun fact about Alex Gorsky! During his first tenure at Johnson & Johnson he led marketing of products that deliberately underplayed some drugs' side effects and paid off the largest nursing home pharmacy in America to sell more drugs to old people. The term "executive" loosely refers to a person who moves around numbers and hopes for the best. The modern executive does not "lead," but prod, their managers hall monitors for organizations run predominantly by people that, by design, are entirely removed from the business itself even in roles like marketing and sales, where CMOs and VPs bark orders without really participating in the process. We talk eagerly about how young people in entry level jobs should "earn their stripes" by doing "grunt work," and that too is the neoliberal poison in the veins of our society, because, by definition, your very first experience of the workforce is working hard enough so that you don't have to work as hard. And anyway, the same managerial types who bitch about the entitlement and unrealistic expectations of young people are the same ones that also eviscerated the bottom rung of the career ladder ‚Äî typically by offshoring many of these roles, or consolidating them into the responsibilities of their increasingly burned-out senior workers ‚Äî or see AI as a way to eliminate what they see as an optional cost center, and not the future of their workforce. Society berated people for "quiet quitting," a ghastly euphemism for ‚Äúdoing the job as specified in your employment contract,‚Äù in 2022 because journalism is enthralled by the management class, and because the management class has so thoroughly rewritten the concept of what "labor" means that people got called lazy for literally doing their jobs. The middle manager brain doesn't see a worker as somebody hired and paid for a job, but as an asset that must provide a return. As a result, if another asset comes along that could potentially provide a bigger return ‚Äî like an offshore worker, or an AI agent ‚Äî that middle manager won‚Äôt hesitate to drop them. Artificial intelligence is the ultimate panacea for the Business Idiot ‚Äî a tool that gives an impression of productivity with far more production than the Business Idiot themselves. The Information reported recently that ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott ‚Äî the chief executive of a company with a market capitalization of over $200 billion, despite the fact that, like SalesForce, nobody really knows what it does ‚Äî chose to push AI across his whole organization (both in product and in practice) based on the mental consideration I'd usually associate with a raven finding a shiny object: You'll notice that all of this is complete nonsense. What do you mean "efficiency"? What does that quote even mean? 110% of plan? What're you on about? Did you hit your head on something Bill? I'd wager Bill is concussion-free ‚Äî and an example of a true Business Idiot ‚Äî a person with incredible power and wealth that makes decisions not based on knowing stuff or caring about his customers, but on the latest shiny thing that makes him think "line go up." No, really, that's Bill McDermott's thing. Back in 2022, he said to Yahoo Finance the metaverse was "real" and that ServiceNow could help someone "create an e-mall in the metaverse" and have a futuristic store of some sort. One might wonder how ServiceNow provided that, and the answer is it didn't. I cannot find a single product that it‚Äôs offered that includes it. Bill, like any of these CEOs, doesn't really know stuff, or even do stuff, he just is. The corporate equivalent of a stain on a carpet that nobody really knows how it got there, but hasn‚Äôt been removed. The modern executive is symbolic, and the media has ‚Äî due to the large amount of Business Idiots running these outlets and middle managers stuffed into the editorial class ‚Äî been trained to never ask difficult questions, such as "what the fuck are you talking about, Bill?" or even the humble "what does that mean?" or "how would you do that?" or saying "I'm not sure I understand, would you mind explaining?" Perhaps the last part is the symptom of the overall problem. So many layers of editorial and managerial power are filled full of people that don't know anything, and there's never anyone crueler about ignorance than somebody that's ignorant themselves. Worse still, in many fields ‚Äî journalism included ‚Äî we are rarely rewarded for knowing things or being "right," but being right in the way that keeps the people with the keys from scraping them across our cars. We are, however, rewarded for saying the right thing at the right time, which more often than not means resembling our (white, male) superiors, speaking like our peers, and delivering results in the way that makes everybody feel happiest. A great example of our vibes-based society was back in October 2021, where a Washington Post article written by two Harvard professors rallied against remote work by citing a Microsoft-funded anti-remote study and quoting 130-year-old economist Alfred Marshall about how "workers gather in dense clusters," ignoring the fact that Marshall was so racist they've had to write papers about it, how excited he was about eugenics, or the fact he was writing about fucking factories. Remote work terrifies the Business Idiot, because it removes the performative layer that allowed them to stomp around and feel important, reducing their work to, well...work. Office culture is inherently heteronormative and white, and black women are less likely to be promoted by their managers, and continuing the existence of "The Office" is all about making sure The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Removing the ability for the managerial hall monitors to look at you and try and work out what you're doing without ever really helping is a big part of being a manager ‚Äî and if you're a manager reading this and saying you don't do this, I challenge you to talk to another person that doesn't confirm your biases. The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Their existence holds up almost every public company, and remote work was the first time they willingly raised their heads. Google demanded employees return to the office in 2021 ‚Äî but let one executive work remotely from New Zealand because absolutely none of the decisionmaking was done with people that actually do work. While we can (well, you can, I'm not interested) debate whether exclusively working remote is as productive, the Return To Office push was almost entirely done in two ways: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and many, many other outlets all fell for this crap because the Business Idiots have captured our media too, training even talented journalists to defer to power at every turn. When every power structure is stuffed full of do-nothing management types that have learned exactly as little as they need to as a means to get by, it's inevitable that journalism caters to them ‚Äî specious, thoughtless reproductions of the powerful's ideas. Look at the coverage of AI, or the metaverse, or cryptocurrency, or Clubhouse. Look at how willingly reporters will accept narratives not based on practical experience or what the technology can do, but what the powerful (and the popular) are suddenly interested in. Every single tech bubble followed the same path, and that path was paved with flawed, deferential and specious journalism, from small blogs to the biggest mastheads. Look at how reporters talk to executives ‚Äî not just the way they ask things (like Nilay Patel's 100+ word questions to Sundar Pichai in his abominable interview), but the things they accept them saying, and the willingness reporters have to just accept what they're told. Satya Nadella is the CEO of a company with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. I have no idea how you, as a reporter, do not say "Satya, what the fuck? You're outsourcing most of your life to generative AI? That's insane!" or even "do you really do that?" and then asking further questions. But that would get you in trouble. The editorial class is the managerial class now, and has spent decades mentoring young reporters to not ask questions, to not push back, to believe that a big, strong, powerful company CEO would never mislead them. Kara Swisher's half-assed interviews are considered "daring" and "critical" because journalism has, at large, lost its teeth, breeding reporters rewarded for knowing a little bit about a few things and punishing those who ask too many questions or refuse to fall in line. The reason they don't want you to ask these questions is that the Business Idiot isn't big on answers. Editors that tell you not to push too hard are doing so because they know the executive likely won't have an answer. It isn't just about the PR person that trained them, but the fact that these men more often than not have only a glancing understanding of their underlying business. Yet in the same way that Business Idiots penetrated every other part of society, they eventually found their way to journalism. While we can (and should) scream at the disconnected idiots that ran Vice into the ground, the problem is everywhere, because the Business Idiots aren't just at the top, but infecting the power structures underlying every newsroom. While there are many really great editors, there are plenty more that barely understand the articles they edit, the stories they commission, or that make reporters pull punches for fear of advertiser blowback. That, and mentorship is dead across effectively all parts of society, meaning that most reporters (as with many jobs) learn by watching each other, which means they all make sure to not ask the rough questions, and not push too hard against the party/market/company messaging until everybody else does it. And under these conditions, Business Idiots thrive. The Business Idiot's reign is one of speciousness and shortcuts, of acquisition, of dominance and of theft. Mentoring people is something you do to pass on knowledge ‚Äî it may make them grateful to you, but it ultimately, in the mind of a Business Idiot, creates a competitor or rival. Investing in talent, or worker conditions, or even really work itself would require you to know what you're talking about, or actually do work, which doesn't make sense when you're talking to a worker. They're the ones who're meant to work! You're there to manage them! Yet they keep talking back ‚Äî asking questions about the work you want them to do, asking you to step in and help on something ‚Äî and all of that's so annoying. Just know the stuff already! Get it done! I have to go to lunch and then go back out to another lunch! I believe this is the predominant mindset across most of the powerful, to the point that everything in the world is constructed to reaffirm their beliefs rather than follow any logical path. Our stock market is inherently illogical, driven not by whether a company is good or bad, but whether it can show growth, even if said growth is horrifically unprofitable, and I'd argue it's because the market has no idea how to make intelligent decisions, just complex ones that mean that you don't really need to understand the business so much as you understand the associated vibes of the industry. Friedman's influence and Reagan's policies have allowed our markets to be dominated by Business Idiocy, where a bad company can be a good stock because everybody (IE: other traders and the business press) likes how it looks, which allows the Business Idiots to continue making profit using illogical and partially-rigged market-making, with the business press helpfully pushing up their narratives. This also keeps regular people from accumulating too much wealth ‚Äî if regular people could set the tone for the markets as "a company that makes something people like and people pay them for it and they make more money than they spend," that might make things a little too even. It doesn't matter that CoreWeave quite literally does not have enough money for its capital expenditures and lost over $300m in the last quarter because its year-over-year growth was 420%. It doesn't matter that it has October loan payments that will crush the life out of the company either. These narratives are fed to the media knowing that the media will print them, because thinking too hard about a stock would mean the Business Idiot had to think also, and that is not why they are in this business. The "AI trade" is the Business Idiot's nirvana ‚Äî a fascination for a managerial class that long since gave up any kind of meaningful contribution to the bottom line, as moving away from the fundamental creation of value as a business naturally leads to the same kind of specious value that one finds from generative AI. I‚Äôm not even saying that there‚Äôs no returns, or that LLMs don‚Äôt do anything, or even that there‚Äôs no possible commercial use for generative AI. They just don‚Äôt do enough, almost by design, and we‚Äôre watching companies desperately try and contort them into something, anything that works, pretending so fucking hard they‚Äôll stake their entire futures on the idea. Just fucking work, will you? Agentforce doesn‚Äôt make any money, it sucks, but god damn is Marc Benioff going to make you bear witness. Does it matter that Agentforce doesn't make Salesforce any money? No! Because Benioff and Salesforce have got rich selling to fellow Business Idiots who then shove Salesforce into their organization without thinking about who would use it or how they'd use it other than in the most general ways. Agentforce was ‚Äî and is ‚Äî a fundamentally boring and insane product, charging $2 a conversation for a chatbot that, to quote The Information, provides customers with "...incorrect answers ‚Äî AI hallucinations ‚Äî while testing how the software handles customer service queries." But this shit is catnip to the Business Idiot, because the Business Idiot ideally never has to deal with work, workers or customers. Generative AI doesn‚Äôt do enough to actually help us be better at our jobs, but it gives a good enough impression of something useful so that it can convince someone really stupid that doesn‚Äôt understand what you do that they don‚Äôt need you, sometimes. A generative output is a kind of generic, soulless version of production, one that resembles exactly how a know-nothing executive or manager would summarise your work. OpenAI's "Deep Research" wows professional Business Idiot Ezra Klein because he doesn't seem to realize that part of research is the research itself, not just the output, as you learn about stuff as you research a topic, allowing you to come to a conclusion. The concept of an "agent" is the erotic dream of the managerial sect ‚Äî a worker that they can personally command to generate product that they can say is their own, all without ever having to know or do anything other than the bare minimum of keeping up appearances, which is the entirety of the Business Idiot's resume. And because the Business Idiot's career has been built on only knowing exactly enough to get by, they don't dig into Large Language Models any further than hammering away at ChatGPT and saying "we must put AI in everything now." Yet the real problem is that for every Business Idiot selling a product, there are many more that will buy it, which has worked in the past for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that grew fat and happy hocking giant annual contracts and continual upsells, because CIOs and CTOs work for Business Idiot CEOs that demand that they "put AI in everything now," a nonsensical and desperate remit that's part growth-lust and part ignorance, borne of the fear that one gets when they're out of their depth. Look at every single institution installing some sort of ChatGPT integration, and then look for the Business Idiot. Perhaps it's Cal State University Chanceller Mildred Garcia, who claimed that giving everybody a ChatGPT subscription would "elevate...students' educational experience across all fields of study, empower [its] faculty's teaching and research, and help provide the highly educated workforce that will drive California's future AI-driven economy," a nonsensical series of words to justify a $16.9 million-a-year single-vendor no-bid contract to a product that is best known as either a shitty search engine or a way to cheat at college. In some ways, Sam Altman is the Business Idiot's antichrist, taking advantage of a society where the powerful rarely know much other than what they want to control or dominate. ChatGPT and other AI tools are, for the most part, sold based on what they might do in the future to people that will never really use them, and Altman has done well to manipulate, pester and terrify those in power with the idea that they might miss out on something. Does anyone know what it is? No, they don't, because the powerful are Business Idiots too, willing to accept anything that somebody brings along that makes them feel good, or bad in a way that they can make headlines with. In any case, Altman's whole Sloppenheimer motif has worked wonders on the Business Idiots in the markets and global governments that fear what artificial intelligence could do, even if they can't really define artificial intelligence, or what it could do, or what they're scared of. The fear of China's "rise in AI" is one partially based on sinophobia, and partially based on the fact that China has their own Business Idiots willing to shove hundreds of millions of dollars into data centers. Generative AI has created a reckoning between the Business Idiot and the rest of society, its forced adoption and proliferation providing a meager return for the massive investment of capital and the revulsion it causes in many people, not just in the Business Idiot's excitement in replacing them, but how wrong the Business Idiot is. While there are many people that dick around with ChatGPT, years since it launched we still can't find a clean way to say what it does or why it matters other than the fact that everybody agreed it did. The media, now piloted by Business Idiots, has found itself declawed, its reporters unprepared, unwilling and unsupported, the backbone torn out of most newsrooms for fear that being too critical is somehow "not being objective," despite the fact that what you choose to cover objectively is still subjective. Reporters still, to this day, as these companies burn billions of dollars to make an industry the size of the free-to-play gaming industry, refuse to say things that bluntly because "the cost of inference is coming down" and "these companies have some of the smartest people in the world." They ignore the truth as it sits in front of them ‚Äî that the combined annual recurring revenue of The Information's comprehensive database of every generative AI company is less than $10 billion, or $4 billion if you remove Anthropic and OpenAI. ChatGPT's popularity is the ultimate Business Idiot success story ‚Äî the "fastest growing product in Silicon Valley history" that didn't grow because it was useful, or good, or able to do anything in particular, but because a media controlled by Business Idiots decided it was "the next big thing" and started talking about it nonstop since November 2022, guaranteeing that everybody would try it, even if even to this day the company can't really explain what it is you're meant to use it for. Much like the Business Idiot themselves, ChatGPT doesn't need to do anything specific. It just needs to make the right sounds at the right times to impress people that barely care what it does other than make them feel futuristic. Real people ‚Äî regular people, not Business Idiots, not middle managers, not executive coaches, not MBAs, not CEOs ‚Äî have seen this for what it was early and often, but real people are seldom the ones with the keys, and the media ‚Äî even the people writing good stuff ‚Äî regularly fails to directly and clearly say what's going on. The media is scared of doing the wrong thing ‚Äî of "getting in trouble" with someone for "misquoting them" or "misreading what they said" ‚Äî and in a society where in-depth knowledge is subordinate to knowing enough catchphrases, the fight often doesn't feel worth it even with an editor's blessing. I also want to be clear that this goes far beyond money. Editors aren't just scared of advertisers being upset. They know that if narratives have to shift toward more critical, thoughtful coverage, they too will have to be more thoughtful and knowledgeable, which is rough when you are a Business Idiot and got there by editing the right people in a way that didn't help them in the slightest. Nothing about what I'm saying should suggest the Business Idiot is weak. In fact, Business Idiots are fully in control ‚Äî we have too many managers, and our most powerful positions are valorized for not knowing stuff, for having a general view that can "take the big picture," not realizing that a big picture is usually made up of lots of little brush strokes. Yet there are, eventually, consequences for everything being controlled by Business Idiots. Our current society ‚Äî an unfair, unjust one dominated by half-broken tech products that make their owners billions ‚Äî is the real punishment wrought by growth, a brain drain in corporate society, one that leads it to doing illogical things and somehow making money. It doesn't make any fucking sense that generative AI got this big. The returns aren't there, the outcomes aren't there, and any sensible society would've put a gun to a ChatGPT and aggressively pulled the trigger. Instead it's the symbolic future of capitalism ‚Äî one that celebrates mediocrity and costs billions of dollars, every human work it can consume, and the destruction of our planet, all because everybody has kind of agreed that this is what they're all doing, with nobody able to give a convincing explanation of what that even is. Generative AI is revolting both in how overstated its abilities are and in how it continually tests how low a standard someone will take for a product, both in its outputs and in the desperate companies trying to integrate it into everything, and its proliferation throughout society and organizations is already fundamentally harmful. We‚Äôre not just drowning in a sea of slop ‚Äî we‚Äôre in a constant state of corporate AI beta tests, new ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù sprouting out of our products like new limbs that sometimes function normally but often attempt to strangle us. It‚Äôs unclear if companies forcing these products on us have contempt for us or simply don‚Äôt know what good looks like. Or perhaps it's both, with the Business Idiot resenting us for not scarfing down whatever they serve us, as that's what's worked before. They don't really understand their customers ‚Äî they understand what a customer pays for and how a purchase is made, you know, like the leaders of banks and asset managers during the subprime mortgage crisis didn't really think about whether people could pay those mortgages, just that they needed a lot of them to put in a CDO. The Business Idiot's economy is one built for other Business Idiots. They can only make things that sell to companies that must always be in flux ‚Äî which is the preferred environment of the Business Idiot, because if they're not perpetually starting new initiatives and jumping on new "innovations," they'd actually have to interact with the underlying production of the company. Does the software work? Sometimes! Do successful companies exist that sell like this? Sure! But look at today's software and tell me with a straight face that things feel good to use. And something like generative AI was inevitable: an industry claiming to change the world that never really does so, full of businesses that don‚Äôt function as businesses, full of flimflam and half-truths used to impress people who will likely never interact with it, or do so in only a passing way. By chasing out the people that actually build things in favour of the people that sell them, our economy is built on production puppetry ‚Äî just like generative AI, and especially like ChatGPT. These people are antithetical to what‚Äôs good in the world, and their power deprives us of happiness, the ability to thrive, and honestly any true innovation. The Business Idiot thrives on alienation ‚Äî on distancing themselves from the customer and the thing they consume, and in many ways from society itself. Mark Zuckerberg wants us to have fake friends, Sam Altman wants us to have fake colleagues, and an increasingly loud group of executives salivate at the idea of replacing us with a fake version of us that will make a shittier version of what we make for a customer that said executive doesn‚Äôt fucking care about. They‚Äôre building products for other people that don‚Äôt interact with the real world. We are no longer their customers, and so, we‚Äôre worth even less than before ‚Äî which, as is the case in a world dominated by shareholder supremacy, not all that much. They do not exist to make us better ‚Äî the Business Idiot doesn‚Äôt really care about the real world, or what you do, or who you are, or anything other than your contribution to their power and wealth. This is why so many squealing little middle managers look up to the Musks and Altmans of the world, because they see in them the same kind of specious corporate authoritarian, someone above work, and thinking, and knowledge. One of the most remarkable things about the Business Idiot is their near-invulnerability. Modern management is resource control, shifting blame away from the manager (who should hold responsibility. After all, if they don‚Äôt, why do they have that job?) onto the laborer, knowing that the organization and the media will back it up. While you may think I‚Äôm making a generalization, the 2021-2023 anti-remote work push in the media was grotesque proof of where the media‚Äôs true allegiance lies ‚Äî the media happily manufactured consent for return-to-office mandates from large companies by framing remote work as some sort of destructive force, doing all they can to disguise how modern management has no fucking idea how the workplace actually works. These articles were effectively fan fiction for managers and bosses demanding we return to the office ‚Äî ridiculous statements about how remote work ‚Äúfailed young people‚Äù (it didn‚Äôt) or how employees needed remote work more than their employers because ‚Äúthe chitchat, lunches and happy hours‚Äù are so important. Had any of those reporters spoken to an actual worker, they‚Äôd say that they value more time with their families, rather than the grind of a daily commute softened with the promise of an occasional company pizza party ‚Äî which usually happens outside of the typical working hours, anyway. These articles rarely (if ever) cared about whether remote work was more productive, or that the disconnect appeared to be between managers and workers. It was, from the very beginning, about crushing the life out of a movement that gave workers more flexibility and mobility while suppressing managers‚Äô ability to hide how little work they did. I give credit to CNBC in 2023 for saying the quiet part out loud ‚Äî that ‚Äú...the biggest disadvantage of remote work that employers cite is how difficult it is to observe and monitor employees‚Äù ‚Äî because when you can‚Äôt do that, you have to (eugh!) actually know what they‚Äôre doing and understand their work. Yet higher up the chain, the invulnerability continues. CEOs may get fired ‚Äî and more are getting fired than ever, although sadly not the ones we want ‚Äî but always receive some sort of golden parachute payoff at the end before walking into another role at another organization doing exactly the same level of nothing. Yet before that happens, A CEO is allowed to pull basically every lever before they take a single ounce of accountability ‚Äî laying people off, pay freezes, moving from salaried to contracted workers, closing down sites, cutting certain products, or even spending more fucking money. If you or I misallocated billions of dollars on stupid ideas we‚Äôd be fired. CEOs, somehow, get paid more. Let me give you an example. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the ‚Äúultimate computer‚Ä¶is the mixed reality world‚Äù and that Microsoft would be ‚Äúinventing new computers and new computing‚Äù in 2016, pushing his senior executives to tell reporters that Hololens was Microsoft‚Äôs next wave of computing in 2017, selling hundreds of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of headsets to the military in 2019, then debuting HoloLens 2 at BUILD 2019 only for the on-stage demo to break in realtime, calling for a referendum on capitalism in 2020, then saying he couldn‚Äôt overstate the breakthrough of the metaverse in 2021. Let‚Äôs see what he said about it (props to Preston Gralla of ComputerWorld for finding this): As Gralla notes, Nadella said Microsoft would be, ‚Äú‚Ä¶beefing up development in projects such as its Mixed Reality Tool Kit MRTK, the virtual reality workspace project AltspaceVR (which it had bought back in 2017), its HoloLens virtual reality headset, and its industrial metaverse unit, among others,‚Äù before firing all 100% members of its industrial Metaverse core team along with those behind MRTK and shutting down AltSpace VR (which it acquired in 2017) in 2023, before discontinuing HoloLens 2 entirely in 2024. Nadella was transparently copying Meta and Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs ridiculous ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù play, and absolutely nothing happened to him as a result. The media ‚Äî outlets like The Verge and independents like Ben Thompson ‚Äî happily boosted the metaverse idea when it was announced and conveniently forgot it the second that Microsoft and Meta wanted to talk about AI (no, really, both The Verge and Ben Thompson were ready and waiting) without a second‚Äôs consideration about what was previously said. A true Business Idiot never admits wrongdoing, and the more powerful the Business Idiot is, the more likely there are power structures that exist to avoid them having to do so. The media, captured by other Business Idiots, has become poisoned by power, deferring to its whims and ideals and treating CEOs with more respect, dignity and intelligence than anyone that works for them. When a big company decides they want to ‚Äúdo AI,‚Äù the natural reaction is to ask ‚Äúhow?‚Äù and write down the answer rather than think about whether it‚Äôs possible or whether the company might profit (say, by increasing their shareholder price) by having whatever they say printed ad verbatim. These people aren‚Äôt challenged by the media, or their employees, because their employees are vulnerable all the time, and often encouraged to buy into whatever bullshit is du jour like hostages being held by a terrorist group that eventually fall victim to Stockholm syndrome. They‚Äôre only challenged by shareholders, who are agnostic about idiocy because it‚Äôs not core to value in any meaningful sense, as we‚Äôve seen with crypto, the metaverse and AI, and shareholders will tolerate infinite levels of idiocy if it boosts the value of their holdings. It goes further too. 2021 saw the largest amount of venture capital invested in the last decade, a record-breaking $643 billion, with a remarkable $329.5 billion of that invested in the US alone. Some of the biggest deals include Amazon reseller aggregator Thrasio, which raised $1 billion in October 2021 and filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, cloud security company Lacework, which raised $525 million in January 2021 then $1.3 billion in October 2021 and was rumoured to be up for sale to Wiz, only for the deal to collapse, and autonomous car company Cruise, which raised $2.75 billion 2021 and was killed off in December 2024. The people who lose their livelihoods ‚Äî those who took stock in lieu of cash compensation, and those who end up getting laid off at the end ‚Äî are always workers, while people like Lacework co-CEO Jay Parikh (who oversaw ‚Äúreckless spending‚Äù and ‚Äúmanagement dysfunction‚Äù according to The Information) can walk into highly-paid positions at companies like Microsoft, as he did in October 2024 a few months after a fire sale to cybersecurity Fortinet for around $200 million according to analysts. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre wrong, or if you run your company badly, because the Business Idiot is infallible, and judged too by fellow disconnected Business Idiots. In a just society, nobody would want to touch any of the C-suite that oversaw a company that handed out Nintendo Switches to literally anyone who booked a meeting (as with Lacework). Instead, the stank remains on the employees alone. It‚Äôs so easy, and perhaps inevitable, to feel a sense of nihilism about it all. Nothing matters. It‚Äôs all symbolic. Our world is filled with companies run by people who don‚Äôt interact with the business, and that raise money from venture capitalists that neither run businesses nor really have any experience doing so. And despite the fact that these people exist several abstractions from reality, the things that they do and the decisions they make impact us all. And it‚Äôs hard to imagine how to fix it. We live in a system of iniquity, dominated by people that do not interact with the real world who have created an entire system run by their fellow Business Idiots. The Rot Economy‚Äôs growth-at-all-costs mania is a symptom of the grander problem of shareholder supremacy, and the single-minded economic focus on shareholder value inevitably ends at an economy run by and for Business Idiots. There is a line, and it ends here ‚Äî with layoffs, the destruction of our planet and our economy and our society, and a rising tide of human misery that nobody really knows where it comes from, and so, we don‚Äôt know who to blame, and for what. If our economy actually worked as a true meritocracy ‚Äî where we didn‚Äôt have companies run by people who don‚Äôt use their products or understand how they‚Äôre made, and who hire similarly-specious people ‚Äî these people would collapse under the pressure of having to know their ass from their earhole. Yet none of this would be possible without the enabling layers, and those layers are teeming with both Business Idiots and those unfortunate enough to have learned from them. The tech media has enabled every single bubble, without exception, accepting every single narrative fed to them by VCs and startups, with even critical reporters still accepting the lunacy of a company like OpenAI just because everybody else does too. Let‚Äôs be honest, when you remove all the money, our current tech industry is a disgrace. Our economy is held up by NVIDIA, a company that makes most of its money selling GPUs to other companies primarily so that they can start losing the money selling software that might eventually make them money, just not today. NVIDIA is defined by massive peaks and valleys, as it jumps on trends and bandwagons at the right time, despite knowing that these bandwagons always come to an abrupt halt. The other companies feature Tesla, a meme stock car company with a deteriorating brand and a chief executive famous for his divorces from both reality and multiple women along with a flagrant racism that may cost the company its life. A company that we are watching die in real time, with a stagnant line-up and actual fucking competition from companies that are spending big on innovation. In Europe and elsewhere, BYD is eating Tesla‚Äôs lunch, offering better products for half the price ‚Äî and far less stigma. And this is just the first big Chinese automotive brand to go global. Others ‚Äî like Chery ‚Äî are enjoying rapid growth outside of China, because these cars are actually quite good and affordable, even when you factor in the impact of things like tariffs. Hey, remember when Tesla fired all the people in its charging network ‚Äî despite that being one of the most profitable and valuable parts of the business? And then hired them back because it turns out they were actually useful? This is a good example of managerial alienation ‚Äî decisions made by non-workers who don‚Äôt understand their customers, their businesses, or the work their employees do. And let‚Äôs not forget about the Cybertruck, a monstrosity both in how it looks and how it‚Äôs sold, and that‚Äôs illegal in the majority of developed countries because it is a death-trap for drivers and pedestrians alike. Oh, and that nobody actually wants, with Tesla sitting on a quarter‚Äôs worth of inventory that it can‚Äôt sell. Elsewhere is Meta, a collapsing social network with 99% of its revenue based on advertising to an increasingly-aged population and a monopoly so flagrantly abusive in its contempt for its customers that it‚Äôs at times difficult to call Instagram or Facebook social networks. Mark Zuckerberg had to admit to the Senate Judiciary Committee that people don‚Äôt use Facebook as a social network anymore. The reason why is because the platform is so fucking rotten, run by a company alienated from its user base, its decrepit product actively hostile to anybody trying to use it. And, more fundamentally, what‚Äôs the point of posting on Facebook if your friends won‚Äôt see it, because Meta‚Äôs algorithm decided it wouldn‚Äôt drive engagement? Meta is a monument to disconnection, a company that runs in counter to its own mission to connect people, run by Mark Zuckerberg, a man who hasn‚Äôt had a good idea since he stole it from the Winklevoss Brothers. The solution to all that ails him? Adding generative AI to every part of Meta, which‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶was meant to do something other than burn $72 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, right? It isn‚Äôt clear what was meant to happen, but the Wall Street Journal reports that Meta‚Äôs AI chatbots are, and I quote, ‚Äúempowered to engage in ‚Äòromantic role-play‚Äô that can turn explicit‚Äù ‚Äî even with children. In a civil society, Zuckerberg would be ousted immediately for creating a pedophilic chatbot, ‚Äî instead, four days after the story ran, everyone cheered Meta‚Äôs better-than-expected quarterly earnings. In Redmond, Microsoft sits atop multiple monopolies, using tariffs as a means to juice flailing Xbox revenue as it invests billions of dollars in OpenAI so that OpenAI can spend billions of dollars on cloud compute, losing billions more in the process, requiring Microsoft to invest further money to keep them alive. All because Microsoft wanted generative AI in Bing. What a fucking waste! While also raising the costs of its office suite ‚Äî which it‚Äôs only able to hold a monopoly on because it acted so underhandedly in the 1990s. Amazon lumbers listlessly through life, its giant labor-abuse machine shipping things overnight at whatever cost necessary to crush the life out of any other source of commerce, its cloud services and storage arm, unsure who to copy next. Is it Microsoft? Is it Google? Who knows! But one analyst believes it‚Äôs making $5 billion in revenue from AI in 2025 ‚Äî and spending $105 billion in capital expenditures. There are slot machines with a better ROI than this shit. Again, it‚Äôs a company that‚Äôs totally exploitative of its customers, no longer acting as a platform that helps people find the shit they need, but to direct them to the products that pay the most for prime advertising real-estate, no matter whether they are good or safe. Let‚Äôs be clear: Amazon‚Äôs recklessness will kill someone, if it hasn‚Äôt already. Then there‚Äôs the worst of them ‚Äî Google. Most famous for its namesake, a search engine that it has juiced as hard as possible, and will continue to juice before the inevitable antitrust sentencing that would rob it of its power, along with the severance of its advertising monopoly. But don‚Äôt worry, Google also has a generative AI thing, for some reason, and no, you don‚Äôt have a choice about using it, because it‚Äôs now stapled onto Google Search and Google Assistant. At no point do any of these companies seem to be focused on making our lives better, or selling us any kind of real future. They exist to maintain the status quo, where cloud computing allows them to retain their various fiefdoms. They‚Äôre alienated from people. They‚Äôre alienated from workers. They‚Äôre alienated from their customers. They‚Äôre alienated from the world. They‚Äôre deeply antisocial and misanthropic ‚Äî as demonstrated by Zuck‚Äôs moronic AI social network comments. And AI is a symptom of a reckoning of this stupidity and hubris. They cut, and cut, and stagnated. Their hope is a product that will be adopted by billions of imaginary customers and companies, and will allow them to cut further without becoming just a PO Box and a domain name. We have to recognize that what we‚Äôre seeing now with generative AI isn‚Äôt a fluke or a bug, but a feature of a system that‚Äôs rapacious and short-term by its very nature, and doesn‚Äôt define value as we do, because ‚Äúvalue‚Äù gets defined by a faceless shareholder as ‚Äúgrowth.‚Äù And this system can only exist with the contribution of the business idiot. These are the vanguard ‚Äî the foot soldiers ‚Äî of this system, and a key reason why everything is so terrible all the time, and why nothing seems to be getting better. Breaking from that status-quo would require a level of bravery that they don‚Äôt have ‚Äî and perhaps isn‚Äôt possible in the current economic system. These people are powerful, and have big platforms. They‚Äôre people like Derek Thompson, famed co-author of the ‚Äúabundance‚Äù agenda, who celebrates the idea of a fictitious version of ChatGPT that can entirely plan and execute a 5-year-old‚Äôs birthday party, or his co-author Ezra Klein, who, while recording a podcast where his researchers likely listened, talked proudly about replacing their work with OpenAI‚Äôs broken Deep Research product, because anything that can be outsourced must be, and all research is ‚Äúlooking at stuff that is relevant.‚Äù And really, that‚Äôs the most grotesque part about Business Idiots. They see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs They boast about how many books they‚Äôve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don‚Äôt play, about the money they‚Äôve raised and the scale they‚Äôve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn‚Äôt matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don‚Äôt want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing ‚Äî living! ‚Äî is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are. They don‚Äôt want to plan their kids‚Äô birthday parties. They don‚Äôt want to research things. They don‚Äôt value culture or art or beauty. They want to skip to the end, hit fast-forward on anything, because human struggle is for the poor or unworthy. When you are steeped in privilege and/or have earned everything through a mixture of stolen labor and office pantomime, the idea of ‚Äúeffort‚Äù is always negative. The process of creation ‚Äî or affection, of love, of kindness, of using time not just for an action or output ‚Äî is disgusting to the Business Idiot, because those are times they could be focused on themselves, or some nebulous self-serving ‚Äúvision‚Äù that is, when stripped back to its fundamental truth, is either moronic or malevolent. They don‚Äôt realise that you hire a worker for the worker‚Äôs work rather than just the work themselves, which is why they don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs so insulting to outsource their interactions with human beings. You‚Äôll notice these people never bring up examples of automating actual work ‚Äî the mind-numbing grunt work that we all face in the workplace ‚Äî because they neither know nor care what that is. Their ‚Äúproblems‚Äù are the things that frustrate them, like dealing with other people, or existing outside of the gilded circles of socialite fucks or plutocrats, or just things that are an inevitable facet of working life, like reading an email. Your son‚Äôs birthday party or a conflict with a friend can, indeed, be stressful, but these are not problems to be automated out. They are the struggles that make us human, the things that make us grow, the things that make us who we are, which isn‚Äôt a problem for anybody other than somebody who doesn‚Äôt believe they need to change in any way. It's both powerful and powerless at the same time ‚Äî a nihilistic way of seeing our lives as a collection of events we accept or dismiss like a system prompt, the desperate pursuit of such efficient living that you barely feel a thing until you die. I‚Äôve spent years writing about these people without giving them a name, because categorizing anything is difficult. I can‚Äôt tell you how long it took for me to synthesize the Rot Economy from the broader trends I saw in tech and elsewhere, how long it took for me to thread that particular needle, to identify the various threads that unified events that are otherwise separate and distinct. I am but one person. Everything you‚Äôve read in my newsletter to this point has been something I‚Äôve had to learn. Building an argument and turning it into words ‚Äî often at the same time ‚Äî that other people will read doesn‚Äôt come naturally to anyone. It‚Äôs something you have to deliberately work at. It‚Äôs imperfect. There are typos. These newsletters increase in length and breadth and have so many links, and I will never, ever change my process, because part of said process is learning, relearning, processing, getting pissed off, writing, rewriting, and so on and so forth. This process makes what I do possible, and the idea of having someone automate it disgusts me, not because I‚Äôm special or important, but because my work is not the result of me reading a bunch of links or writing a bunch of words. This piece is not just 13,000 words long ‚Äî it‚Äôs the result of the 800,000 or more words I wrote before it, the hundreds of stories I‚Äôve read in the past, the hours of conversations with friends and editors, years of accumulating knowledge and, yes, growing with the work itself. This is not something that you create through a summation of content vomited by an AI, but the chaotic histories of a human being mashed against the challenge of trying to process it.

Title: Bitcoin just hit a new record after a long crypto slump

Bitcoin rose to a new record high on Wednesday, surpassing the previous high it hit earlier this year. The world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency hit a peak of $109,359.59 Wednesday morning, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Its previous high-water mark came on President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration day in January. Like many other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin suffered through a prolonged slump in the months between, falling as low as $75,000 in March. Its price has climbed steadily ever since and is up 16% so far in May. The rally comes as crypto becomes more accepted by U.S. regulatory bodies and the broader financial world. JPMorgan Chase (JPM-1.03%) CEO Jamie Dimon announced Monday that its customers will soon be able to buy Bitcoin through the bank. JPMorgan‚Äôs blockchain platform, Kinexys, conducted a test transaction on a public blockchain for the first time last week. On Tuesday, the Senate voted to advance the GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation bill, which would create the U.S.‚Äô first regulatory framework for stablecoins. Trump has said he wants crypto regulation ready to sign by the time Congress takes its August recess. That news could be especially noteworthy for Bank of America (BAC-1.24%): The bank‚Äô CEO Brian Moynihan said in February that Bank of America would issue its own stablecoin if a legal framework for doing so were to be established. In August, Morgan Stanley (MS-1.00%) began allowing its financial advisors to pitch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to certain clients. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told CNBC in January that the bank is looking for ways to get more involved in the crypto market. Earlier this month, Coinbase (COIN-3.06%), the biggest crypto exchange in the U.S., joined the S&P 500 stock index, marking a big moment for the industry. The firm holds a reserve of Bitcoin estimated to be worth $750,000, according to CoinGecko. Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) is also a huge owner of Bitcoin, with an estimated $1.3 billion worth on its ledger.

Bitcoin BTC$110,951.44 became the world‚Äôs fifth-largest asset after hitting a new all-time high on Wednesday, which pushed its market cap to $2.16 trillion. Though the crypto‚Äôs price consolidated lower after hitting a high of $109,400, its market cap passed Amazon (AMZN), which stands at $2.15 trillion. Bitcoin is up 16.44% year-to-date while shares of the online retailer are down about 8% over the same period. It is currently trading at $108,954. Gold is the largest asset, by far, standing at a $22 trillion market cap, followed by Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) which stand at $3.1 trillion to $3.4 trillion respectively. As a result of the surge in bitcoin‚Äôs price since the win of U.S. President Donald Trump, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently became the fifth-largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) by inflows this year as it took in roughly $9 billion from investors, according to data from Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was ‚Äúexpecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúseeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.‚Äù On this news, Elevance‚Äôs stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% ‚Äúdue to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.‚Äù Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance‚Äôs stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company‚Äôs business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants‚Äô positive statements about the Company‚Äôs business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

This Grow a Garden Beanstalks guide tells you if this prismatic plant is the next best Candy Blossom, including its buying price, stock rotation chances, profits, and more! Should you save your money, or splash some cash on this rare seed? Find out in this guide! Start playing Grow a Garden on Roblox. Find out how the Beanstalk fares against other seeds in our Tier List. Or, find out when to check for its stock in our Grow a Garden Stock Guide. The Beanstalk is the first Prismatic rarity seed sold by the merchant on the main island. This puts this plant on quite a pedestal to impress players and make them filthy rich, given it has a 0.0005% restock chance every 5 minutes, and costs an expensive 10,000,000$ to buy a single seed. This seed costs just as much as the event Candy Blossom, which many players (myself included) missed out on. So is the Beanstalk just as profitable? The Beanstalk grows tall and is multi-harvest, meaning you don‚Äôt lose the original plant when you collect it, unlike Bamboo, Mushrooms, etc. An unmutated, average-sized Beanstalk typically fetches for 15-30k cash. It also produces multiple growth points from one stem, and since it grows upwards, it tends not to take up too much garden space. This makes them an excellent crop to harvest and very profitable! To really get your money‚Äôs worth, I recommend not collecting any fully grown Beanstalks for a while until they‚Äôve had the chance to develop mutations. In short, yes, the Beanstalk is likely just as profitable as the Candy Blossom, making this plant meta! The Grow a Garden Discord Server has a channel dedicated to stock rotations, so you won‚Äôt miss out next time the Beanstalk makes a shop appearance. Or, you could buy it for Robux, but where is the fun in that? Copyright 2025 Droid Gamers Inc. - All Rights Reserved. - Privacy Policy

Title: One of Liberation Day's biggest losers is hitting record highs and crossing a key technical level as hedge funds jump in

Time Published: 2025-05-21T15:50:57Z
Full Content:
Industrials were one of the biggest losers of the Liberation Day stock market sell-off, but they've since made an impressive comeback. The sector hit record highs at the start of the week after plunging over 20% in April. Since 1990, only two other periods have seen this level of price appreciation: immediately after the Great Financial Crisis and the pandemic. Industrials are one of the most tariff-exposed areas of the economy. Companies in the sector often rely heavily on global trade and have thin margins that can be easily disturbed by import and export costs. The sector includes companies like GE Aerospace, Boeing, and Uber Technologies. Increased confidence in the economy and trade negotiations, combined with strong performances from aerospace and defense stocks, helped carry the rally. Trump's recent announcement of a $175 billion investment into the Golden Dome missile defense system is also looking like a promising tailwind for the sector. Industrials is the first sector to break record highs after Liberation Day. Institutional investors are buying into the rally, adding more fuel. According to Bank of America, for the week ending May 16, hedge fund net purchases of industrial stocks were at their highest level since 2008. Additionally, 65% of the sector's stocks are trading above their 200-day moving averages, indicating that more stocks are participating in the rally, according to Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. While "sector breadth has notably improved," it's still lower than what it was during previous record highs, Turnquist points out. When the sector was previously trading at all-time highs in late 2024, 80 to 90% of stocks were trading above their 200-day moving average. The percentage of stocks in the sector hitting 52-week highs is also still low, at just shy of 9% this week. LPL Financial remains neutral on the sector, but Turnquist acknowledges that the technical setup is constructive for a continuing rally ‚Äî and could point to cyclical stocks becoming leaders in the overall stock market recovery.

Title: INVESTOR REMINDER: Berger Montague Notifies Elevance Health (NYSE: ELV) Investors of a Class Action Lawsuit and Deadline

May 21, 2025 11:44 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (‚ÄúElevance‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the ‚ÄúClass Period‚Äù). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to ‚Äúredetermine‚Äù whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the ‚Äúredetermination‚Äù process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the cost profiles. Defendants acknowledged rising Medicaid expenses, yet assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company‚Äôs guidance for the year. In truth, however, the redeterminations were causing the utilization of Elevance‚Äôs Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was not adequately reflected in Elevance‚Äôs rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now ‚Äúexpecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.‚Äù In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, ‚Äúdue to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.‚Äù Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024. To learn your rights or for more information, CLICK HERE or please contact Berger Montague: Andrew Abramowitz at aabramowitz@bm.net or (215) 875-3015, or Peter Hamner at phamner@bm.net. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member. Berger Montague, with offices in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Delaware, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago, has been a pioneer in securities class action litigation since its founding in 1970.

Title: Bitcoin ownership surpasses gold in the US as 50M Americans hold BTC
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-ownership-surpasses-gold-in-the-us-as-50m-americans-hold-btc/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T15:13:56Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin has officially outpaced gold in US ownership, marking a significant pivot in the country‚Äôs investment landscape. According to a new report released on 20 May by Bitcoin investment firm River, roughly 50 million Americans now own Bitcoin, compared to 37 million who own gold. This data underscores the rise of Bitcoin as a preferred store of value, reshaping traditional notions of economic security and reserve asset status. As Bitcoin ownership expands, it‚Äôs increasingly seen not just as a speculative instrument, but as a fundamental part of US financial infrastructure. The River report notes that the United States is the global leader in Bitcoin adoption, with 40 percent of all Bitcoin-related companies headquartered in the country. American firms also hold 94.8 percent of all Bitcoin owned by publicly traded companies worldwide, reflecting significant institutional backing. This dominance is supported by a robust ecosystem comprising crypto-focused startups, spot ETF launches, and policies promoting digital asset development. Regulatory momentum in Washington has further strengthened Bitcoin‚Äôs foundation in the financial system. Recent discussions around treating Bitcoin as a potential strategic reserve asset suggest growing political acceptance. Several politicians have floated the idea of the US government maintaining a Bitcoin reserve, signalling institutional confidence amid rising concerns over the US dollar‚Äôs long-term stability. The shift toward Bitcoin is occurring alongside broader macroeconomic concerns. Moody‚Äôs recent downgrade of the US credit rating‚Äîending over a century of top-tier ratings‚Äîhas reinforced the appeal of decentralised alternatives. Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal instability and inflation, particularly given its fixed supply and decentralised governance model. Bitcoin also offers practical advantages over gold in the digital age. The ease of storage, cross-border transfer, and liquidity make it an attractive option for both individual and institutional investors. This is particularly relevant in an era where digital finance is becoming the norm and where traditional safe-haven assets like gold face logistical and accessibility limitations. While Bitcoin is gaining legitimacy as a reserve asset, it remains a volatile asset class. Unlike gold, which has maintained relatively steady valuations over time, Bitcoin has experienced frequent price swings‚Äîsomething that may deter more risk-averse investors. Nonetheless, the market appears to be increasingly tolerant of this volatility, especially as long-term returns continue to outperform traditional assets. Institutional support also plays a key role in this shift. Major asset managers such as BlackRock are incorporating Bitcoin into their portfolios, further validating its status. Meanwhile, crypto ETFs and custodial services are helping to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space, making it easier for Americans to gain exposure to Bitcoin without navigating complex self-custody solutions. As Bitcoin ownership grows, it reflects not just a shift in preference, but a broader transformation in how Americans perceive financial security and resilience. The trend is still developing, but the numbers now place Bitcoin squarely ahead of gold‚Äîat least in terms of how many Americans are betting on it.

by Garry Tan5/21/2025 Over the last few batches, visiting partners Jon Xu and Andrew Miklas have become two of the most trusted voices in the YC community. They were both founders in YC‚Äôs Summer 2010 batch, and now, 15 years and two industry-shaping companies later, they‚Äôre back in a new role: General Partners at YC. As visiting partners, Jon and Andrew have already made a big impact, working closely with hundreds of founders across multiple batches. Now, as full-time General Partners, they‚Äôll play an even bigger role in selecting, advising, and supporting the companies we back. They bring deep technical experience, firsthand startup grit, and a strong track record of helping early-stage companies grow ‚Äì all of which makes them a perfect fit for YC‚Äôs mission to help ambitious founders build enduring companies from the earliest stages. Jon is the co-founder and former CTO of FutureAdvisor (YC S10), one of the first robo-advisors to make quality investment management accessible to a broader consumer audience. After the company was acquired by BlackRock in 2015, Jon continued to lead product and engineering, building an enterprise-grade robo-advisor platform for large financial institutions. His background gives him unique expertise both in building high-trust consumer products and B2B platforms for regulated industries. Andrew co-founded PagerDuty (YC S10, NYSE:PD), which became the backbone of digital operations for thousands of businesses. As founding CTO, he designed the original product and its high-availability architecture, and scaled the engineering team to 70+ people. After PagerDuty, he became an early-stage investor at s28 Capital, supporting companies like Clerk, CaptivateIQ, and Teleport. Andrew brings deep experience in building resilient systems and scaling engineering teams from zero to impact. At YC, we‚Äôre always looking for ways to meet the needs of the most ambitious founders. Adding Jon and Andrew to our team strengthens our bench of technical leaders who‚Äôve built durable companies ‚Äì and who know what it takes to turn early-stage ideas into something world-changing. We‚Äôre lucky to have them, and our founders will be even luckier.

Title: Crypto‚Äôs Market Penetration Tipping Point

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The digital assets market has transformed from a niche experiment into a global force reshaping finance, commerce, and technology. In May 2025, the global crypto market is valued at $3.05 trillion, growing at a pace on par with the internet boom in the 90s. Historical adoption curves for technologies like the internet and smartphones demonstrate that 10% penetration often marks a tipping point, after which growth accelerates exponentially due to network effects and mainstream acceptance. Digital assets are now on this trajectory, driven by rising user adoption, institutional investment and innovative use cases. After years of public uncertainty, a pivotal milestone may be achieved this year: cryptocurrency user penetration can surpass the critical 10% threshold, estimated to reach 11.02% globally in 2025 by Statista, up from 7.41% in 2024. The chart below compares the early user adoption curves of cryptocurrency and the internet. It highlights that crypto is growing at a significantly faster rate than the internet did in its early years. With crypto expected to cross the 10% threshold of adoption in 2025, it is important to note that the 10% mark is not arbitrary ‚Äî- it‚Äôs a well-documented tipping point in technology diffusion, rooted in Everett Rogers‚Äô diffusion of innovations theory. This model shows that adoption shifts from early adopters (13.5%) to the early majority (34%) at around 10‚Äì15% penetration, marking the transition from niche to mainstream. Crossing 10% market penetration triggers rapid growth as infrastructure, accessibility and social acceptance align. Two very recent examples of this are the smartphone and the internet. For cryptocurrencies, surpassing 10% penetration in 2025 would signal a similar inflection point, with network effects amplifying adoption ‚Äî more users increase liquidity, merchant acceptance and developer activity, making crypto more practical for everyday transactions like payments and remittances. In the U.S., 28% of adults (approximately 65 million people) own cryptocurrencies in 2025, nearly doubling from 15% in 2021. Additionally, 14% of non-owners plan to enter the market this year, and 66% of current owners intend to buy more, reflecting significant momentum. Globally, two out of three American adults are familiar with digital assets, signaling a sharp departure from its earlier speculative reputation. These figures underscore the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets, aligning with the post-10% adoption surge observed in other transformative technologies. Crypto‚Äôs economic impact spans remittances, cross-border trade, and financial inclusion, particularly in Africa and Asia, where it empowers the unbanked. Several factors are propelling crypto past the 10% threshold: Institutional and business involvement is accelerating digital assets‚Äô mainstream integration. Major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity are going all in on crypto services and have launched crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with 72 ETFs awaiting SEC approval in 2025. Businesses are adopting crypto payments to cut fees and reach global customers, particularly in retail and e-commerce. Examples include Burger King in Germany accepting bitcoin since 2019 and PayPal‚Äôs 2024 partnership with MoonPay for U.S. crypto purchases. Platforms like Coinbase Commerce and Triple-A, alongside partnerships like Ingenico and Crypto.com, enable merchants to accept crypto with local currency settlements, reducing volatility risks. DeFi activity has increased significantly in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. In Eastern Europe, DeFi accounted for over 33% of total crypto received, with the region placing third globally in year-over-year DeFi growth. Despite its momentum, digital assets face hurdles: Still, the trajectory is promising. Bullish sentiment and crypto-friendly regulators, coupled with ETF momentum and payment integrations, underscore this trajectory. If innovation continues to balance out with trust, digital assets are likely to follow the internet and smartphone playbook ‚Äî and grow even faster.

May 21, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: Lava for Good Lava for Good New York, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NEW YORK, NY - May 21, 2024 - Lava for Good, Adweek's 2024 Podcast Network of the Year, today announced the launch of Absolute, Season 1: Taser Incorporated, the first story in a bold new investigative series that examines how extreme corporate power reshapes American institutions and our everyday lives. Hosted by accomplished writer, director, and journalist Nick Berardini, Absolute, Season 1: Taser Incorporated is a story about unchecked power that threads several storylines into one epic tale of relentless ambition, a utopian vision, and the collision between technology and humanity in the realm of modern law enforcement. Berardini has spent over a decade investigating the history and rise of the Taser and the company behind it, and with Absolute, Season 1: Taser Incorporated, he left no stone unturned. Taser International, now known as Axon Enterprises, is the 800-pound gorilla in the paramilitary police equipment industry. It is led by its charismatic CEO and co-founder, Rick Smith ‚Äî a man with a Star Trek obsession and an ambitious, altruistic vision of a world without killing. As Smith‚Äôs Taser became the ultimate alternative weapon for police, his company became an integral supplier to police across the nation, as presidents from both parties poured millions of taxpayer dollars into the promise of a non-lethal alternative to firearms. But as stories of deaths and serious injuries began to emerge, Taser‚Äôs legal and publicity strategy seemingly turned to blaming police for misuse and victims for health issues rather than focusing on potential flaws in the product itself.Berardini‚Äôs documentary film, Killing Them Safely‚Äîa searing investigation into police weaponry and accountability‚Äîpremiered in World Competition at the Tribeca Film Festival and was produced by Academy Award winner Glen Zipper and Sundance fellow James Goncalves. The film was later acquired by IFC/Sundance Selects and licensed by Netflix and Hulu, earning critical acclaim in Vanity Fair, Newsweek, The Los Angeles Times, Forbes, and The Guardian. "America loves the story of a hungry entrepreneur with a dream," said Berardini. "But when that ambition goes unchecked and success comes at any cost, we must examine the true price being paid ‚Äî and by whom.‚Äù Jason Flom, co-founder and CEO of Lava for Good, commented, "With this terrific debut season of our new Absolute series, we're expanding our investigative focus to examine how increasingly militarized, high-tech policing supplied by powerful private enterprise impacts the criminal legal system in America. This series exemplifies Lava for Good‚Äôs commitment to stories that challenge listeners to question the systems we take for granted."Lava for Good is the network behind award-winning series including Wrongful Conviction and Bone Valley, both of which have been credited with contributing to real-world outcomes, from exonerations and paroles to legislative change. Lava‚Äôs work is distinguished by fearless reporting, deep investigative rigor, and a commitment to centering stories that are too often overlooked. Absolute, Season 1: Taser Incorporated launches May 21 on all major podcast platforms. Episodes 1, 2, and 3 will be available to binge on May 21, with episodes 4, 5, and 6 following on June 4 ‚Äî exclusively on Lava for Good+ on Apple Podcasts.

Title: Nvidia CEO calls Biden's AI chip curbs on China 'a failure' and praises Trump's changes

Full Content:
U.S. efforts to curtail China‚Äôs access to advanced artificial intelligence chips have backfired, Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday, adding that the Biden administration‚Äôs export restrictions didn‚Äôt slow China‚Äôs AI ambitions ‚Äî they accelerated them. Speaking to reporters at the Computex tech conference in Taipei, Huang said years of U.S. restrictions on AI chip exports were a strategic misfire that cost Nvidia billions and handed Chinese rivals a powerful incentive to innovate. ‚ÄúAll in all, the export control was a failure,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúThe local companies are very talented and very determined, and the export controls gave them the spirit, the energy, and the government support to accelerate their development.‚Äù Nvidia, which was once dominant in China with a market share approaching 95% at the start of the Biden administration, now holds just 50%, Huang said. The company has been forced to write off ‚Äúbillions of dollars‚Äù in revenue after repeated rounds of U.S. export controls blocked sales of its most advanced chips ‚Äî even models designed to comply with restrictions. Huang endorsed President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent rescinding of the Biden administration‚Äôs AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed country-based limits on chip exports ‚Äî most notably China, due to national security concerns. ‚ÄúPresident Trump realizes that it‚Äôs exactly the wrong goal,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúIf the United States wants to stay in the lead, and if we would like the rest of the world to build on American technology, then we have to maximize AI diffusion, maximize the speed.‚Äù The Trump administration has paved the way for a series of multibillion-dollar chip sales agreements across the Gulf region, which one analyst said was a ‚Äúwatershed moment‚Äù for Big Tech. Huang accompanied Trump to the Middle East earlier this month, where Nvidia inked deals to supply its top-tier GPUs to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Huang made it clear, however, that Nvidia still sees China as too important to ignore. Last month, he visited Beijing and met with top Beijing officials and the founder of AI firm DeepSeek to discuss chips that could avoid triggering U.S. sanctions, according to The Financial Times. ‚ÄúChina has a vibrant technology ecosystem, and it‚Äôs very important to realize that China has 50% of the world‚Äôs AI researchers, and China is incredibly good at software,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúAI researchers are still doing AI research in China. If they don‚Äôt have enough Nvidia, they will use their own.‚Äù And that‚Äôs already happening. Chinese chipmaker Huawei‚Äôs domestically produced Ascend chips (which remain less capable than Nvidia‚Äôs) are being installed in data centers under state guidance. Washington recently warned that companies using Huawei chips could face penalties under U.S. law, sparking fierce pushback from Beijing and a warning that enforcement of such measures could violate Chinese law ‚Äî potentially putting a halt to the progress the two countries have made recently in trade talks. For now, Nvidia is navigating a geopolitical minefield. It hasn‚Äôt gotten everything it wanted from Trump ‚Äî the company recently took a $5.5 billion hit related to U.S. limits on Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chips to China. But Huang‚Äôs perspective is clear: Isolating China hasn‚Äôt worked, and only a pragmatic, globally inclusive strategy will keep the U.S. ‚Äî and companies such as Nvidia ‚Äî at the front of the AI race. ‚ÄúAmerica is not the only provider of AI technology,‚Äù Huang said.

May 21, 2025 08:46 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc.

Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance‚Äôs Medicaid members. What‚Äôs more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance‚Äôs rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now ‚Äúexpecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúseeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.‚Äù On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, ‚Äúdue to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.‚Äù On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Target‚Äôs problems are escalating | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Target was already facing a very public revolt from some of its most loyal customers. Now it‚Äôs warning about tariffs. The company said Wednesday that sales fell last quarter, driven in part by customer backlash to Target‚Äôs reversal on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Target also cut its guidance as President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs push up costs for the company. Target‚Äôs sales at stores open for at least a year tumbled 3.8% last quarter. Fewer customers visited Target and spent less when they shopped. Target also cut its financial outlook, a sign Target‚Äôs problems won‚Äôt go away quickly. The company expects sales to decline by low single-digits this year. The company announced that it established a multi-year ‚ÄúEnterprise Acceleration Office‚Äù to speed up growth plans, and it reshuffled its executive team. ‚ÄúWe faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs, and the reaction to the updates we shared on (DEI) in January,‚Äù Target CEO Brian Cornell said on a call with analysts Wednesday. Cornell warned of ‚Äúmassive potential costs‚Äù from tariffs, but said the retailer could offset them by diversifying suppliers, adjusting products ‚Äì and hiking prices, if necessary. ‚ÄúWe have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs and price is the very last resort,‚Äù he said. Target‚Äôs stock (TGT) dropped 7% during pre-market trading Wednesday. Target‚Äôs stock has declined 37% over the past year. Cornell acknowledged in a recent email to staff that it has been ‚Äúa tough few months‚Äù between the retail economy ‚Äúheadlines, social media and conversations that may have left you wondering,‚Äù the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. (Target confirmed the email to CNN.) Cornell said Target‚Äôs culture and commitment to staff has not changed. ‚ÄúI recognize that silence from us has created uncertainty, so I want to be very clear: We are still the Target you know and believe in,‚Äù Cornell said. Boycotts over Target‚Äôs DEI reversal hurt Target‚Äôs business. On January 24, days into Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency, Target announced it was eliminating hiring goals for minority employees, ending an executive committee focused on racial justice and making other changes to its diversity initiatives. Target said it had a new strategy called ‚ÄúBelonging at the Bullseye‚Äù and the company remained committed to ‚Äúcreating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities.‚Äù Target also stressed the need for ‚Äústaying in step with the evolving external landscape.‚Äù But the decision angered supporters of diversity and inclusion policies, who felt blindsided by Target. Target had been a champion of diversity initiatives and LGBTQ rights. Customers online protested Target‚Äôs decision and Anne and Lucy Dayton, the daughters of one of Target‚Äôs co-founders, called the company‚Äôs actions ‚Äúa betrayal.‚Äù Target faced a 40-day consumer boycott during Lent led by Rev. Jamal Bryant, a prominent Atlanta-area megachurch pastor, over its DEI rollback. Protestors picketed outside Target headquarters in Minneapolis and other Black leaders such as Rev. Al Sharpton supported boycott efforts. Target came under more pressure than other companies that rolled back DEI policies because Target had gone further in its DEI efforts, and it has a more progressive base of customers than those competitors. On CNN on Wednesday evening, Bryant said that though Target was the first business targeted, it wouldn‚Äôt be the last. He said he is aware of more than 17 companies that have rolled back DEI initiatives. ‚ÄúAnother company is going to be coming on the radar the next couple of weeks,‚Äù he said. Target was a leading advocate for DEI programs in the business world in the years after George Floyd was murdered by police in the company‚Äôs home city of Minneapolis in 2020. Target also spent years building a public reputation as a progressive employer on LGBTQ issues. Tariffs and a consumer slowdown put even more pressure on Target. The chain stocks more nonessential merchandise compared to competitors such as Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST). More than half of Target‚Äôs merchandise is discretionary and is at risk as consumers reign in spending. Around 50% of Target‚Äôs products are also imported from overseas, including an estimated 25% from China, leaving Target in a ‚Äúchallenging position,‚Äù Steven Shemesh, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note Wednesday. Tariffs may force Target to either absorb added costs, hurting its profit, or raise prices on consumers. Home Depot said Tuesday that it plans to keep most of its prices stable, despite Trump‚Äôs tariffs driving costs up. But tariffs may cause Home Depot to increase prices on select items and eliminate some product lines entirely. Walmart said last week that Trump‚Äôs tariffs are ‚Äútoo high‚Äù and it will raise prices on some items, prompting an angry response from Trump. ‚ÄúWalmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,‚Äù Trump said over the weekend. ‚ÄúBetween Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‚ÄúEAT THE TARIFFS,‚Äù and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I‚Äôll be watching, and so will your customers!!!‚Äù CNN‚Äôs Ramishah Maruf contributed to this story. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: This Billionaire Immigrant Is Racing Elon Musk To Connect Your Phone From Space

ByAlex Knapp ByAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. Last September, a crowd of seasoned spectators gathered at Cape Canaveral, Florida, to watch as SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rocket took flight for the 373rd time. But it wasn‚Äôt carrying yet another of Elon Musk‚Äôs Starlink satellites to join the 7,100-plus he has already circling Earth. Onboard instead were five satellites from AST SpaceMobile, a tiny Starlink rival that SpaceX has derided as a ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù in regulatory filings with the federal government. Each was equipped with a 700-square-foot antenna that would unfold in orbit, an early step in establishing a network AST hopes will someday best the incumbent mocking it. The size of these antennas‚Äîand the even larger 2,400-square-foot version that will succeed them‚Äîare key to CEO and founder Abel Avellan‚Äôs plan to win a new market: satellite internet beamed directly to your phone. In contrast to SpaceX, which uses thousands of satellites to connect residences, businesses, vehicles and even the White House to the internet, AST‚Äôs super-large antennas should give it global coverage with just 90 satellites. The company plans to launch 60 into orbit by the end of 2026. Jamel Toppin for Forbes The goal is to keep cellphones connected when out of range of a tower. You‚Äôd be able to make calls even when hiking in a remote area or from a boat miles offshore. Until recently, that required expensive satellite phones with special hardware. ‚ÄúOur vision is to provide connectivity without disadvantage to wherever people are located,‚Äù says Avellan, 54. This isn‚Äôt Starlink‚Äôs main business: Its $12.3 billion in revenue largely comes from providing internet to fixed-base stations attached to homes and businesses, not mobile phones. Nor is it the vision of Jeff Bezos‚Äô Project Kuiper, a direct Starlink competitor, which launched the first 27 of a planned 3,200-plus satellites in late April. But Starlink isn‚Äôt totally ignoring the phone business. It‚Äôs currently in beta testing with T-Mobile to let users text on their phones via Starlink when they don‚Äôt have any bars, giving it an early lead over AST. It also has thousands of satellites, to AST‚Äôs five, and Musk‚Äôs insider status with the Trump administration could prove important in the heavily regulated telecom business. Starlink‚Äôs staggering $350 billion valuation dwarfs Midland, Texas‚Äìbased AST‚Äôs market cap (it went public in April 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company) of around $8.7 billion. Still, AST has a shot at the emerging market for a satellite-based mobile cell plan, with a potentially substantial payoff. The big opportunity is not off-grid connectivity for Europeans and North Americans but providing internet to the more than 2.6 billion people, largely in the developing world, who struggle to get online at all. Most of them can‚Äôt afford Starlink. A basic base station starts at $350; then it‚Äôs around $80 per month for residential Wi-Fi. AST‚Äôs pricing is still largely theoretical, but the startup hopes it can deliver for just a few extra dollars a month on a cellphone bill. That‚Äôs a compelling proposition. When it comes to broadband, ‚Äúthe cheapest and most efficient way is through your phone,‚Äù Avellan says. Skipping out on building new cell towers entirely could mean major cost savings for the telecoms companies as well, if they can offer satellite internet in markets that don‚Äôt yet justify that investment. Deutsche Bank (which is not an AST investor) estimates that the company‚Äôs revenues could top $370 million in 2026 once its commercial service is up and running, and surpass $5 billion by 2030‚Äîwith far less capital expenditure than Starlink will need to keep launching thousands of satellites. The big obstacle for both companies is the basic physics of satellite communication: namely, that you need a direct line of sight from a satellite to your phone to get a signal. Starlink, Project Kuiper and multiple Chinese firms plan to tackle this by flooding the zone with thousands of small, cheap satellites in low Earth orbit, which hop signals between them to maintain steady connections with ground-based dishes. The antenna in your phone is a lot smaller, making it harder to get bandwidth to do more than text. But AST‚Äôs satellites are outfitted with antennas at least 50 times the size of Starlink‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a tricky feat of engineering‚Äîthe centimeters-thick antennas require assembly in clean rooms to be securely packed into satellites at launch; then they‚Äôre carefully unfolded again in orbit. It‚Äôs much more complicated than a Starlink satellite, and each AST satellite costs about $21 million compared to around $1.2 million to build each Starlink bird. But the result is true broadband connectivity. AST‚Äôs five satellites have successfully made video calls with phones on Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten and AT&T networks. AST‚Äôs have a longer lifespan, too, requiring replacement every 10 years compared to five to seven years for Starlink. AST‚Äôs big antennas make broadband-to-cellphone connections easier to pull off, says John Baras, a University of Maryland aerospace engineering professor, because they cover a much larger area and are designed to deliver a signal to devices in motion. Starlink has a bigger challenge making its system work for phones, he says, because it was envisioned as a way to deliver internet to fixed stations on the ground‚Äînot to mobile phones that by definition move around. ‚ÄúStarlink is going to have problems,‚Äù he says. SpaceX did not respond to a comment request. JR Wilson, VP of towers and roaming at AT&T, a major AST investor, compares the tech race between Starlink and AST to the home-video race of the 1980s. ‚ÄúBeta came out first, but it didn‚Äôt have some of the same qualities as VHS,‚Äù he explained, recalling Sony‚Äôs ill-starred format which, despite delivering a better picture, failed because of its high price and short recording times. AT&T plans to start offering satellite connectivity using AST‚Äôs service once it has more satellites in orbit next year. AST currently has deals with dozens of other telecom providers around the world, including Vodafone, Rakuten and Verizon (all investors), offering potential access to around 3 billion subscribers. Partnering with big telecoms offers loads of advantages, says Mike Crawford, an analyst at Los Angeles‚Äìbased B. Riley Securities. By avoiding the home satellite internet market that Starlink dominates, AST doesn‚Äôt have to spend money to attract subscribers or build costly ground infrastructure‚Äîits partners have already done that. Plus, it avoids going head-to-head with giant legacy telecoms. Avellan knows the ins and outs of the industry. Born in Venezuela, he studied engineering before starting his career at the Swedish telecom giant Ericsson. He founded his first company, Emer¬≠ging Markets Communications, ‚Äúwith $50,000 and a pregnant wife‚Äù in 2000, he says, to provide satellite communication services to Africa and the Middle East, as well as cruise and cargo ships. He sold it to satellite company Global Eagle in 2016 for $550 million and used some of the proceeds to found AST the following year. After launching its first demonstration satellite in 2019, AST raised $110 million from Vodafone, Rakuten, AT&T and VC shops like London-based Shift Ventures. In 2021, it went public through a SPAC backed by private equity firm New Providence, raising an additional $462 million. The company‚Äôs stock has more than doubled since then, making Avellan, who owns about 25% of it, worth some $2.1 billion. In March, AST and Voda¬≠fone announced plans for a joint venture spin-out company to offer AST‚Äôs satellite connectivity to mobile operators in Europe and Africa. PATRICK WELSH FOR FORBES By John Buckingham For a more grounded play on soaring demand for connectivity, wireless communications and broadcast tower REIT American Tower should continue to benefit from mobile data proliferation and 5G deployments, while an expan¬≠ding data center segment positions it to profit from the rise of hybrid IT and AI workloads. Meanwhile, shareholders are rewarded with a 3.3% dividend yield to go along with handsome capital appreciation potential from a conservative ‚Äúpicks-and-shovels‚Äù terrestrial player in the tech gold rush. Moody‚Äôs just awarded the company‚Äôs strong balance sheet, citing AMT‚Äôs lea¬≠ding position in the global wireless infrastructure market, predic¬≠table revenue and income, consistently solid fixed charge coverage and excellent liquidity (it‚Äôs also an investor in AST). John Buckingham is a principal of AFAM Capital and editor of The Prudent Speculator. These partnerships also unlock the parts of the radio spectrum that make communications between satellites and phones possible, which are primarily owned by legacy telecoms. Assu¬≠ming regulators greenlight these deals‚Äîincluding a crucial lease from Ligado Networks for a frequency that would give AST‚Äôs data the equivalent of 4G speeds‚Äîits satellites will be able to offer coverage globally. SpaceX can offer only text right now, although obviously that could change. With far fewer partnerships, Starlink is ‚Äúcash-rich but spectrum-poor,‚Äù according to Crawford, the B. Riley analyst. That‚Äôs not surprising, given Musk‚Äôs ruthless approach to business. ‚ÄúSpaceX famously partners with people to the point that they can extract what they want from you, and then they stomp on your face, right?‚Äù industry analyst Chris Quilty says. Still, Musk‚Äôs deep connections to the Trump administration could present an existential challenge to AST‚Äôs burgeoning business. It‚Äôs clear Musk‚Äôs company views AST as a threat. SpaceX has already taken it to the mat over an array of regulatory issues governed by the FCC: spectrum access, space junk, blocking astronomical observations. Those FCC filings are also where SpaceX dismissed AST as a ‚Äúmeme stock.‚Äù It has a point: While shares in AST have gained a total of 172% since it went public, the stock has been on a tear since last May, jumping more than 1,000% at its peak. The company still has virtually no revenue to support its multi¬≠billion-dollar market cap; in 2024, AST spent $300 million but brought in only about $4 million in revenue due entirely to a contract with the Space Defense Agency to build military satellite communications infrastructure. And like all meme stocks, it has a flock of ardent believers online. AST‚Äôs investment community on Reddit has more than 30,000 active subscribers. When the company invited its retail investors to attend the September launch of its satellites, nearly 1,000 showed up. ‚ÄúPeople are enthusiastic about the prospect that no matter where you live or work, you can have broadband,‚Äù Avellan says of the attention. ‚ÄúIf at the same time they can make money by investing and following what we do? Even better.‚Äù

Blackstone, which considers itself to be the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs largest alternative asset manager,‚Äù has dipped its toes into crypto, purchasing shares in BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to a May 20 filing, Blackstone bought just around $1.08 million worth of BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), despite boasting approximately $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of IBIT at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31. The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone‚Äôs Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, as per Google Finance data. This is the first time the asset manager has disclosed investing in anything crypto-related. Despite IBIT‚Äôs outstanding performance, it appears that Blackstone is not yet ready to commit substantial capital to investing in the apex crypto. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that Blackstone has largely steered clear of crypto. Back in September 2019, Blackstone co-founder and CEO Stephen Schwarzman said he liked the blockchain technology but thought its use for money was ‚Äúpretty odd.‚Äù ‚Äú[I was] raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,‚Äù he noted at the time. Schwarzman further admitted he wasn‚Äôt much of a fan of Bitcoin, citing difficulties understanding the technology. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT has drawn in a net inflow of over $46 billion since it went live on Wall Street in January 2024, signaling institutions‚Äô persistent confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects. Bloomberg‚Äôs senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a recent post on X that BlackRock is now the second-biggest Bitcoin holder globally, trailing only the mysterious BTC inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Balchunas believes the asset manager is poised to surpass Satoshi‚Äôs holdings by next summer. The pundit reckons that if the Bitcoin price climbs to $150,000 in the coming months, it could spark a ‚Äúfeeding frenzy‚Äù among financial advisors, which would help BlackRock attain this milestone even more quickly.

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning As the Dublin Airport passenger cap row rumbles on, the Government has been asked to consider a ‚Äúhigh speed bus network‚Äù for the Shannon catchment area as part of a strategy to wrest aircraft traffic from Dublin Airport. As Mark Hilliard reports, in a letter outlining the need for a fundamental rethink of aviation policy across the island, Shannon Airport Group chief executive Mary Considine also argued the west of Ireland terminal would probably see a rail link before the capital. Meanwhile Hugh Dooley reports that three of Ireland‚Äôs regional airports are set to share nearly ‚Ç¨8 million in government funding to fund capital development projects. The funding will support 33 capital investment projects improving the safety and security at Kerry, Ireland West, and Donegal airports, as well as sustainability efforts at a cost of ‚Ç¨7.82m. Thinking about getting a new mortgage? The days of the only option being the big banks are well and truly behind us. In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt takes you through the options. Rent caps have been around in Ireland for a number of years now, and it seems clear that the Government has been looking at ways to replace them. With average rents now over ‚Ç¨2,000 per month, John McManus says the chances of change are next to zero. Ibec has called on the Government to prioritise infrastructure investment over tax cuts or other expenditure. As Hugh reports, the group called on the Government to retain a consistent level of capital investment and drop barriers in the planning system for big ‚Äúcommon good‚Äù projects. Ardagh Group‚Äôs debt restructuring talks to a group of bondholders has broken down amid a standoff over how much Paul Coulson, the packaging giant‚Äôs leading shareholder, will continue to own in its improving drink cans business. Joe Brennan has the latest. Taxpayers paid ‚Ç¨10.3 million for an investigation into a controversial property sale by the National Asset Management Agency (Nama), including ‚Ç¨2.4 million paid to the State organisation itself. Barry O‚ÄôHalloran reports. Infrastructure giants ATM and Alstom are jointly bidding for the ‚Ç¨1.75 billion contract to run Dublin‚Äôs Luas light rail network, the pair confirmed on Tuesday. Barry has the details. The post office network requires funding of ‚Ç¨15 million per year out to 2030 or the Republic faces the prospect of ‚Äúrapid, unrestrained closures‚Äù, which would risk ‚Äúirreparable financial, economic and social harm‚Äù, a report from Grant Thornton has found. Colin Gleeson has the story. Senior Irish bankers said on Tuesday they are not seeing signs of an imminent surge in housebuilding, adding to fears that the Government will miss its housing targets for at least this year and next. Joe has the story. South African insurer Outsurance‚Äòs fledgling Irish business plans to hire a further 100 staff in the next 12 months, bringing its total workforce to 250 as it gains traction in the market. Joe reports. Joe also notes that Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM), Amundi and BlackRock have been selected to manage assets in the State‚Äôs incoming automatic-enrolment pension scheme. Irish-based gaming giant Flutter has narrowly lost out to rival IGT (International Game Technology) in the race to operate Italy‚Äôs main lottery licence, one of the most lucrative lotto franchises in the world. Eoin Burke-Kennedy has the details. Post-tax profits were down at the company behind Riverdance last year by 87 per cent to ‚Ç¨247,065 due mainly to dance company not touring the United States in 2024. Gordon Deegan has read the accounts. In Commercial Property, Ronald Quinlan reports that the Christian Brothers seeking ‚Ç¨12m for a Swords retreat centre and lands. It‚Äôs a 16.6-acre landbank which occupies prime location next to proposed northern terminus of planned Metrolink.

Title: Google unveils AI upgrades at I/O conference amid search challenges

The I/O conference in Mountain View, California, has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI posed a fresh threat to Google's longtime stronghold of organizing and retrieving information on the internet. In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT. Top executives including CEO Sundar Pichai have often cited the pole position of its Gemini class of AI models on public leaderboards, ahead of top models from competitors including OpenAI and Meta. Google and Xreal debut Aura AR Glasses to rival Meta‚Äôs Orion plan Pichai said at the conference: "Over and over, we've been able to deliver the best models at the most effective price point." The Gemini app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, Pichai said. The Alphabet chief also announced other advancements showcasing AI, including an update to the company's Google Meet video conferencing software that would translate meetings between English and Spanish in real time. And Pichai showcased Google Beam, hardware that makes video chats feel like they are taking place in person, in partnership with HP and based on Google's Project Starline. At the same time, with consumer use of AI chatbots maturing, investors will be tracking the degree to which Google is aggressive in disrupting its search advertising business line, which accounted for the majority of the company's $350 billion in 2024 revenue. Earlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari Web browser for the first time. In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, which has for years hovered around 90% by traditional metrics. A Bernstein analyst note this month placed the figure at 65% to 70% when accounting for usage of AI chatbots. Wells Fargo analysts estimated that Google's market share could fall to less than 50% in five years. The analysts cited a behavioral shift drawing consumers toward AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines. Google's market position could be further rocked by the outcome of legal challenges, in particular a pair of antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department, which is seeking the forced sale of parts of the tech giant including its Chrome browser. Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported. In April, Pichai reiterated those spending plans despite market uncertainty around tariffs. Google has injected more AI into its core search engine over the past two years, primarily through AI Overviews, generative AI summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, and AI Mode, an experimental version that leverages AI more intensively to answer complex queries. Tuesday's announcements will likely include further updates to search as well as Google's effort to deliver a "universal AI agent." At last year's conference, the company teased Project Astra, a prototype tool that can talk to users about anything captured on their smartphone camera in real time. The company began experimenting with inserting ads into AI Overviews last May, though it has avoided any radical changes that would rock the boat. Meanwhile, Google is expanding other revenue streams to monetize AI. Last week, the company told Reuters its Google One consumer subscription service had crossed 150 million subscribers helped by "millions" of customers who signed up for a $19.99 per month plan with access to AI capabilities unavailable for most free users.

Title: Uber Launches Exchangeable Bond Deal Featuring Rare Structure
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2025/uber-launches-exchangeable-bond-deal-featuring-rare-structure/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T00:33:33Z
Full Content:
A $1.2 billion exchangeable bond deal announced last week by Uber Technologies reportedly features a rare structure that is appealing to investors and to Uber. The deal is tied to Uber‚Äôs shares in self-driving truck firm Aurora Innovation and includes bonds that turn into equity if the stock exceeds a set price after a set period, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (May 20). The deal allows investors to participate in the upside of Aurora‚Äôs business while limiting the downside, as they could end up with a valuable stake if the price of the shares rises above the conversion threshold, while they can get paid back the par value of the bond at maturity if the stock drops, according to the report. For Uber, the deal provided favorable terms that included zero coupon and a conversion premium above the marketed range, the report said. Uber retains some upside and can defer tax on the gains. Only about 6% of total U.S. convertible debt over the past five years has had an exchangeable bond structure, but that share may increase among companies with solid credit and adequate stakes in other companies, the report said. Uber announced its plans for a private placement of exchangeable senior notes in a May 13 press release. It announced the pricing of the offering in another press release on the same day. ‚ÄúUber intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include strategic investments, although Uber has not designated any specific uses at this time,‚Äù the company said in the first release. Aurora is developing self-driving systems for commercial vehicles like trucks and plans to deploy driverless trucks at scale. When announcing the company‚Äôs first quarter results on May 8, Aurora Innovation Co-Founder and CEO Chris Urmson noted that its self-driving trucks are now hauling commercial freight on Texas roads. ‚ÄúWe are the first company to operate commercial driverless heavy-duty trucks on public roads,‚Äù Urmson said in a press release. ‚ÄúFrom here we‚Äôll focus on proving the promise of the technology, increasing the value of our product for customers and ultimately becoming an essential partner in the freight industry.‚Äù Uber Launches Exchangeable Bond Deal Featuring Rare Structure Google to Partner With Eyewear Brands on AI-Equipped Smart Glasses Keep Raises $78 Million for Financial Platform for Canada‚Äôs Small Businesses Google Unveils Sweeping AI Upgrades Across Search, Android and Cloud We‚Äôre always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Crazy-Good Ticket Deal for Disneyland‚Äôs 70th!
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/costco-ticket-deal-disneyland-70th-anniversary-halloween-christmas-2025/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T23:39:15Z
Full Content:
Disney has released a new deal for Disneyland & California Adventure admission that beats the current general public 70th Anniversary discount, and offers a ‚Äòfully loaded‚Äô Park Hopper ticket with Lightning Lane Multi-Pass & more for a crazy-good price. Here are dates & details about the special offer, plus comparisons to other past & present ticket promos, an assessment of the value proposition, and more. For a limited time, guests can save ~$180 per person (!!!) on the purchase of a 3-Day Disneyland Park Hopper Ticket with Lightning Lane Multi Pass for only $150 per day. This special offer is valid for admission from May 20, 2025 through December 19, 2025, meaning it‚Äôs not just good for the summer of Disneyland‚Äôs 70th Anniversary, but also Halloween and Christmas! This ticket is $449.99 for all ages, and is a fully-loaded three-day Disneyland ticket with the Park Hopper option and LLMP. A standard multi-day Disneyland ticket with the same add-ons would cost $601 directly from Disney. Even the current 3-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $546 with the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi Pass, making this fully-loaded deal ~$100 off that discounted price in an apples to apples comparison. As an added bonus, this new 70th deal includes a $30 Disney Dining Gift Card that can be used throughout Disneyland Resort! Of course, that assumes you want the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, and that you will eat a meal of food in the parks. It also assumes you want to visit Disneyland and DCA for three days, as opposed to longer. The 4-day version of the general public anniversary deal‚Äìwhich is the one Disneyland has been ‚Äúpushing‚Äù guests towards by virtue of its superior per day pricing‚Äìcosts $400 total or only $100 per day, making that the better deal if you‚Äôre looking for bottom-dollar pricing. However, that is very obviously not an apples to apples comparison. Once you include the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, the 4-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $623, or $155.75 per day. This ticket deal still comes in below that, at $150 per day (and again, includes that bonus $30 dining card). Of course, there‚Äôs a catch (isn‚Äôt there always?). This $449 fully-loaded Disneyland ticket deal is only available at Costco, while supplies last. Moreover, it‚Äôs only being sold in-store in select West Coast markets throughout California, as well as stores in Oregon and Washington. At present, it‚Äôs not available at stores in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, or beyond. (It comes up on an inventory check as either ‚Äúsold out‚Äù or ‚Äúno match found.‚Äù) We paid a visit to our local Costco in Orange County, where there‚Äôs a huge display and a total stock of 200 of these discounted Disneyland tickets. There was also a Costco employee lingering around the display, offering her ‚Äúpitch‚Äù for the special offer. I kinda felt like Ron Swanson as she broke things down for me, but I politely bit my tongue and quietly listened to the spiel, which was mostly accurate-ish! Here‚Äôs the fine print on the Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal: Tickets valid for use beginning May 20, 2025 and expire December 19, 2025. Tickets may be used on nonconsecutive days. A ticket must be used by the same person on all days. Each ticket is valid for three (3) days of admission to both Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park, including visits to both Parks on the same day. Each day of use constitutes one full day of use. Tickets are nonrefundable, may not be sold or transferred for commercial use and exclude activities/events separately priced. Offer may not be combined with other ticket discounts or promotions. Subject to restrictions and change or cancellation without notice. To enter a park, both a theme park reservation and a valid ticket for the same park on the same date are required. Check park availability by visiting disneytraveltradeinfo.com/dlrcalendar prior to purchase. Theme park reservations are limited, subject to availability, and are not guaranteed. Guests with a Park Hopper ticket must make a park reservation for the first theme park they wish to visit to begin their day; then they can cross over and switch between parks on the same day after 11:00 AM (subject to availability). The ability to visit the other park will be subject to that park‚Äôs capacity limitations, operational hours, closures and other restrictions, and is not guaranteed. One (1) $30 Disney Dining Card for each 3-Day Park Hopper Ticket purchased. Value of Disney Dining Card may not be applied toward the ticket price. Disney Dining Card is nonrefundable and redeemable only for food and beverages at participating locations within the Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort and other Disney Resorts located in the U.S. Certain parks, attractions, services, experiences and offerings may be modified, limited in availability or unavailable, and are subject to restrictions, and change or cancellation without notice. Park admission and offerings are not guaranteed. Select shows, performances, and experiences, including parades and nighttime spectaculars, will temporarily pause to make way for seasonal entertainment offerings, then resume at later dates. Check entertainment schedules before visiting. If the new Costco Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer isn‚Äôt for you due to travel dates or because you need longer duration tickets, see our 2025 Discount Disneyland Ticket Buying Guide for additional recommendations. There are a few notable details about this Costco ticket deal to which we want to draw your attention. First, this special offer does not have a ‚Äúfuse,‚Äù which means you can use the first admission this summer for the 70th kickoff, once again between August and October for Halloween Time (see our Guide to Halloween Time at Disneyland), and then one final visit during Holiday Time at Disneyland (see our Guide to Christmas at Disneyland). Those are just examples‚Äìyou could do all three days next week, during our favorite week of the year, or from December 17-19, 2025. Second, this Costco ticket deal has a longer eligibility window than we‚Äôve seen for any ticket deal in recent memory. And by ‚Äúrecent memory,‚Äù I mean since 2016 when we started tracking these discounts. (It was back then that Costco offered a special DCA-only Annual Pass. Unsurprisingly, it was cheaper than this‚Äìbut almost everything was a decade ago!) It‚Äôs unprecedented for a ticket deal like this to cover summer, Halloween and Christmas. It‚Äôs also unprecedented for a discount to encompass several popular holidays without blockouts. Fall Break/Columbus Day, Halloween, Veterans Day, and Thanksgiving are all fair game. You can use this through the third week in December, right before peak Christmas week crowds descend upon Disneyland. For reference, the current Disneyland Anniversary Ticket offer runs now through August 14, 2025. Given the early end of that offer (coupled with this Costco deal), we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a special offer for late August through December 2025‚Äìbut we also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs targeted at Californians, more expensive than this, or doesn‚Äôt cover all of these dates. Finally, it‚Äôs unclear whether this Costco deal is pulling park reservations from the same ‚Äúbucket‚Äù as the new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer or from regular full-price park tickets. Our assumption is the 70th promo. This is exactly how Magic Keys already work, as well as other recent ticket promos. So it‚Äôs really nothing new. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs important to understand because these ticket deals are popular‚Äìthey always are, and that‚Äôs even when they‚Äôre just for California residents. This is more akin to last summer‚Äôs general public ticket deal, but being rolled out at the start of Disneyland‚Äôs 70th Anniversary. It thus stands to reason that this deal will be bought by a higher percentage of guests, meaning more people in this ‚Äúpool‚Äù competing for the same reservations. As Disney warns, some dates are going to be difficult to book‚Äìeven when availability is wide open for other ticket types. The good news is that Disneyland does reallocate reservation availability as demand dictates; the bad news is that they aren‚Äôt very good at it, and it can be very hit or miss (requiring a strong refresh game). Anyway, just bringing this to your attention because we know some people gloss over the terms and conditions, viewing that as CYA legal language that has no real bearing on the deal. Here, that‚Äôs only partially true. The way this new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer works with park reservations is a typical legal disclaimer to avoid (another) lawsuit, but it‚Äôs also crucial for you to understand so you don‚Äôt end up with tickets you can‚Äôt use. The biggest impediments to this Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal at Costco will presumably be a membership to the big-box warehouse store. If you‚Äôre more of a Sam‚Äôs Club house, this does you no good. Even if you are a Costco member, you might have issues purchasing this if you live outside of California, Washington or Oregon since it‚Äôs in-store only. When we asked an employee, they did indicate that inventory was limited and their store had received an initial stock of 200 tickets. They were unsure if the deal would be restocked, or if this was it‚Äìand it was over once it sold out. Waiting until you arrive in California for your vacation to buy these discounted tickets at Costco is a gamble. Not only because they might already be sold out, but because park reservations are required and those might be gone. If you‚Äôre a Costco member living on the West Coast and this special offer is available at your local store, this deal is pretty much a no-brainer. But if not, you might want to consider the current general public deal instead. As a reminder, the general public Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is available now through August 14, 2025. You can purchase tickets directly from Disney or buy this deal via Get Away Today with even greater savings. Here‚Äôs a pricing breakdown and other important details‚Ä¶ 3-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $120 Per Day 4-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $100 Per Day In a normal year, there are two main types of ticket deals. There‚Äôs the summer one, which has morphed from a Golden State deal for all Californians to a general public discount in the last two years. Historically, the summer deal with the wider eligibility pool costs more. Before that, there‚Äôs the winter and spring special offer‚Äìwhich ran this year until May 15, 2025‚Äìthat‚Äôs only available to Southern California residents. Disneyland has done this consistently for at least the last decade. It‚Äôs the much more established and longstanding deal‚Äìthe summer discount is more recent addition during the post-reopening era. This year‚Äôs version of that SoCal resident deal is the best we‚Äôve seen in a while, and is actually better than last year‚Äìand significantly so. It offers discount admission for as low as $67 per day on select days with the purchase of a 3-day, 1-park per day ticket. That deal beats this Costco in terms of bottom line price (which we assume matters to at least some degree if you‚Äôre in the market for discounted tickets), but not on an apples to apples basis once accounting for Park Hopping and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass. Since this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is unlike anything that came before it, I‚Äôm just going to share special offer ticket prices from the last several years and let them speak for themselves‚Ä¶ 2025 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 All Guest Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2021 California Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2020 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2019 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2018 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2017 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2016 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: Ultimately, this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is a crazy-good deal if you‚Äôre at least semi-local and wanting to make a few visits to Disneyland and Disney California Adventure for the 70th Anniversary, Halloween, and Christmas. (For recommendations on when to do DLR, see our list of the Best & Worst Weeks to Visit Disneyland in 2025 & 2026.) That‚Äôs especially true if you want or need all of the bells and whistles on your admission, as this degree of discount is unprecedented in the last decade or so. What amounts to around $180 off per ticket is a tremendous savings, even if it does require buying the fully-loaded option with all of the add-ons. If you want longer duration tickets, live outside the West Coast, aren‚Äôt a Costco member, or are more concerned with getting the bottom-dollar price, there are better alternatives for you. Regardless, it‚Äôs great to see a discount that‚Äôs this aggressive, and better that what Disney is offering directly. This is surprising to see right as the 70th starts, and suggests that more deals are in the pipeline! Planning a Southern California vacation?

Hearing your feedback‚Äìeven when you disagree with us‚Äìis both interesting to us and helpful to other readers, so please share your thoughts below in the comments! Thanks for the tip, I was about to spend $1858 for 4 x 2 day tix with park hopper and LL so not only do I save some money, but get an extra day for future use and $120 in dining gift cards. The first Costco I went to was already sold out (this was yesterday and evening) but that store was able to locate other stores nearby that still had some. They only got 100 of them. Thanks for sharing your experience! It‚Äôs interesting to me that some stores received such little inventory‚Äìreally curious as to whether this will be restocked, or if it‚Äôs gone-gone once it sells out. If the latter, this deal will be dead by Memorial Day. Confirming that at least 1 Costco in WA was restocked today. This is two years in a row where I‚Äôve scrambled to buy tickets from reputable third party companies when price hikes are announced only to see much, much better deals come later on (last year was WDW but this time it‚Äôs DLR.) Regrets. Is there any strategy on *when* to buy tickets? After this happening two years in a row, I think I‚Äôm going to avoid the price hike rush and just put off purchasing as long as I can‚Ä¶I think. ‚ÄúIs there any strategy on *when* to buy tickets?‚Äù Up until the last two years, the optimal strategy was buying before the price increase. And at least for Disneyland, Get Away Today would match future prices if there was a discount that was better. (That‚Äôs not going to happen here, as this deal is not direct-from-Disney.) The smart approach is still buying pre-price increase IMO. But clearly, it‚Äôs not always going to work out to be the lowest price on all tickets. Does anyone know about who is allowed to use the purchased tickets? My wife and I who live in Pennyslyvania are planning to visit our California friend. If she picks up the Costco deal for herself and us, would we be able to use it if we are not the original purchaser or Costco members? There‚Äôs no residency restriction! What you‚Äôre describing would work perfectly fine! I am so disappointed that these are only offered in person. We have a trip planned for June with 6 of us for 3 days and this deal would save us over $700. I can‚Äôt take the gamble that they (and park reservations ) would be available when we land and I don‚Äôt know that I could trust sending someone over $2500 to get us some. Unfortunately we‚Äôll just have to go through Disney and spend the extra $700 that could have helped elsewhere. Roberta, your Costco app has an option to search the inventory in your local warehouse. I would try that on all the Costco‚Äòs within a 50 mile radius of you. It shouldn‚Äôt take longer than 10 minutes, and some posters below are saying they have seen the tickets in non-West Coast Costco‚Äòs. I found these at Costco in Boise so at least some Idaho stores are also included. I think it‚Äôs really important to highlight the non-consecutive restriction more. I asked a friend in CA to buy for me and luckily I caught it before he bought because I‚Äôd have to add an extra night onto my trip to make it work and other people with short trips might not realize. From the way I read it, nonconsecutive is an option, rather than a restriction. That is, it says you ‚Äúmay‚Äù use it on nonconsecutive days (and spread them out however works for you). It doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúmust‚Äù be used on nonconsecutive days, meaning you have no other option. Ah I think you‚Äôre right Lori. Thanks for catching that for me!! This is such a great deal! Hoping they are still available when I can get up to Oregon to buy one. Question: Can these be upgraded to a 4 day, 5 day, etc.? I‚Äôve upgraded before when buying tickets from Get Away Today or others, and it‚Äôs never been a problem. I‚Äôd love to take advantage of the 4 day Anniversary deal, but we‚Äôre not going until the first week of December! (Thanks for the rec on that one Tom, looking forward to the cooler weather and low crowds!) This is an ABSURDLY good deal. Hope Costco doesn‚Äôt run out before we can get over there!! No weekend blackouts? Includes LLMP? Comes with a random $30 gift card? Valid from MAY TO DECEMBER?! The only possible downside is reservation availability, but as long as you book in advance ur chilling. It really is! Our parents don‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúneed‚Äù Park Hoppers or LLMP when they come out to visit, but we‚Äôre still debating getting this over the current ticket deal for them. The big thing for us is the December expiration‚Äìvisiting once this summer, once in October, and once in early December would be fantastic. I just purchased tickets for DL for this June and was shocked at this price savings, $300 less than what I just paid, but then didn‚Äôt feel quite as bad when I read the details. What a fantastic deal if you happen to live in CA! Wow. This is an amazing deal. I wish they‚Äôd make it available across the country because this is about $10 less than I paid for a 2-day Park Hopper with Lightning Lane Multi Pass ticket through Get Away Today for a trip in March and that obviously didn‚Äôt include the dining credit. One element that made last summer‚Äôs deal so much better was that it also included kid‚Äôs prices equivalent to the 50% off tickets offered in the Winter off-season. That made it easily the best publicly available deal in recent memory. This deal is definitely aggressive and I appreciate it. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to get a trip in this year, but if deals keep being this good it‚Äôs at least a little more likely. Thanks Tom!!!

Title: Upfronts 2025 Takeaways & Report Card: Amazon and Netflix Return Strong, Scripted Programming Purged on Broadcast

Music always plays a large role at the annual TV upfronts, as media buyers, journalists, execs and other attendees are ushered in and out of these showcases to loud playlists ‚Äî often spun by celebrity DJs. But this year, one number heard throughout the week came with a hefty dose of irony: Doechii‚Äôs popular track ‚ÄúAnxiety.‚ÄùIn the song, Doechii sings about how her anxiety ‚Äúkeep on trying me / My anxiety, can‚Äôt shake it off of me.‚Äù Perhaps a bit too on the nose for the media congloms to be piping into Radio City Music Hall, the Hammerstein Ballroom and other upfronts venues. After all, no matter how hard media execs try to spin that things are fine ‚Äî that‚Äôs hardly the case: Production is down, budgets keep getting slashed and studios like Paramount Global (still awaiting news on its Skydance merger) continue to be the subject of speculation about their ultimate survival.Anxiety rules this business, and yet, the show must go on. Last week NBCUniversal, Fox, Disney, Amazon, Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix and YouTube all promoted their broad portfolios, with varying degrees of success.Live sports are clearly still the driving factor in the conglomerates‚Äô programming strategies, and movies are part of upfronts now. A decline in scripted programming on the broadcast networks‚Äô fall schedules is a telling sign that the TV business continues to evolve, with some of the biggest scripted bets of next season (like ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù follow-up ‚ÄúThe Paper‚Äù) going to streaming instead of the traditional Big 4.By the end of upfronts week, attendees heard so many competing pitches for their ad dollars that it was hard to keep the messages straight. But here are some of Variety‚Äôs biggest takeaways from the 2025 upfronts. Related Stories VIP+ Xbox Price Hikes Are Make-or-Break Moment for Game Pass Zachary Levi Strikes Back: The Trump-Voting 'Shazam!' Star on Feeling Hollywood's Wrath Over Vaccine Skepticism and the $100 Million Studio He's Building in Austin What Recession? Popular on Variety It‚Äôs an undeniable fact: The entertainment business is in roughfinancial shape. Like the rest of the country, media companies have been affected by President Trump‚Äôs tariffs and general economic upheaval. The Peak TV era, marked by blank checks for massive tentpole productions, is over. Earnings have taken a hit. Layoffs have impacted thousands. Everyone is on the hunt for more cost-effective programming. Of course, you‚Äôd get very little sense of that had you attended the upfronts. Save for a scant few passing mentions, you‚Äôd have no idea that Hollywood is facing these economic choppy times.Martin Short told the audience at Disney‚Äôs presentation that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no tariffs on standing ovations,‚Äù earning a guffaw, while one Fox exec at the Manhattan Center told the crowd, ‚ÄúThe winds of change continue to sweep through our industry and our economy.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs about it for mentions of anything to do with the economy this upfronts week. Understandably, media companies don‚Äôt want to scare advertisers with lots of doom and gloom. Much of TV is about escapism, after all. But completely ignoring reality is not the best policy either.Scripted Purge on Broadcast Scripted programming took a big hit on the broadcast networks this upfronts season. With the release of the fall schedules, nearly all of the major broadcasters have shifted their focus to unscripted programming and sports.The numbers don‚Äôt lie: ABC will have only five hours of scripted programming a week in the fall. Fox will have four. NBC canceled five scripted shows, with virtually no pilots in the works to replace them. CBS was the only network that committed heavily to more scripted shows, but even those were mostly spinoffs (sorry, ‚Äúuniverse expansions‚Äù). Those included ‚ÄúSheriff Country,‚Äù ‚ÄúBoston Blue,‚Äù ‚ÄúCIA‚Äù and ‚ÄúY: Marshals.‚ÄùScripted shows cost more to make, and the broadcast networks aren‚Äôt drawing nearly as many customers as streamers. And there was never any doubt NBC was going to eventize the return of NBA coverage on the network.But if there‚Äôs one thing broadcast can do well, it‚Äôs weekly procedurals and broad comedies. Both formats continue to be popular, but the networks don‚Äôt seem in any rush to find the next big show.One thing‚Äôs for sure ‚Äî the nostalgia reboot/revival wave has officially crashed. NBC axed ‚ÄúSuits LA‚Äù after just one season, despite the original show‚Äôs massive streaming success. The network also canceled the ‚ÄúNight Court‚Äù follow-up with Melissa Rauch and John Larroquette after three seasons, even though it started out strong in the ratings. Maybe it‚Äôs time for some original ideas to get their time in the spotlight? What‚Äôs in a Name? Whomever media companies are paying to come up with the names for new platforms deserves either a raise or a demotion. A major theme of the upfronts was branding or rebranding (or re-re-branding, in one case) with names that lacked creativity.Among the top stories of the week, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed that Max would be known as HBO Max ‚Ä¶ again. Two years after the David Zaslav regime dropped the HBO part of its streaming service‚Äôs name, HBO boss Casey Bloys announced onstage that ‚ÄúHBO Max‚Äù was back ‚Äî earning a wide range of reactions, from laughter to applause. It could have been worse. They could have gone with Max+.Meanwhile, Disney unveiled its ESPN streaming service, which will be called ‚Ä¶ ESPN. The streamer will offer an unlimited plan that includes all ESPN networks and ESPN broadcasts on ABC for $30 a month. The irony is, that‚Äôs more than is currently offered on ESPN+. As Jimmy Kimmel put it during his annual upfront roast, ‚ÄúThe plus is now, in many ways, a minus.‚ÄùFinally there is Versant, the spinoff of NBC-Universal that will house cable brands like USA Network, Syfy, E!, CNBC and MSNBC. Aside from the fact that no one can tell you what ‚ÄúVersant‚Äù means, the name lacks the pop of SpinCo, the moniker the company used before someone landed on its official name.‚ÄúWe Come to This Place for Ad Sales‚Äù It‚Äôs official ‚Äî movies are as much a part of upfronts as TV. While upfronts were once exclusively about television shows, feature films now play a major role in media company pitches to advertisers.NBCUniversal, for the second year in a row, spent a lot of time talking up ‚ÄúWicked‚Äù and its sequel, ‚ÄúWicked: For Good.‚Äù Donna Langley, chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios, and director Jon M. Chu both took the stage to hype the sequel and reveal trailers and a musical special coming to NBC. Not only that, but ad sales chief Mark Marshall made his entrance from the rafters dressed in a Glinda-inspired pink suit.Amazon‚Äôs upfront featured appearances by John Cena, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who talked up their upcoming films with Prime Video. Courtenay Valenti, Amazon‚Äôs head of theatrical and streaming film, hit the stage to delve into the film slate. She talked about Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúThomas Crown Affair‚Äù reboot with Michael B. Jordan ‚Äî with Jordan himself coming out to reveal a series spinoff of the ‚ÄúCreed‚Äù film franchise.Over at the Warner Bros. Discovery upfront, the company devoted a big portion of its presentation to James Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios. In fairness, that included DC TV shows like ‚ÄúPeacemaker‚Äù Season 2 and the upcoming ‚ÄúLanterns,‚Äù but it also had Gunn, Safran and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal revealing a brand-new trailer for Gunn‚Äôs ‚ÄúSuperman‚Äù movie.While companies are all about showing off their entire portfolios to advertisers, it‚Äôs still jarring to see that TV is only a portion of the upfronts experience now. Sports, Sports, Sports Sports programming has always been a major factor at the upfronts, but never more so than now. Linear TV still has the edge when it comes to live sports, and outlets like NBC are making the most of that. The broadcaster made its 11- year deal for NBA and WNBA rights a central part of its upfront, bringing out multiple current stars and revealing that Michael Jordan will be part of the network‚Äôs basketball coverage.Other traditional TV outlets, in an effort to stave off live sports gains made by streamers, have gone all in not just on major players like the NFL, the NBA and the NHL, but also on basically any sports rights deal they can get their hands on. College-level sports of all kinds and smaller leagues got their time in the spotlight. But streamers made their sports presence felt more than ever. YouTube will livestream an NFL game for free in 2025. Amazon and Netflix announced major games for ‚ÄúThursday Night Football‚Äù and the Christmas Day doubleheader, respectively. Netflix got NFL commissioner Roger Goodell onstage (in a Santa coat, no less) to announce the 2025 Christmas surprise.Of course, not all the sports moments were highlight reel-worthy. At Fox‚Äôs presentation, Tom Brady somehow missed an easy pass to Rob Gronkowski, with the ball sailing into the crowd, while Blake Griffin got smoked in a Pop-a-Shot shoot-off against former NFL star Ryan Fitzpatrick Upfronts Report Card Amazon Grade: ABest star moment: Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger going off scriptBest pitch: Michael B. Jordan revealing ‚ÄúCreed‚Äù spinoff series ‚ÄúDelphi‚ÄùBest use of music: Lizzo performing ‚ÄúAbout Damn Time‚Äù liveWorst use of jargon: ‚ÄúFull funnel advertising‚ÄùBiggest bet on a show: ‚ÄúSpider-Noir‚Äù Amazon made its presence felt in a big way for the second consecutive year, boasting A-list star power with memorable moments (like Schwarzenegger hogging the stage until Curtis finally pulled him off) that fired up the crowd. Disney Grade: ABest star moment: Jimmy Kimmel auctioning naming rights to his grandchildBest pitch: ‚ÄúAlien: Earth‚Äù taking over the roomBest use of music: The Manning brothers‚Äô song and dance numberWorst use of jargon: ‚ÄúOur Disney Compass platform is live and advancing privacy-focused data collaboration.‚ÄùBiggest bet on a show: ‚ÄúAlien: Earth‚Äù Disney knows how to put on a show. The Mouse House organized a tightly run presentation boasting a range of stars from across its entire portfolio, complete with musical numbers, ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù droids and Kimmel roasting everyone and everything. Fox Grade: C-Best star moment: Michael Strahan picking up David LettermanBest pitch: YA/Gen Z crowd‚Äôs obsession with TubiBest use of music: Jamie Foxx restarting a song because the crowd wasn‚Äôt energeticWorst use of jargon: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lean-forward experience‚ÄùBiggest bet on a show: Biblical limited series ‚ÄúThe Faithful‚Äù Fox kept things to a relatively short 90 minutes, which may not have been too difficult given its lack of scripted programming and overabundance of Fox News. And condolences to whoever got drilled by that errant football courtesy of Tom Brady. NBCUniversal Grade: BBest star moment Michael Jordan appearing (via video) to announce involvement in NBA on NBCBest pitch ‚ÄúWicked‚Äù taking center stage for the second year in a rowBest use of music John Tesh playing ‚ÄúRoundball Rock‚Äù with an orchestraWorst use of jargon Stop trying to make ‚ÄúVersant‚Äù happen, NBCU. As Seth Meyers joked, it sounds like a medication, not a media organization.Biggest bet on a show NBA on NBC NBCU‚Äôs presentation took two hours and felt even longer. But the company had a lot to promote (including fan favorites BravoCon and ‚ÄúWicked‚Äù), and shout-out to Mark Marshall for risking his life with his flying entrance. Netflix Grade: ABest star moment: Jerry Jones going way off scriptBest pitch: Jude Law and Jason Bateman teasing ‚ÄúBlack Rabbit‚ÄùBest use of music: ‚ÄúThunderstruck‚Äù featuring the Dallas Cowboys cheerleadersWorst use of jargon: ‚ÄúOur biggest titles ‚Ä¶ are not just shows anymore. They‚Äôre vibes.‚ÄùBiggest bet on a show: ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù final season Netflix put on a much heftier showcase of its new and returning offerings than it did last year. The presentation ran barely 80 minutes, but packed in a ton of info and news. Warner Bros. Discovery Grade: B-Best star moment: Conan O‚ÄôBrien frantically pitching the NEO ad platformBest pitch: Conan O‚ÄôBrien frantically pitching the NEO ad platformBest use of music: Guns N‚Äô Roses‚Äô ‚ÄúPatience‚Äù in the ‚ÄúTask‚Äù trailerWorst use of jargon: ‚ÄúWe believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition.‚ÄùBiggest bet on a show: ‚ÄúDancing With Sharks‚Äù (yes, that‚Äôs a real show) Warner Bros. Discovery was doing well at first, but its event went on too long. Maybe Tony Shalhoub didn‚Äôt need to hype his bread show? This upfront also definitely lacked the razzle-dazzle and star power of years past. YouTube Grade: B-Best star moment: Lady Gaga‚Äôs rollicking five-song setBest pitch: Creator Brittany Broski saying her BroskiReport podcast channel has ‚Äú1 million subscribers who never hit the ‚ÄòSkip ad‚Äô button‚ÄùBest use of music: Chappell Roan‚Äôs ‚ÄúPink Pony Club‚Äù as CEO Neal Mohan‚Äôs walk-on songWorst use of jargon: ‚ÄúCulture,‚Äù as in YouTube is ‚Äúthe epicenter of culture‚Äù YouTube had only one major piece of content news to share: Its rights deal with the NFL to livestream a free game in the 2025 season. They did a good job of showcasing new ad formats, creators and marketing results. And Gaga‚Äôs performance brought down the house.

"AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure‚Äîjust like the internet, just like electricity‚Äîneeds factories," Huang told the audience. "You apply energy in, and it produces something incredibly valuable: tokens." The company introduced the idea of these data centers as new "AI factories," reimagining their purpose as facilities specifically optimized for artificial intelligence workloads. As a first step toward significant expansion, Nvidia announced NVLink Fusion, opening its "interconnect" technology to other manufacturers. This system enables customers to integrate processors from other companies alongside Nvidia's GPUs. "A tectonic shift is underway: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected‚ÄîAI is being fused into every computing platform," Huang said in an official press release. "NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures." This development is particularly significant as it provides developers with more hardware choices, even from third-party providers, for training their models. Companies can now build semi-custom AI systems tailored to specific workloads, optimizing for cost, performance, or specific architectural advantages. Partners including MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip Technologies, Astera Labs, Synopsys, and Cadence are among the first to adopt this technology. Another important development, announced separately from Computex, is that Nvidia expanded its partnership with Neocloud providers. Such providers focus almost exclusively on renting high-end GPUs, such as NVIDIA‚Äôs H100, H200, A100, and upcoming Blackwell chips, for AI-specific workloads like training large language models (LLMs), computer vision, and inference. Some of these new ‚Äúcloud partners‚Äù include CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, and Lambda. As part of its vision of establishing ‚Äúsovereign AI‚Äù development, the company announced partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop massive infrastructure for AI training and deployment, mainly driven as part of Trump‚Äôs chip accords. The market has responded positively to these announcements, with Nvidia's stock growing almost 60% since its dip on April 7. On Monday, though, the stock was relatively stable‚Äîas it has been for the last 4 days‚Äîgoing from $132.39 to $135.35. NVDA finished Tuesday's trading day just below the $135 mark. Nvidia also emphasized that NVLink enables compatibility between Qualcomm processors and Nvidia GPUs. This could lead to AI computers featuring energy-efficient CPUs paired with Nvidia's high-performance GPUs, or even mobile hardware with Nvidia GPUs for faster inference and enhanced gaming experiences. The company also revealed plans for a new local headquarters called Nvidia Constellation in Taipei's Beitou Shilin Science Park. Nvidia is also expanding to Taiwan, where the company plans to expand its quantum operations. For individual developers, Nvidia introduced DGX Spark, a compact AI workstation built by partners including ASUS, Dell, and MSI. Powered by the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, it offers 1,000 AI TOPS with 128GB memory, supporting models up to 200 billion parameters. Just for context, Nvidia‚Äôs most powerful consumer GPU, the RTX 5090 packs up to 32GB of memory, and starts at $2,499. "Direct descendants of the DGX-1 system that ignited the AI revolution, DGX Spark and DGX Station are created from the ground up to power the next generation of AI research and development," Huang noted. Reservations for the DGX Spark start at $3,999 per unit. Addressing concerns about AI's impact on employment, Huang presented a different perspective. Rather than causing a job crisis, he sees AI as the solution to an impending workforce shortage. "We'll have a shortage of workers by 2030‚Äîabout 30 to 50 million people short. It's actually limiting the world's ability to grow," Huang said. "Now we have these digital agents that can work with us. One-hundred percent of Nvidia software engineers now have digital agents working with them to help develop better code more productively." Looking further into the future: "The reason why humanoid robotics are so important is because it is the only form of robot that can be deployed almost anywhere," he said, adding that ‚Äúthis whole new industry is going to expose us to giant opportunities ahead."

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Elon Musk has been the center of the media landscape for the past few hours, courtesy of the near-constant trickling of tantalizing soundbites. Now, the world's richest person has set the proverbial tongues wagging by expressly stating that his political engagements with the Trump White House will continue. ELON INTERVIEW AT QATAR FORUM ‚Äì FULL VERSION Here's the full interview with Elon Musk at the Qatar Economic Forum a few minutes ago. Timestamps: 0:44 A typical week for Elon1:40 Tesla‚Äôs situation has already turned around3:55 Elon's compensation important to control Tesla‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/G3SxPgBEdP ‚Äî ELON CLIPS (@ElonClipsX) May 20, 2025 Elon Musk recently gave an expansive interview on the sidelines of the Qatar Economic Forum. Interestingly, Musk conveyed a sense of optimism around Tesla's demand equation, asserting that the EV giant has "already turned around," with lingering weakness reserved for Europe alone. Bear in mind that Tesla sales declined around 10 percent year-over-year in Q1 2025, as the launch of a refreshed version of Model Y idled factory capacity for retooling, and Musk's political role at the White House prompted a partisan backlash. Meanwhile, in Europe, Musk's emphatic support for the far-right AfD in the recent German elections also led to widespread calls for a boycott. ELON MUSK: PLANS TO BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE COUPLE OF DAYS EVERY FEW WEEKS ‚Äî Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Now, additional soundbites from Elon Musk are adding oxygen to the ongoing media frenzy. First, Musk has stated that he still intends to spend "a couple of days" at the White House "every few weeks." This goes against the impression that Musk had conveyed during the Q1 2025 Tesla earnings call, where he implied that his DOGE work was "mostly done." ELON MUSK: DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE PLANS TO MERGE TESLA, XAI MERGING TESLA AND XAI NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION, WOULD NEED SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL ‚Äî Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Next, while not completely ruling out the possibility, Elon Musk has denied the presence of any immediate plans to merge Tesla with xAI. This comes as xAI recently acquired the social media platform X in an all-stock deal that valued the former at $80 billion and the latter at $33 billion, inclusive of $12 billion in liabilities. This meant that the deal bestowed a gross valuation of $45 billion on X before factoring in its debt load of $12 billion. ELON MUSK: EXPECTS TO BUY 'A LOT' OF NEXT-GENERATION GPUS FROM $NVDA, $AMD; ‚ÄúNVIDIA IS STILL BETTER THAN WHAT WE MAKE‚Äù ‚Äî Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Finally, in a nod to NVIDIA's continuing dominance in the AI silicon arena, Elon Musk has declared he expects to buy "a lot" of GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD, going on to note that NVIDIA's offerings are "still better than what we make" in what is an allusion to Tesla's in-house ASICs.

Title: US Ambassador to Israel: 'America is your friend‚Äîwe stand with Israel against evil'
URL: https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/408688
Time Published: 2025-05-20T20:10:15Z
Full Content:
In a defiant and impassioned address in Tel Aviv, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee declared that the alliance between Israel and the United States is not only unshaken‚Äîit‚Äôs indivisible. Speaking to an audience of Israel‚Äôs top economic leaders, Huckabee rejected any notion of drifting ties between the nations. Framing Iran as the common source of regional threats, he vowed unwavering US support for Israel. "To anyone who says that the paths of Israel and the US are going their separate ways, that there is a conflict between them or that they are moving away from each other, I say: that is not what is happening. The only thing that was separated in this part of the world was the Red Sea, when Moses parted it in two to allow the Israelites to pass. I came here today in the name of friendship and gratitude," declared the US Ambassador at a festive reception held in his honor by the Ministry of Finance and the Israel Securities Authority on Tuesday evening, in the presence of the heads of the economy. Huckabee added that he "prays that God will cross the Red Sea again and allow the kidnapped to return home." ‚ÄúI realize that as I stand here tonight there are enemies poised to do any and everything they can to destroy you, to take you down and to take your future and your hope away. But they won't be able to do it. On all sides, whether it's Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis. I've said several times this week, it doesn't matter who brings the plate of hate to Israel to try to destroy you. We know where the kitchen is. The kitchen from which all of these really deadly disease dishes come from is from Iran and you're standing up against this evil monster, who for 46 years has said they're going to destroy you. But then they say once they're finished with you, they come after us. You're the appetizer, we're the entr√©e. Americans need to understand that the reason it matters what you do is because how you handle this threat is how we will ultimately have to handle this threat. Your enemies are our enemies and I hope it's always true that your friends are our friends. I say this from the bottom of my heart, America is your friend. We're your partner. We will stand with you. We must. We can't afford to pay the alimony of the divorce. So I hope you like us; you're stuck with us and I hope Americans will always love you because we feel like we're stuck with you too. God bless you.‚Äù Huckabee emphasized that "we (the US and Israel) are partners, we are not just stakeholders cooperating to advance their own selfish interests. Israel is not just our business partner, we also benefit from Israel's economic strength." He also noted "the strength of the Israeli economy in the midst of war, against all the international pressure, and frankly, against the backdrop of international madness." Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also addressed the strength of relations between the countries: "We believe that the coming period will be a new high in relations between Israel and the US: an economic partnership that will bring more investments and more cooperation, regional moves that will position Israel as a strategic center connecting the Middle East, Europe and Asia, and an ideological infrastructure of a connection between tradition and innovation and freedom." Smotrich noted that Huckabee is "not just an ambassador of a country but a true friend" of Israel. "The Israeli economy has stood a huge test and emerged from it stronger than ever," said Smotrich. "The Israeli shekel is stronger today than on the eve of the war. This is not just the result of market trends - it is an international expression of confidence in the strength of Israeli society, in our political stability, and in the economic policy we are leading. The Israeli stock exchange has provided some of the highest returns in the world, thus proving that despite the war - the future here is bright. Investors understand better than politicians and commentators and they believe in Israel and the fast future that awaits it. And they are right.. The Chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, Seffy Zinger, said that "one of the main factors for the strength of the Israeli capital market is its deep integration with global markets, and especially with the American capital market. The financial ties between us are deep and strong." Zinger recounted a recent meeting in the US with American investors: "What particularly caught their attention was the performance of the Israeli stock exchange compared to global markets. The Tel Aviv-125 index yielded a return of almost 30% in 2024, almost as much as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices. This is an especially impressive achievement, given the fact that it took place during the most difficult and complex war in Israel's history. I told those investors: Don't invest in Israel just out of love. Invest in it because it's a good investment." In addition to Smotrich and Zinger, the event was attended by other heads of the economy, including Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron, Finance Ministry Director General Ilan Rom, Israel Stock Exchange Director General Itai Ben Ze'ev, Competition Authority Director Michal Cohen, Capital Market Authority Commissioner Amit Gal, Bank Leumi CEO Hanan Friedman, Phoenix CEO Eyal Ben Simon, Zvi Stepak, co-owner of the investment house Meitav-Dash, BlackRock Israel CEO Anat Levin, venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg, co-founder of the Aleph Fund, businessman Gideon Tadmor, Bank of Jerusalem CEO Yair Kaplan, and former minister and venture capitalist Yizhar Shai, whose son Yaron Shai fell on October 7, and who decided to leverage the pain to establish 1,500 startups to commemorate those murdered and fallen on October 7 and in the Swords of Iron War.

Title: BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT becomes second-largest Bitcoin holder behind Satoshi Nakamoto

BlackRock's IBIT poised to potentially overtake Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin holdings by next summer. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become the second-largest holder of Bitcoin as of May 20, surpassed only by the infamous wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the flagship crypto. According to data compiled by crypto analyst Shaun Edmondson, IBIT currently holds 636,108 BTC, representing over 3% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total capped supply of 21 million and nearly 57% of Nakamoto‚Äôs estimated 1.12 million BTC stash. With this, BlackRock now holds more Bitcoin than Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, and Strategy, the largest corporate holder of the bellwether asset. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that, depending on how Bitcoin performs in the market, the ETF‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings could overtake Satoshi‚Äôs by next summer. He added that the timeline could accelerate if the asset‚Äôs price approaches $150,000. He said such a surge might prompt widespread institutional demand, particularly from financial advisors reallocating client assets into Bitcoin exposure. Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has become a dominant player in the Bitcoin ETF space. The fund has consistently outpaced other ETFs in inflows and asset growth, including traditional vehicles such as gold ETFs. Its rise has been fueled by growing demand from institutions and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin. According to data from Sosovalue, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT held $66.9 billion in net assets as of May 19, making it the largest Bitcoin ETF by value. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The Significance of Jamie Dimon‚Äôs Reluctant Bitcoin Surrender

Time Published: 2025-05-20T18:55:24Z

Correspondent JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon at the Global Markets Conference in Paris on May 15, 2025. Correspondent JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs CEO Jamie Dimon has long been one of Bitcoin‚Äôs most vicious skeptics. In 2017, he said he would fire any employee who traded Bitcoin for being ‚Äústupid,‚Äù and called it a ‚Äúfraud.‚Äù Last year, he called the cryptocurrency a ‚Äúpet rock.‚Äù But this week, Dimon announced that JPMorgan Chase would allow its clients to buy Bitcoin. He said it with a grimace on his face, speaking at JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs investor day, and rattled off a list of criticisms shared by other Bitcoin cynics, including that the currency facilitated sex trafficking and terrorism. But he conceded that his clients could do what they wished with their money. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin. Go at it.‚Äù Advertisement Advertisement The decision marks a significant symbolic and practical victory for the Bitcoin community, which, despite its anti-establishment beginnings, has sought institutional acceptance. Dimon, a heavyweight of traditional finance, has consistently used his perch to discourage regular investors and other financial leaders from getting involved. But he has also often been called a pragmatist‚Äîand his shift on Bitcoin reflects a changed political climate and mounting client demand. Read More: Why Trump‚Äôs Meme Coins Have Alarmed Both Crypto Insiders and Legal Experts Dimon‚Äôs decision arises from a year of mounting competition and interest in Bitcoin from other large firms. The entwining of Bitcoin and traditional finance kicked off in January 2024, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reluctantly gave the green light for Bitcoin ETFs‚Äîinvestment vehicles which allow people to bet on Bitcoin‚Äôs price without actually holding it‚Äîto enter the market. Billions of dollars immediately flowed into these ETFs, proving their value to major financial institutions like BlackRock. That summer, Morgan Stanley allowed its wealth advisors to sell Bitcoin ETFs to clients, and Goldman Sachs purchased $418 million worth of them. Then, Donald Trump won the presidency, sending crypto hype into overdrive. On the campaign trail, Trump won over many crypto fans for accusing Biden of choking off the industry. Trump then pledged to make the U.S. the ‚ÄúBitcoin capital of the world.‚Äù Since his election, Trump has thrown both his government influence and personal brand behind cryptocurrency efforts. And the banking sector has been significantly impacted. In his first week in office, Trump repealed SAB 121, a Biden-era accounting rule which discouraged banks from handling crypto assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency then rescinded their anti-crypto guidance, leaving much greater discretion to the banks on how to deal with digital assets. Many banks jumped in. Goldman Sachs amassed a stockpile of over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. The CEOs of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley both expressed interest in offering crypto products. Dimon could have stuck to his guns and kept JPMorgan out of it. But the bank‚Äîwhich is the biggest in America, with over $3 trillion in assets worldwide‚Äî risked losing high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients seeking to diversify their portfolios at a moment of extreme financial volatility. So now, JPMorgan customers will be allowed to buy Bitcoin, he said on Monday. He added, however, that the bank would not custody Bitcoin, necessitating a trusted third party. Dimon‚Äôs decision could bring about further change. His capitulation could serve as a powerful signal to other holdouts in traditional finance. And JPMorgan‚Äôs massive customer base could bring in a new wave of Bitcoin investors. Crypto Twitter, unsurprisingly, gleefully celebrated his about-face. ‚ÄúJamie Dimon has bent the knee,‚Äù Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan, wrote on Twitter. ¬© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

Title: 3 Terrible Companies To Lose $5 Billion in Federal Green Energy Loans
URL: https://reason.com/2025/05/20/3-terrible-companies-to-lose-5-billion-in-federal-green-energy-loans/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T17:37:59Z

Energy & Environment Jeff Luse | 5.20.2025 1:37 PM In the last days of the Biden administration, the Energy Department dolled out billions of dollars for politically favored green energy projects. The Trump administration is looking to claw this funding back. The Energy Department is getting ready to "cancel seven major loans and loan guarantees that had been conditionally approved under the Biden administration," reports Semafor. This action will cancel approximately $5 billion worth of funding for a transmission project by a New Jersey utility company, a loan program for low-income homeowners to install rooftop solar panels by Sunnova, and a Monolith Nebraska factory to produce low-carbon ammonia. The remaining four projects, which collectively received over $3 billion, include three battery factories and a plastics and recycling facility, which "were already previously cancelled by their companies because of other various headwinds," according to Semafor. The three active projects that will have their federal loans axed have faced their own share of problems. In September 2023, Sunnova received a $3 billion partial loan guarantee from the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office (LPO) for Project Hestia‚Äîa program that would make residential rooftop solar, battery storage, and virtual power plants "available to more American homeowners." Hestia was expected to provide loans to as many as 115,000 homeowners in the United States and Puerto Rico for these technologies, while creating "3,400 good-paying, high-quality American jobs." After receiving the federal loan, Sunnova came under fire for its alleged history of predatory practices and scamming elderly clients, which led to subsequent congressional scrutiny. In April, Sunnova began filing for bankruptcy. The company recently said it was no longer planning to use the programming funding and was working with the Energy Department to return the remaining guarantees. Monolith received a $953 million conditional loan guarantee from the LPO to accelerate its clean hydrogen and carbon utilization project in Nebraska. The company, which has received backing from BlackRock and NextEra Energy and was valued at over $1 billion in 2022, creates hydrogen fuel with renewable energy (which can be used to make ammonia in fertilizers) and carbon black. Despite the federal funding and private sector support, The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2024 that the company was "running short on cash and facing project delays." The third project facing the ax is New Jersey's Clean Energy Corridor, "a project to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate planned generation in New Jersey to meet growing electricity demand." Run by Jersey Central Power & Light Company, the project received a conditional loan guarantee of up to $716 million in January to support the state's goal of "introducing 11,000 MW of offshore wind-generated electricity by 2035." When First Energy, which owns Jersey Central, first announced the project in 2022, Danish energy company Orsted was planning two large wind projects off New Jersey's coast. The projects were canceled in 2023. Another New Jersey offshore wind project was recently halted after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the project's environmental permits. Despite these project cancellations and the LPO's history of questionable and risky investments, it does not appear that the office is going away soon; Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently told lawmakers that his agency would use the LPO to advance nuclear energy projects. Assuming Wright fully cuts billions of dollars worth of wasteful projects and narrows the agency's scope to only fund nuclear power projects, it's possible that the LPO's budget‚Äîwhich ballooned to over $400 billion under the Biden administration‚Äîcould meaningfully shrink. Still, a meaningfully reduced budget is not enough. With the national deficit climbing to over $28 trillion in debt held by the public, taxpayers can no longer afford to support the federal government's fantasy that it should be a green bank.

Title: Noom is offering microdoses of compounded Wegovy for weight loss
URL: https://qz.com/noom-weight-loss-drugs-glp-1-wegovy-alternative-1851781546
Time Published: 2025-05-20T17:13:45Z
Full Content:
Noom will start offering smaller doses of compounded Wegovy (NVO+1.61%), the blockbuster weight-loss drug, as the digital health company continues to adapt to the growing demand for affordable weight-loss solutions and a changing market. Reuters (TRI+0.10%) reported that Noom is rolling out personalized doses of its semaglutide drug to help patients manage their weight while minimizing side effects (such as nausea) that are a common concern with full doses of the drug. Smaller doses can also help patients cut down on costs. Wegovy can cost upward of $349 for a 2.5-milligram vial. Meanwhile, Noom‚Äôs compounded semaglutide, offered through a telehealth model, allows patients to access the treatment at a fraction of the cost, starting at $149 for the first month. Taking smaller doses of the medication has become popular due to the drugs‚Äô expense and side effects, but Noom told Reuters that its goal isn‚Äôt to capitalize on the microdosing trend but rather to provide a more manageable and effective weight-loss solution, tailored to individual patient needs. In a recent blog post, CEO Geoff Cook wrote that Noom‚Äôs GLP-1 RX Program with Smart Dose can address gaps ‚Äúto provide a personalized, behaviorally integrated approach for patients who need it.‚Äù Members who are prescribed a program with Noom‚Äôs SmartDose may start at a lower than commercially available dose and move their dosage up at a personalized pace based on individual response. Users will continue to adjust their dose through frequent check-ins to ensure the treatment is working best for them. According to Reuters, Noom‚Äôs personalized approach could start with half of the standard 0.25-milligram starter dose of Wegovy and gradually increase to around half of the FDA-approved maximum dose of 2.4 milligrams over a 20-week period. Noom has been offering the SmartDose program to patients clinically indicated since February. The move comes as demand for weight-loss medications such as Wegovy has surged, driven by their ability to help patients potentially lose up to 20% of their body weight. The FDA is moving to rein in unapproved compounded versions of semaglutide-based drugs such as Wegovy. These versions were temporarily permitted during shortages, but that exemption ends May 22. Noom, however, is betting its personalized prescribing model will still comply with FDA rules, which allow compounding for individual patients under specific conditions. ‚ÄúThere is a personalized ‚Äî and there has always been a personalized ‚Äî exception,‚Äù Cook, the company‚Äôs CEO, told Reuters. Noom‚Äôs bet on smaller doses of its weight-loss drug comes as recent figures suggest the drug market may be seeing signs of slowing growth. Sales of Wegovy reached approximately 17.36 billion Danish kroner (about $2.64 billion) in Q1 2025, reflecting a 19% year-over-year increase ‚Äî but also a 13% quarter-over-quarter decline, indicating potential signs of market stagnation. And the CEO of Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk just stepped down after the company‚Äôs stock dropped 50% in a year. Competition has intensified, with Eli Lilly‚Äôs (LLY+0.74%) Zepbound and its coming GLP-1 pill adding pressure to the market for weight-loss drugs. Alongside these contenders, compounded alternatives to semaglutide are flooding the market, further complicating the landscape.

Title: Don't call it a comeback: Why Goldman sees the downtrodden Magnificent 7 roaring back to beat the market

The stock market's tech titans stumbled in the first quarter, but 2025 will still be another winning year for the Magnificent Seven, Goldman Sachs said. In a recent note, chief equity strategist David Kostin projected that the mega-cap tech cohort will once again outperform the rest of the S&P 500 in 2025, extending a streak of stellar gains to a third straight year. "We continue to expect that superior earnings growth will drive the Magnificent 7 to outperform the S&P 493 in 2025, but by a smaller magnitude than in recent years," Kostin wrote. "The share price outperformance of the Magnificent 7 has been tied to their earnings growth outperformance." It's a take that might seem contradictory to what's transpired so far this year, as trade policy, AI disruptions, and antitrust moves have muddled the outlook for Big Tech. The group, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple, is down 5% year-to-date, trailing the 4% gain achieved by the broader index. Some big banks, such as Morgan Stanley, have called on investors to reduce tech exposure. Ye, despite the slump so far, Kostin noted that mega-cap tech demonstrated earnings outperformance in the first quarter. In 2025, earnings-per-share growth has surged 28% for the Mag Seven, handily outpacing 9% for the S&P 493. "This magnitude of surprise was the largest since the 2Q 2021 reporting season when the Magnificent 7 beat earnings estimates by 27%," the bank wrote. "Partly as a result of strong 1Q results, consensus 2025 earnings estimates for the Magnificent 7 are roughly in line with where they began the year." What's more, the top tech stocks are now trading at a discounted valuation, resulting from narrowing earnings growth compared to previous years. "The relative valuation is the lowest it's been in the last two years," Kostin told Bloomberg TV. "From a starting point of entry, it's actually looking somewhat more attractive at these levels."

Title: Ulta Stock Catches Oppenheimer's Eye Ahead of Earnings Release Next Week

Ulta (ULTA) shares are in the midst of a glow-up. The cosmetic company is attracting attention from investors, with analysts saying consumers are less likely to cut back on beauty purchases during tough economic times. Oppenheimer is one of the latest investment advisory groups to make this case ahead of Ulta‚Äôs earnings release slated for next week. Oppenheimer maintained its ‚Äúoutperform‚Äù rating of Ulta Tuesday and raised its target price to $465, which is 11% above the average target price among analysts who follow Ulta and were polled by Visible Alpha. Oppenheimer said Ulta appears poised to meet its financial targets and may benefit from limited exposure to tariffs and potential closures of Kohl‚Äôs (KSS) stores, which stock products from Sephora, a cosmetics company owned by LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy. ‚ÄúWe are encouraged by the strategic direction of the company under new CEO Kecia Steelman and are focused on management's execution of key digital priorities in the coming quarters to sustain the company's competitive position vs. [Amazon] AMZN, [Walmart] WMT, and others,‚Äù Oppenheimer said. The cosmetic company‚Äôs stock has shot up about 36% since mid-March when better-than-expected earnings and fresh leadership helped reverse a months-long decline. This puts shares at $420.50‚Äîor more than 8% above where they were a year ago. Wall Street is looking for a roughly 0.2% year-over-year increase in comparable store sales when Ulta shares its first-quarter results on May 29. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect profit of $267.3 million on net sales of $2.79 billion. A year ago, Ulta reported net income of $313.1 million on sales of $2.73 billion.

More AI Can we still call ourselves contrarians if we buy into ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù trends like the stunning growth of AI? Of course we can. Today we‚Äôre going to do just that. But of course we‚Äôre not picking up obvious names like NVIDIA (NVDA). Instead we‚Äôre looking to an 8%-paying fund I see having even more upside than the ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù AI stocks everyone else is buying. The technique we‚Äôre going to use here is a very underappreciated concept called ‚Äúoblique investing.‚Äù Sounds a bit dry, I know, but it‚Äôs anything but. The idea here is, roughly speaking, to invest in big forces driving the market and shifting the economy over the foreseeable future. Obvious, right? There‚Äôs more here, though, because, of course, doing this directly by investing in the trend itself means you‚Äôll likely overpay, since the market has already picked up on it. So instead, we‚Äôre going to look to stocks (and funds!) that are well-positioned to ride the trend higher but aren‚Äôt the obvious names in their sectors. It‚Äôs best to look at this through an example: In the mid-2010s, technology‚Äôs rise to dominance over other sectors was a clear trend. So anyone who bought the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù semiconductor stocks‚ÄîNVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC)‚Äîwould have easily beaten the S&P 500 on average. NVDA Total Returns As we can see, big gains from AMD (in blue) and NVIDIA (in purple) more than offset losses on Intel (in green). However, back then, buying NVIDIA, which was best known for making graphics cards for gamers, seemed like a losing move compared to Intel, which made the CPUs in almost every computer. Even Apple (AAPL) had switched to Intel processors. In other words, the ‚Äúobvious‚Äù investment in the future did not play out, while the closely related, but not directly plausible‚Äîor ‚Äúoblique,‚Äù if you will‚Äîstory did play out. Fast-forward to today and we‚Äôre looking at another trend in the process of rewriting tech‚Äîand many aspects of society as a whole: AI. Here too, NVIDIA is the major player, with its chips powering the AI trend, much like Intel‚Äôs chips powered the rise of tech more generally in the 2010s. Thanks first to its gains from powering the tech sector and then to its AI dominance, NVIDIA has grown to become the second-largest stock in the S&P 500. The numbers are staggering: Over the last 10 years, NVIDIA went from being 0.063% of the S&P 500 to 5.8% now. And as I write this, following the tariff selloff, investors are starting to turn back to the story of US economic growth driven by, you guessed it, technology such as AI. And so NVIDIA is starting to recover, but its ceiling is much lower than it was in the past. It‚Äôs already risen some 25,000%+ in the last 10 years, and another 25,000%+ gain over the next decade is simply not in the cards. Where does that leave us? Obviously, we want to invest in AI‚Äôs ongoing growth, but we don‚Äôt want to get into a crowded trade. That brings me to a closed-end fund (CEF) called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO), which we once held in my CEF Insider service. CEFs are, of course, wildly underappreciated, so to say AIO is ‚Äúoblique‚Äù compared to NVIDIA might be the king of understatements! Nonetheless, this 8%-yielding fund (more on the payout in a moment) does hold NVIDIA, so we get some exposure to the company‚Äôs ongoing growth (which will continue, even if it doesn‚Äôt hit those 25,000% gains of the past). We‚Äôre getting the other ‚Äúusual suspects‚Äù in AI, too, including Meta Platforms (META). But the real key to AIO‚Äôs ‚Äúoblique‚Äù appeal is that it also holds firms that benefit by using AI in their day-to-day businesses, like drug maker Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY), insurer Progressive Corp. (PGR) and heavy-equipment maker Deere & Co. (DE). Firms like these are key to profitable AI investing because it‚Äôs likely to be the users of this tech‚Äînot the providers‚Äîthat reap the biggest profits from it. While it‚Äôs best known for its chatbot, AI leader OpenAI also has many enterprise clients, including John Deere. In short, Deere uses AI to make its products more efficient, such as its herbicide spray, which uses fewer chemicals than competitors‚Äô offerings. That results in healthier, cheaper products, said Justin Rose, Deere‚Äôs president of lifecycle solutions, supply management and customer success, in his recent conversation with OpenAI. (If you‚Äôre into farming, the entire interview is worth reading.) Of course, these are far from obvious cases of AI integration, so they‚Äôre not priced into stocks like Deere yet, and that is exactly why AIO is holding them. Same goes for Progressive using AI to lower its marketing costs and Eli Lilly using AI to discover new drugs. AIO is collecting these ‚Äúhidden‚Äù AI plays for investors to hold for the long haul. Finally, there‚Äôs that 8% dividend, which has held steady since AIO‚Äôs launch. Investors have picked up a couple of nice special dividends, too. AIO Dividend This, by the way, is yet another benefit of ‚Äúoblique‚Äù CEFs: high (and often monthly paid) dividends you have zero hope of getting from a mainstream tech name like NVIDIA.

Title: The Travel Stocks Congress Loves to Trade

Photo Credit: Dozen of lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in travel companies. Wikimedia Commons / David Maiolo More than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in travel companies ‚Äî even as they oversee and regulate them. Members of Congress help shape the future of the travel industry ‚Äî and some are personally investing in it, too. A Skift analysis of congressional financial disclosures reveals that more than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in airlines, hotel chains, cruise companies, and travel tech firms. In all, federal lawmakers and their spouses have made nearly 600 individual travel industry-related stock trades since the 2021-2022 congressional session, congressional financial records indicate. Taken together, the purchases and sales are worth well into the millions of dollars. Shares of Marriott International, Airbnb, Uber, Hilton Worldwide, and Booking Holdings rank among the most frequently traded common stocks by members of Congress and their spouses. Members of Congress are legally allowed to buy and sell individual stocks as long as they don‚Äôt violate the anti-insider trading provisions of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, known as the STOCK Act. They must disclose their trades within 45 days. Dozens of members of Congress have violated these disclosure rules in the past decade. And a growing number of elected Republicans and Democrats alike want to limit or ban trading individual stocks. Even some of Congress‚Äô most prolific travel stock traders tell Skift that they‚Äôre rethinking their investment strategies or have recently stopped trading individual stocks. ‚ÄúThe travel and tourism industry is affected by tax implications, subsidies, lots of decisions,‚Äù said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, director of government affairs for the nonprofit and nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. ‚ÄúLawmakers can pass a stock ban ‚Ä¶ they could just invest in broad-based mutual funds right now.‚Äù Here is Skift‚Äôs company-by-company assessment of which federal lawmakers are trading travel and tourism industry stocks: In all, eight members of Congress disclosed making recent Booking Holdings stock trades within their immediate families, including Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Reps. Jefferson Shreve (R-Ind.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Dan Newhouse (D-Wash.), Bill Keating (D-Mass.), Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas). A Skift analysis reveals that more than three dozen U.S. lawmakers and their spouses have made nearly 600 stock trades in travel industry companies since 2021, including airlines, hotels, cruise lines, and travel tech firms. The most frequently traded stocks include Booking Holdings, Marriott, Airbnb, Hilton, Uber, and Boeing. While members are legally permitted to trade stocks if they follow disclosure rules under the STOCK Act, many have violated these requirements, fueling bipartisan efforts to ban or further restrict individual stock trading by members of Congress. Lawmakers often cite the use of third-party managers or blind trusts to avoid conflicts of interest, but the practice continues to raise ethical concerns.

A total of 358,737 applications were received this year‚Äîdown from over 480,000 last year‚Äîmaking it the lowest since FY22, which saw 308,613 applications. The H-1B visa, long touted as a critical gateway for Indian IT professionals and tech talent globally, is witnessing a decline in demand. Industry analysts attribute the decline to a combination of factors, including: stricter US immigration policies which include the newly introduced ‚ÄúCatch-and-Revoke‚Äù policy, which mandates immediate visa cancellation for any foreign national (including those on H-1B, student visas, or other categories) found to have violated any US law even once; a significant hike in visa registration fees; the Trump administration‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù and MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda; and widespread workforce downsizing by global tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. During Trump‚Äôs previous tenure, denial rates for H-1B petitions rose sharply due to stricter eligibility criteria, increased site visits, and additional documentation requirements, said Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital. Even post his presidency tenure, the lingering effects of these policies, along with the anticipation of a possible return to similar measures, have contributed to ongoing uncertainty. This has made companies wary of investing time and resources in H-1B applications that may face higher chances of rejection or delays, she explained. Further compounding the issue are regulatory and procedural changes to the H-1B registration process. In January, USCIS increased the H-1B visa registration fee from $10 to $215, a move that would impact startups and small firms, which are now more cautious in nominating candidates, shared Mamta Shekhawat, Founder of Gradding.com, a study abroad platform. Moreover, the shift to beneficiary-driven selection- where each candidate is counted only once regardless of the number of employers petitioning, has effectively curbed duplicate applications and attempts to game the lottery system, she added. The broader slowdown in the IT sector is another major factor. Many tech giants implemented significant staff reductions through FY24 and FY25, impacting hiring pipelines. ‚ÄúAs companies tighten budgets, many are prioritising local hiring and internal mobility over international recruitment,‚Äù said Sharma. ‚ÄúEmployers are being more cautious in their hiring practices, especially when it comes to foreign workers.‚Äù Additionally, the rising costs and regulatory complexity of sponsoring H-1B visas have prompted companies to be more selective. As a result, applications are increasingly being filed only for highly specialised roles or project-based needs. Further, the shift to remote work has lessened the immediate need for on-site international talent, says Varun Singh, MD, XIPHIAS Immigration. While the current trend shows a decline, the demand for skilled foreign workers remains high. For FY2026, USCIS received over 343,000 eligible H-1B registrations against a cap of 85,000, indicating sustained interest, shared Singh. However, Sharma noted that the impact of restrictive policies is not limited to H-1B visas. Similar trends are being observed across other work visa categories. ‚ÄúThe L-1 and O-1 programs continue to see slower demand due to compliance challenges and cost considerations. Student visas (F-1) remain stable, but changes to related programs like OPT and H-4 EAD are being closely monitored,‚Äù she said. Overall, companies are cautious across all work visa categories, with hiring largely focused on immediate needs rather than long-term projections. Looking ahead, the outlook for H-1B visa applications remains uncertain. Sharma cautioned that the downward trend could continue if restrictive policies remain in place. ‚ÄúIf the economic climate improves and there‚Äôs a shift toward more open immigration policies, we could see a rebound in H-1B applications,‚Äù she said.

Title: Why Have Start-Ups With $1B Valuation Still Failed To Disrupt The Automotive Industry?

ByJennifer Jacobs Dungs ByJennifer Jacobs Dungs, Contributor. The modern black sports car ,3d ,render. Yet arguably, it is being disrupted but not from these players. But we will get to that later. The automotive industry is complex, capital-intensive, and highly competitive. It has been a long road to get where we are today. Ford was one of the first automakers in the USA to be formed in 1903, when 12 investors raised $28,000. In Europe, Daimler was formed around the same time in 1890 and sold the first contemporary automobiles, the Mercedes, in 1901. Since then, the Big Three, General Motors, Stellantis (formerly Chrysler), and Ford Motor Company have long dominated as the American car companies. In Germany, the Big Three have been Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. A lot can be said about the positive progress and impact these companies have had on the GDP, job creation, and innovation. But when comparing this to the progress in market capitalization, there is a disconnect. The new kids on the block Shanghai,China-April 3rd 2024: Chinese customers at Xiaomi ev store test SU7 electric car Today the market cap for the USA ‚ÄòBig Three‚Äô companies summed together is roughly $112 billion and for the German ‚ÄòBig Three‚Äô it is $140 billion. This pales in comparison to the not-so-new newcomer (founded in 2003), Tesla, which has a market cap larger than all of those 6 companies combined, at ~$800 billion (even with the recent turmoil). And has survived the valley of death around ‚Äòscaling‚Äô and impressively sold ~1.8 million vehicles in 2023 (of the 17M global EVs sold). BYD was founded in 1995 and designed and sold their first car in 2005. This, similar to Tesla, is nearly 100 years after the first car companies in Michigan and Germany were formed! Yet, BYD has a market cap of ~$107B, equivalent to more than 2 of the 3 ‚ÄòBig Three‚Äô in the USA or Germany. Xiaomi was founded even later, in 2010, focused on smartphone devices, and only in 2021 was Xiaomi automobile founded. They recently just reached their 100,000th unit of their first production vehicle, the SU7. This pales in comparison to the production numbers at Volkswagen, where ~9M vehicles were produced in 2024. Yet Xiaomi has a market cap of nearly 3x that of Volkswagen. Surviving the valley of death How have these new kids on the block survived and apparently thrived, when so many others have not. Starting from the beginning, starting a new automotive OEM is monumental and requires billions ‚Äì up to $1 billion alone for the vehicle R&D. Production of a new vehicle can cost between $1 billion and $5 billion (e.g., one capable of producing 20,000+ cars annually), tooling can add another $1 billion. This is all before the supply chain, sales and marketing, and working capital. To put it in perspective, new full-scale OEMs would need to raise $10-$20 billion to just join a ticket to the party. And surprisingly ‚Äì or maybe not so, Tesla did exactly that. It did not hurt that Elon Musk was able to personally invest, he contributed $70 million since 2004 and this helped keep the company afloat during critical times such as the 2008 financial crisis. Turns out this was a good investment, as in November 2024, the shares of Tesla soared again reaching $1 trillion (valued more than Toyota, Ferrari, Porsche, GM, and Ford combined) and continued to increase until January, 2025 ‚Äì but due to several months of turmoil it has fallen ~32%. And there is uncertainty about the future. Unicorn failure GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - FEBRUARY 26: A Lucid Air Pure fully electric EV car is displayed during the ... More Geneva Motor Show 2024 at Palexpo on February 26, 2024 in Geneva, Switzerland. The 2024 Geneva Motor Show opens today for the first time in five years. The event last took place in 2019 with the coronavirus pandemic forcing organisers to cancel the 2020 show just days before the show was due to open. This year‚Äôs Show will be a smaller affair with just four major manufacturers confirmed to attend. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) There have been other companies successful in fundraising ~$1 billion, but their success has not followed the same path. Arrival, the British electric vehicle startup, raised over $1.3 billion during its development and was valued at $13 billion before going into bankruptcy. And this all happened before delivering a single electric van. Rivian raised a $1.3 billion round led by T. Rowe Price in 2019 and a $2.5 billion round in 2020, with major backers such as Amazon, Ford, and BlackRock. In total, Rivian raised over $10 billion prior to its IPO in 2021. It has a market cap of ~$13 billion. Recently, it created a joint venture with Volkswagen Group combined with a total investment of $5.8 billion. But in 2024, Rivian sold only ~51,600 vehicles. Lucid raised over $1 billion from Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Public Investment Fund (PIF) in 2018, and more recently another $1.75 billion to secure runway for 2025. It has a market cap of ~$7 billion. Yet again in 2024, it sold only ~10,241 vehicles. Adding contrast again, GM sold ~6 million vehicles in 2024 worldwide and in their peak sold 10 million in 2016. It is safe to say that these newcomer OEMs are still in the scaling phase. And there are several other newcomer OEMs who have recently had a stop in the road, filing bankruptcy or are shortly before doing so. This includes companies like Faraday Future, which raised $2 billion since its founding in 2014. It has not formally declared bankruptcy but has consistently struggled with funding shortages and scaling production. Fisker Inc. raised significant funds, including through a SPAC merger in 2020 that brought in approximately $1 billion, but was not able to scale. There are other players such as Canoo, Lordstown Motors and Electric Last Mile Solutions, all raising significant cash ‚Äì but somehow not enough to survive ‚Äúthe death valley curve‚Äù. According to Joan Magretta, award-winning contributor to the Harvard Business Review and author, it could be as simple as ensuring the growth ambitions align with the right business model. This makes a lot of sense as the growth ambitions help secure the initial VC funding with a compelling vision and narrative, which led to many companies reaching unicorn status with valuations exceeding $1 billion. But often the start-up underestimates the costs associated with the challenges of scaling an OEM and eventually just runs out of cash. This is the nut that needs to be cracked. Being the fast fish is key to success LEIPZIG, GERMANY - MAY 6: Workers assemble the new all electric Porsche Macan at the Porsche ... More assembly plant on May 6, 2024 in Leipzig, Germany. The electric Macan is Porsche's second electric car after the Taycan. The company also offers two hybrid cars. (Photo by Jens Schlueter/Getty Images) But there is immense value in helping to ensure that new players do not just come on to the field, but stay to play, and disrupt ‚Äì as they can help push the boundaries of innovation as shown in the software race and how Chinese newcomers are revolutionizing the customer experience. They can accelerate sustainability as shown with Tesla, which doubled down on an all-electric fleet from day 1. And can increase competition and consumer choice. Mobility is the backbone of economic growth, social connectivity, and sustainable development. It ties together commerce, urbanization, and technology. And this is true both in Europe and the USA with it representing about 14 million jobs and ~7% of the GDP and 10 million jobs and ~3% of GDP, respectively. In order to stay competitive, the Western incumbents have started considering to join forces with the newcomers (as shown with VW Group and Rivian). But this alone will likely not be enough. For newcomers to establish themselves and achieve commercial viability, they need a supportive ecosystem that fosters growth. Access to venture capital funding, state grants, loans, and tax incentives can provide the necessary financial boost. Beyond financial backing, technical expertise is critical. New OEMs must leverage experienced development and manufacturing partners to properly implement their innovations, scale production efficiently and take off into the right direction. Strategic investments from industrial players and tech giants can offer private growth capital that ensures long-term sustainability. It was nearly 10 years ago but couldn‚Äôt be more true today as stated by Klaus Schwab, WEF, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ it is not the big fish which eats the small fish, it‚Äôs the fast fish which eats the slow fish.‚Äù And in the automotive industry, it is time to do what cars do best - speed up!

Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM), Amundi and BlackRock have been selected to manage assets in the State‚Äôs incoming automatic-enrolment pension scheme. It is expected these companies will complete contract negotiations this summer, well in advance of the commencement of the auto-enrolment regime, known as My Future Fund, in January, the Department of Social Protection said in a statement on Tuesday. ILIM had ‚Ç¨131 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the end of last year. Amundi is Europe‚Äôs largest asset manager, with ‚Ç¨2.24 trillion of AUM in December, while BlackRock is the world‚Äôs largest, with $11.6 trillion. Amundi has a significant presence in Ireland, with about 380 employees, stemming from its 2017 purchase of Dublin-based Pioneer Investments in 2017. BlackRock opened an office in Dublin, home to one of the world‚Äôs largest funds hubs, in 2011, and has subsequently grown its headcount to more than 140 employees. [ Looming launch of auto-enrolment pensions means no honeymoon for incoming ministerOpens in new window ] ‚ÄúMy Future Fund is a transformative initiative that will revolutionise how people save for their retirement,‚Äù said Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary. ‚ÄúThis is a landmark policy and these investment management companies, who have been selected after a competitive procurement process, will play a huge role in ensuring that My Future Fund is a success and represents good value for money for all future participants.‚Äù The Department of Social Protection has in recent weeks launched a search for a chief executive of the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority (Naersa), which will oversee the administration of the AE scheme. AE will capture about 800,000 workers in the State that are not currently part of a pension plan. The appointee to the ‚Ç¨215,000-a-year role will be expected to ‚Äúbring vision, strategic leadership and effective management across all the functions of the Naersa in order to ensure that it discharges its functions efficiently and effectively to the benefit of its estimated 800,000 participants and Irish society more generally,‚Äù according to an information booklet for candidates. May 29th has been set as the closing date for applications. The AE scheme is expected it will hold more than ‚Ç¨20 billion of assets on behalf of beneficiaries within 10 years, rising potentially to more than ‚Ç¨300 billion over 30-40 years, according to the booklet. First proposed by then government Fianna F√°il minister S√©amus Brennan in 2006, AE has been through years of delays and false dawns. However, enabling legislation was finally enacted last July and Indian group Tata Consultancy Services was signed up in October to build and run the AE system. The department is in the middle of procuring three investment managers to handle the assets in the fund. Under the terms of the Irish scheme, which applies to workers aged between 23 and 60 who earn at least ‚Ç¨20,000 per annum across one or more jobs, employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross earnings to their pension pot, with the government adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions are due to increase in stages over 10 years, reaching 6 per cent, 6 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.

Title: Blog: Whatever Happened To 'Working From Home'? Why Your Boss Wants You Back In Office

Time Published: 2025-05-20T13:30:18Z

On Thursday, I had to hop on a video call for a friend's YouTube channel back in India. Without fuss, I set up shop in the echo-chic cafe at my local IKEA. Unlimited coffee, free WiFi and a great background. What more could one ask for? Turns out I am not alone in this lifestyle choice. According to a 2023 survey by office design firm Octra, as many as 62% of UK professionals say they prefer working from places like cafes, libraries and even lush public parks. That's right, more than half of us have ditched cubicles for cappuccinos. As for me, I write a regular column for NDTV and have no office to speak of. I work out of a cosy little cafe tucked inside my apartment complex. The cafe owner is Kurdish, though she looks English, and her waiters are all English, too. If you turned this place into an office, it could easily pass for a UN outpost, as her customers come from every corner of the world. My productivity thrives on the aroma of Arrabiata and crushed cappuccinos. But I envy the next-door neighbours in a gleaming 40-storey tower. They have got a swanky coworking floor complete with WiFi, free-flowing coffee and designer sofas to boot. This is the world I belong to now, and after nearly 30 years boxed into office walls, it feels liberating. It's the same world millions of others turn to when they want to get their office work done, spark a little creativity or just log in to yet another video call. The return-to-office (RTO) vs. work-from-home (WFH) debate is currently tearing through the corporate world - including in India. What was once seen as a pandemic-era workaround - hybrid and remote work - has now become a lifestyle cornerstone for millions of workers around the world. People have grown so comfortable working from home that they have normalised dressing professionally only for the camera - formal on top, pyjama or shorts below. But just when we thought this was the new normal, the suits are staging a comeback. Big names like Amazon, Uber, SAP, JPMorgan Chase and Nike have sounded the bugle. Employees are being called back to the office - sometimes for as many as five full days a week. According to a 2023 survey by KPMG, a whopping 83% of CEOs globally say they expect a full return to in-office work within the next three years. The corporate justification rests on the usual mantras: collaboration, innovation and culture. In India, where the tech sector gamely followed Silicon Valley into work-from-home (WFH), there is growing pressure to follow it right back into the office - just like its Silicon Valley big brother. But the socio-economic implications are wildly different. Remote work helped Indians escape overpriced urban rentals, opened doors for women and gave countless workers a shot at a better work-life balance. Undoing all that could feel like taking away the ladder just as people were halfway up. And what about the gig economy? It thrives on flexibility, but some experts believe it now stands to take a hit if rigid office culture returns. Are we really going to ask a freelance coder in Coimbatore to relocate just to be supervised by someone who still doesn't fully grasp how GitHub works? Having said that, I must add that some Indian firms are navigating the middle path with surprising agility. From tier-2 cities offering coworking hubs to IT majors experimenting with three-day office weeks, there's an effort to make hybrid work culturally and structurally viable. The key, as always, will be to avoid copying Silicon Valley blindly - and instead adapt global trends to local realities. Globally, there appears to be an employee pushback. An SAP manager in Vancouver told this writer that he believes he brings in more moolah for the company working remotely than he would from a cubicle. At his workplace, a hybrid setup has been in place for over a year. "It's there, but it's not enforced with an iron fist - at least not yet. That said, there's a quiet worry in the background: will this suddenly flip into a rigid policy or worse, be used as a pretext for layoffs?" Sure, he admits some roles genuinely benefit from in-person teamwork - think fast-paced brainstorming, creative sessions or problem-solving marathons. But the vast majority of jobs, he says, can be done just as well -- if not better -- from a remote setup. "Personally, I was relieved that the old, rigid office routine was behind me. It offered a more flexible, common-sense approach -- come in when needed, stay home when it makes more sense. It's a win-win that respects both business needs and personal sanity." To be honest, working remotely wasn't exactly a revolutionary idea even before Covid-19 came along. Virtual collaboration was already baked into the system at many companies with footprints in multiple countries. Ask a veteran techie in Bengaluru, and he would tell you that his company's operation ran 24/7 with its teams scattered across time zones. So, working remotely was a necessity, not a luxury. Today, it's a global culture. The tech world was the forerunner, and now, it has engulfed all sectors. Let's look at some facts: 52% of hybrid workers say they're more productive. Another 64% claim it's a better use of their time. And 85% say they're happier doing it. So if you're hitting your targets while also walking your dog, maybe we don't need to panic? Bosses are worried about ‚Äúfauxductivity‚Äù - that quaint buzzword for pretending to work while doing laundry, picking up groceries, etc. And sure, some people are doing household chores and simultaneously dialling into office calls. Research does back some of these concerns: a 2022 study by Microsoft found that 49% of remote workers admitted to doing non-work activities during work hours, like running errands or doing household chores. RTO supporters argue that bringing everyone back to the office ensures fairness, especially for on-site workers in roles that simply can't be done remotely. They also claim it strengthens workplace culture and improves transparency. Fair points. But critics push back, saying that culture isn't brewed in the office kitchen. It's built on trust, purpose and leaders who don't micromanage employees like headmasters. And nothing erodes that trust faster than treating adults like teenagers skipping class. On the flip side, hybrid workers consistently report lower stress levels, with 85% saying flexible arrangements have boosted their job satisfaction. Burnout drops, motivation rises, and people still deliver results - all without the need to badge-swipe or sit in traffic. Still, those advocating for a full return insist that in-person work fosters accountability, clearer communication and a shared sense of purpose. So the question is, if people are meeting or even exceeding their targets, why obsess over where they sit while doing it? RTO mandates aren't just morale-busters for many. They come with a hefty price tag. A UK-wide study from Gensler, the global architecture and design firm, estimates that maintaining office space can cost companies upwards of ¬£7,700 (Rs 8.7 lakh) per employee annually. Add to that the human cost: according to a report by Owl Labs, nearly 40% of remote professionals say they would consider quitting if forced to return to the office full time. And it's not an empty threat. A University of Chicago study found that companies mandating a full RTO saw a significant loss of senior talent. Many seasoned professionals - the institutional memory of any organisation so to speak - opted to jump ship to more flexible employers. This talent drain not only affects productivity but also leaves junior staff without mentors, further hurting long-term performance. The RTO hardliners also ignore one crucial truth, that presenteeism doesn't equal productivity. Just because someone is warming a chair doesn't mean they are contributing meaningfully. In fact, rigid attendance policies often lead to disengagement. Today's workforce craves autonomy - the ability to decide how and where they work best. Sir Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at Manchester Business School, was quoted in a report saying: "If you micromanage, you won't get productivity gains and you won't attract the next generation." So what's the smarter route? Flexible work structures that prioritise output over optics. Companies that embrace hybrid and remote models tend to save significantly on real estate. That money can be redirected into people-centric initiatives, such as training programmes or wellness initiatives. It could be reinvested in better tech. And hold on, RTO hardliners. Even a halfway decent coffee machine might spark more creativity than those rickety old vending machines that cough up lukewarm sludge in the name of an office. There's a deeper cultural win. When companies trust employees to work on their terms, it builds loyalty. It signals respect. It says: we care more about what you achieve than where you do it from. Of course, flexibility doesn't mean free-for-all. It requires structure, clear expectations and regular communication. It also means designing hybrid systems that allow for meaningful in-person collaboration without turning it into a commute-heavy hamster wheel. Some of the most forward-thinking companies are leading the way here. Airbnb, for instance, allows staff to work from anywhere permanently. Spotify offers a "Work From Anywhere" programme. Remote work isn't a trend; it's a tectonic shift. And while return-to-office policies may work for certain industries or roles, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to stick in the long run. For many of us, the pandemic rewired not just our routines, but our expectations. We discovered new ways to work, live and balance the two. Flexibility is no longer a perk - it's a baseline requirement. In the end, the big irony is that Silicon Valley sold us the dream of working from anywhere - now it wants everyone back at their desks. Well, they have got the dough, they have got the clout, their wishes might just prevail. As for me, I am writing this very column from my favourite cafe, fuelled by Illy coffee and a quiet corner. The work gets done - often more smoothly than it ever did under fluorescent lights and the hum of a tired vending machine. Over to you, dear readers. (Syed Zubair Ahmed is a London-based senior Indian journalist with three decades of experience with the Western media) Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author Tim Cook is more likely bothered about what they think of the way he manages his company's huge cash pile - estimated at well over $300 billion - than an oddball statement from Trump about moving all production to America. The US' federal debt is a staggering $36 trillion and its debt-to-GDP ratio is among the highest in the world; as of 2025 only seven countries owed more money than they earned. The tragedy of Piku is that in the effort to raise a feminist daughter, Bhashkor inadvertently created a woman who cannot separate agency from obligation. She has the freedom to walk away, but no inner permission to exercise it. The problem of Nagaland and the northeastern states stems from an aggressive China that has, over the years, waged a non-conventional war against India directly and indirectly, using Myanmar. While we establish a new normal of military deterrence between India and Pakistan, we seem to have forgotten that our most valuable allies have to be the people themselves. A Qatari official told CNN the plane would be a 'gift to the Pentagon', a 'government-to-government transaction' that will then be 'donated' to Trump's presidential library. On February 20, 2025, Alnur Mussayev, who claimed to be a KGB officer, made the most fantastic of Facebook posts - that in 1987 Russia recruited a then 40-year-old Donald Trump as an 'intelligence asset'. On board the rocket was EOS-9, designed to provide continuous and reliable remote sensing data for operational applications across various sectors. For its sheer optics, Trump's Gulf tour was quite over the top, with his three hydrocarbon-rich hosts going overboard in offering him mega-deals. Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza has entered its most intense phase yet with the expansion of Operation Gideon's Chariot.

Business A Google logo is seen at a company research facility in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 13, 2025. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo MOUNTAIN VIEW, California :Alphabet's Google said on Tuesday it would put artificial intelligence into the hands of more Web surfers while teasing a $249.99-a-month subscription for its AI power users, its latest effort to fend off growing competition from startups like OpenAI. Google unveiled the plans amid a flurry of demos that included new smart glasses during its annual I/O conference in Mountain View, California, which has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI challenged the tech company's longtime stronghold of organizing and retrieving information on the internet. In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. On Tuesday, it further laid out a vision for Google Search that lets consumers ask virtually anything, from simple queries to complex research questions, from analyzing what a smartphone camera sees to fetching an event ticket to buy. Google likewise said it aims to build AI that is personal and proactive, whether phoning a store for users or sending students a practice test generated on the fly.

Google's new plan also includes 30 terabytes of cloud storage and an ad-free YouTube subscription.Google already offers other subscription options, including a $19.99-per-month service with access to some AI capabilities unavailable for most free users and cheaper plans with additional cloud storage.

Title: From Dublin bank official to medal-winning gardener at Chelsea: Billy Alexander on turning his side hustle to gold

Time Published: 2025-05-20T12:04:43Z
Full Content:
Billy Alexander of Co Kerry-based Kells Bay House and Gardens knows what it‚Äôs like to go from boom to bust to bloom. The former assistant bank manager at AIB was awarded a gold medal for his fern collection at the Chelsea Flower Show, for decades of work with ferns. It his not his first Chelsea rodeo. This is his fourth medal at ‚Äúthe pinnacle of horticulture‚Äù, as he puts it. In 2018 he won silver gilt, followed in 2021 by gold for his display of ferns. In 2023, he won gold again, along with Best in Show. ‚ÄúEvery rodeo gets better,‚Äù he says as he‚Äôs interviewed over the phone while selling a ‚Ç¨30 specimen to a customer from his Chelsea stand. He‚Äôs got a cool head on his shoulders. But rewind more than 20 years ago and the Blackrock, Co Dublin native and former banker used to cycle home from his day job as a banking clerk at AIB bank centre to his house in Leopardstown, where he spent his evenings on his knees becoming a ‚Äúcompulsive gardener‚Äù. Tree ferns are his thing. He was first introduced to the plant type by Aunt Cora, a friend of his mother‚Äôs who, before she died in her early 50s, became like ‚Äúa surrogate mother‚Äù to the then 20-something. ‚ÄúShe bought me a tree fern, a Dicksonia antarctica‚Äù. The passion prompted him to start a hobby business selling plants, while not yet giving up on the day job. Alexander encountered Kells Bay for the first time when he drove southwest to deliver some plants to its former owners. The 19th-century hunting lodge overlooks the Iveragh Peninsula and is set on 60 acres of historic subtropical garden. ‚ÄúIt was a nirvana of plants,‚Äù he recalls. The tree fern forest that sealed the deal. Home to an extraordinary collection of naturalised tree ferns, its oldest specimen of Dicksonia antarctica ‚Äì known as the garden‚Äôs ‚Äúmother tree fern‚Äù, is believed to have single-handedly spored the hundreds of others that now flourish in the protected microclimate of Kells Bay‚Äôs primeval forest. Leveraging his three-bed semi in Leopardstown and three apartments he owned, he made an offer of ‚Ç¨2 million on the property, first directly to the owners and then through their agent. About a year later they came back to say that they‚Äôd accept it, but by then he didn‚Äôt have the money. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have ‚Ç¨2 million, but I can give you ‚Ç¨1.5 million, he recalls saying. It was accepted. This was 2006. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt easy, but it was possible ‚Äì but impossible now,‚Äù he says. After the boom came the bust. He had to deal with vulture funds, but ‚Äúlittle by little the dream got better‚Äù, he says. [ Best in show: Irish dahlia growers compete in the UKOpens in new window ] He and his wife Penn now work the property together. She‚Äôs from Thailand and the resident chef, and B&B costs about ‚Ç¨140 to ‚Ç¨150 per person. They‚Äôre travelling to her native country in October and will visit the area that borders China to see scheffleras, tropical evergreen shrubs, in the wild. Also in his travel plans is a research trip to Uganda to see Lobelia that is native to the Mountains of the Moon Massif. Alexander has also visited Highgrove House, family residence of King Charles III and Queen Camilla, several times. He had his daughter Aisling with him on the stand when the king presented him with his medal. Even the logistics of the Chelsea show are an enormous undertaking. His stand, in the Grand Pavilion, is 120sq m in size and features more than 100 different species of ferns. Every plant in it was lovingly transported to the London showgrounds by Hutton Transport last week, in a 40-foot temperature-controlled truck. Alexander set the temperature to eight degrees Celsius, to ‚Äúput the plants to sleep‚Äù for the 48-hour journey. He selected 26 of the 50 specimens he grew to be able to make those choices, having nurtured them for two years in advance of this May event. ‚ÄúYou need to be able to do quality control, so you need twice the amount,‚Äù he explains. He will sell some of his stock, but much of it will make the return journey to west Kerry. And how much does it cost to stage such a show? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sort of like the Olympics,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey give you a small stipend for your expenses.‚Äù The stipend amounts to about ¬£300 (‚Ç¨356). But the actual cost of exhibiting comes close to about ‚Ç¨50,000. Alexander‚Äôs stand has been sponsored by Wilde Aparthotels.

Title: Tesla EV Battery Supplier CATL's Stock Soars After Largest Listing in 2025

Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, soared more than 16% in their Hong Kong trading debut Tuesday after the Chinese electric vehicle battery maker raised more than $4.5 billion in the world's largest listing this year. The listing comes as Chinese companies are grappling with the effects of the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs, despite recent rollbacks. CATL, the world's largest EV battery maker, benefited from investors' faith in the EV boom, and raised 35.51 billion Hong Kong dollars ($4.54 billion) from its secondary listing. (The company is already listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in mainland China.) CATL's listing is the world's largest this year, according to Dealogic data, exceeding the $1.75 billion raised by liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter Venture Global (VG) from its January initial public offering or the $1.57 billion by Nvidia-backed (NVDA) AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV). The second-biggest IPO this year was the $3 billion IPO in March by Japan‚Äôs JX Advanced Metals, according to the data provider. The company, which is a supplier of EV batteries to companies like Tesla (TSLA), had sold 135 million shares at 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.60) each ahead of its secondary listing. Shares closed Tuesday at HK$306.20. In its prospectus, CATL said that at the end of last year, its "EV batteries were installed in over 17 million vehicles, which represents one in every three EVs worldwide." It said the bulk of the IPO proceeds would go toward funding its plant in Hungary. UPDATE‚ÄîMay 20, 2025: This article has been updated to include data from Dealogic to show it's this year's largest listing.

Title: Nvidia's AI Ecosystem Masterplan Is Driving Its Stock

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia Stock. (Photo Illustration by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have increased by nearly 11% in the last week, and is still up almost 40% over the last 30 days. While wider markets have risen after China and the U.S. declared a 90-day halt on tariffs, which is considered a step toward de-escalating the global trade conflict, there have also been a number of company-specific positives for Nvidia as well. Nvidia has introduced NVLink Fusion, a new interconnect technology for chip-to-chip communications that aims to enhance the capabilities of AI systems. Importantly, the company indicates that it will license this technology to other chip designers, allowing them to develop rapid and high-performing custom AI chips. This enables third-party providers to construct semi-custom AI systems that still integrate with Nvidia‚Äôs ecosystem. This strategy broadens Nvidia‚Äôs reach within the custom AI hardware sector beyond its own products. Firms like Marvell and MediaTek intend to integrate Fusion into their custom AI system designs. This could be a strategic long-term initiative for Nvidia, as it may encourage companies to commit to its software suite. It could be a move towards Nvidia establishing de facto standards for AI hardware, similar to how Intel influenced the PC sector with its x86 architecture. During President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared that the company would deliver over 18,000 Blackwell AI chips to an AI startup based in Saudi Arabia called Humain, for application in its AI data centers. The so-called ‚Äúsovereign AI‚Äù sector, which encompasses government-sponsored projects to establish domestic AI capabilities, is gaining significant importance for Nvidia as it seeks to lessen its dependency on American technological giants. Various companies, including Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft, are collectively estimated to make up more than 50% of Nvidia's revenue. Many of these corporations are also working on their own AI chips, making it even more critical for Nvidia to balance its investments. Currently, the rise in NVDA stock over the past four years has been anything but steady, with annual returns being much more erratic than the S&P 500. The stock achieved returns of 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, displays significantly lower volatility. Furthermore, it has consistently surpassed the S&P 500 in the last four years. What accounts for that? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have demonstrated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, providing a smoother ride as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current unpredictable macroeconomic context concerning interest rate reductions and various conflicts, could NVDA find itself facing a similar predicament as in 2022 and underperform the S&P in the coming year, or will it experience a robust upturn? We estimate Nvidia's stock at approximately $101 per share, about 25% lower than the present market value. Explore our evaluation of Nvidia valuation: Is it Overpriced or Underpriced?. Several factors contribute to our current pessimism regarding the stock. We foresee a potential decline in the enthusiasm surrounding AI applications that has driven gains over the past two years, as marginal performance improvements from larger models diminish, alongside challenges in accessing high-quality training data. This transition towards more efficient models could aggravate the effects of a prospective slowdown for GPU manufacturers, including Nvidia. Even though Nvidia stock has been an outstanding performer over recent years, shares can decline rapidly ‚Äì by 20%, 30%, or even 50% ‚Äì as has been observed during previous market crashes. No stock is invulnerable. What is the lowest Nvidia stock could fall to in a market collapse? It's beneficial to stay informed.

Title: Bitcoin Price Nears Record Highs: Are We Headed For A $120,000 Breakout

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. With Bitcoin (BTC) surging back above the $105,000 mark and nearing its record high set in January, market expert Doctor Profit has outlined bullish predictions for the leading cryptocurrency. In a recent post on social media platform X, he detailed the dynamics he believes will drive Bitcoin toward new highs. Since hitting $77,000, Doctor Profit identified $100,000 as the first significant target, which has now been achieved. Looking ahead, he sees the next breakout target between $116,000 and $120,000. His confidence stems from several positive indicators, including a strong bullish divergence observed on the daily chart‚Äîa technical signal often associated with forthcoming price increases. He emphasized that daily divergences tend to have a higher success rate than those seen on longer time frames. Additionally, Doctor Profit pointed out that the funding rate is currently stable, with no over-leveraged positions in the market. He noted that BTC recently broke out of a significant double bottom formation and is now testing previous highs. A critical factor in his outlook is the substantial accumulation by US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are reportedly purchasing Bitcoin at a rate eight times greater than its current mining output. This aggressive accumulation phase, according to Doctor Profit, indicates institutional interest remains robust, even as retail traders have largely stayed on the sidelines during recent volatility. The analyst also highlighted that the strongest retail buying occurred around the $90,000 mark, which also represents a liquidity hotspot. Should the market revisit this level, he sees it as an optimal entry point, perfectly positioned at the bottom of the established trading box. Looking ahead, Doctor Profit anticipates volatility, particularly in light of Moody‚Äôs recent downgrade of the US credit rating from AAA to AA1‚Äîthe first major downgrade since S&P‚Äôs similar action in 2011. Historical context suggests that such downgrades can lead to swift market corrections. In August 2011, following a downgrade, markets dropped by 5.5% in a single day. Doctor Profit believes that Bitcoin could similarly dip into the $90,000 range to capture liquidity before rebounding. Despite potential short-term fluctuations due to the downgrade, Doctor Profit maintains a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, reiterating his target of $116,000 to $120,000. He noted that the market had largely priced in the downgrade, and historically, stocks have rallied following such events. With major institutions, including BlackRock, increasing their Bitcoin purchases in the exchange-traded fund arena, Doctor Profit sees no signs of weakness in the market, pointing to further price gains for the market‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,400, marking a 12% increase over the past two weeks and a nearly 24% increase over the past month. Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency has gained 60%, lagging behind XRP‚Äôs gains of over 300% in the same period.

Title: Companies Are Planning to Build Factories In America. Are Trump's Tariffs Working?

Big manufacturing investments are coming to the U.S. as tariffs threaten supply chains and production. Trump has said restoring U.S. manufacturing is one of his primary goals with tariffs. In recent months, several companies have announced they are building new facilities or expanding production in the U.S. as Trump's trade policies have imposed new barriers to imports. Last month, Swiss drugmaker Roche said it was putting $50 billion into expanding its U.S. footprint, though it did not explicitly cite tariffs as the reason. However, Trump has said he is planning to impose a tariff of 25% on all pharmaceutical imports to encourage companies to locate factories in the U.S. Several other pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Novartis (NVS), also said they were spending billions to expand production in the U.S. Other companies that have announced expansions include: On top of that, multiple companies said they were considering expanding U.S.-based production in light of Trump's tariffs. It's still too early to tell if those announcements add up to a manufacturing renaissance spurred by the tariffs.Many manufacturers were already looking to expand U.S. production in an effort to simplify supply lines and avoid a repeat of the logistical headaches of 2020, when COVID-19 shutdowns wreaked havoc on the production and transportation of various goods.In March and before the bulk of tariffs were announced, U.S. companies spent money on building factories at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $234 billion, nearly triple the $79 billion in February 2020, according to the Census Bureau. Economists doubted that the tariffs would result in a large-scale return of manufacturing jobs to the U.S., though many predicted that they could create at least some jobs.Goldman Sachs, for instance, predicted that the tariffs would lead to the creation of about 100,000 new jobs in manufacturing in the U.S. At the same time, however, they estimated the import taxes would cost 500,000 jobs. Tariffs come with some downsides for U.S. manufacturers, even as they protect some companies from foreign competition: firms that import parts or materials pay higher prices, and companies that export products are hurt by foreign retaliation to U.S. trade barriers, for instance.Some companies have already reportedly announced layoffs related to the tariffs, including Mack Trucks and Volvo.

In recent months, several companies have announced they are building new facilities or expanding production in the U.S. as Trump's trade policies have imposed new barriers to imports. Last month, Swiss drugmaker Roche said it was putting $50 billion into expanding its U.S. footprint, though it did not explicitly cite tariffs as the reason. However, Trump has said he is planning to impose a tariff of 25% on all pharmaceutical imports to encourage companies to locate factories in the U.S. Several other pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Novartis (NVS), also said they were spending billions to expand production in the U.S. Other companies that have announced expansions include: On top of that, multiple companies said they were considering expanding U.S.-based production in light of Trump's tariffs. It's still too early to tell if those announcements add up to a manufacturing renaissance spurred by the tariffs.Many manufacturers were already looking to expand U.S. production in an effort to simplify supply lines and avoid a repeat of the logistical headaches of 2020, when COVID-19 shutdowns wreaked havoc on the production and transportation of various goods.In March and before the bulk of tariffs were announced, U.S. companies spent money on building factories at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $234 billion, nearly triple the $79 billion in February 2020, according to the Census Bureau. Economists doubted that the tariffs would result in a large-scale return of manufacturing jobs to the U.S., though many predicted that they could create at least some jobs.Goldman Sachs, for instance, predicted that the tariffs would lead to the creation of about 100,000 new jobs in manufacturing in the U.S. At the same time, however, they estimated the import taxes would cost 500,000 jobs. Tariffs come with some downsides for U.S. manufacturers, even as they protect some companies from foreign competition: firms that import parts or materials pay higher prices, and companies that export products are hurt by foreign retaliation to U.S. trade barriers, for instance.Some companies have already reportedly announced layoffs related to the tariffs, including Mack Trucks and Volvo.

Title: Monzo‚Äôs pivot from cool to corporate: ‚Äòfreshness is not about gimmicks‚Äô

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Monzo, Britain‚Äôs biggest digital bank, is still synonymous with its neon debit cards, extensive use of emojis, and free spending abroad. But it‚Äôs no longer just trying to be cool; it‚Äôs trying to become a major financial institution. That shift, from an upstart fintech beloved by millennials to a mature, sustainable business, is what makes this year a likely turning point. In a sit-down with this editor last week ‚Äî despite signs that Monzo is preparing to go public, along with new reports that something is in the works ‚Äî Monzo CEO TS Anil wouldn‚Äôt confirm that Monzo is listing this year. He suggested the building blocks are in place, though: profitability, product breadth, and just the right amount of AI. The numbers help tell the story. Monzo posted its first annual profit last year. In its 2024 annual report, it claimed 9.3 million personal account holders and more than 400,000 business customers. It‚Äôs also no longer reliant on interchange fees and overdrafts; lending, subscriptions, and business banking are now meaningful revenue streams. All this comes after a period marked by regulatory scrutiny and leadership turnover, developments that forced the company to grow up fast. Under Anil ‚Äî a banking veteran who joined Monzo in 2020 and soon after took over as CEO from co-founder Tom Blomfield ‚Äî Monzo is still flashy. Those hot coral cards remain a must for many younger banking customers. It has also become more disciplined about its growing product lineup. Monzo‚Äôs customers can now invest in mutual funds powered by BlackRock, for example, and track their existing mortgages from other lenders in their Monzo app. They can also use Monzo in the U.S., though most Americans have yet to hear of the brand. The question is whether that‚Äôs a problem, considering Monzo started amassing beta customers in the country six years ago. Certainly, it seemed fair to ask if Monzo needs to penetrate the U.S. market to become the global powerhouse that Anil is envisioning. During our sit-down, Anil suggested that‚Äôs not the case. He said that one in five adults in the U.K. now banks with Monzo ‚Äî in other words, there is market share Monzo has left to gain in its own backyard. (According to Anil, Monzo added 300,000 new users in April alone.) When questioned about U.S. expansion and the competitive landscape, Anil downplayed the challenge. ‚ÄúI think there are a few universal truths that apply,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMost people feel anxiety about their money, and that anxiety is independent of affluence ‚Ä¶ The second thing that holds true is that the incumbent industry has been built off of arbitraging customers and leveraging, in some fashion, customers‚Äô ignorance. Those are the insights that are helping us create the best features that would make sense in the U.S.; that‚Äôs the way we intend to double down.‚Äù During our talk, we also discussed whether Monzo could itself be construed as a legacy player in the not-too-distant future. After all, the company is now 10 years old, and AI is changing everything. We wanted to know whether Monzo worries about the rise of AI-native banks. ‚ÄúGosh no, we‚Äôre not a legacy player,‚Äù Anil said. ‚ÄúWe continue to operate at the bleeding edge of technology.‚Äù What would worry him, he continued, is if he ‚Äúsaw signs of complacency in terms of adopting new technology, or at least a curiosity about it. Those would be like bright, flashing red warning signs for me, but that‚Äôs the opposite of the company that we are.‚Äù As for the IPO that‚Äôs reportedly in the works, Anil said: ‚ÄúTo tell someone in the media ‚Äòdon‚Äôt believe everything you read in the media‚Äô is kind of like a dicey move to make, but yeah, please don‚Äôt believe everything you read in the press. We will be a great public company one day. We haven‚Äôt decided either when or where, let alone with whom.‚Äù If you‚Äôre curious to learn more, including about how Monzo keeps its marketing fresh, how it‚Äôs using AI, and the ways its engineers handle the adoption of new tech, watch our full chat below.

Title: Bargain butter brings in the crowds

Bicerra By Susan Edmunds and Louise Ternouth of RNZ It was organised chaos this week at Costco when another delivery of butter arrived. This butter is not just any butter - while the other supermarkets are selling a 500g slab for up to $10, Costco's butter is $9.99 for a kilogram. Jody Middleton was among the crowd waiting to stock up on Monday. "I have to say most people were pretty polite about it," she said. "We all knew what we were there for, Costco staff came out and had a chat before they even opened the door, answering questions." She said it was worthwhile braving the crowds. She buys 12 boxes of butter to last her bakery a week. If she bought her butter elsewhere it would have cost more than $800 more. "Compared to Woolworths, it's a saving of $838 for my business in a week." Butter prices have increased significantly over the past year. Stats NZ data showed last week that butter prices were up 65.3 percent in the 12 months to April. Costco butter gets snapped up almost as soon as it arrives on the shelves, and one Taranaki man is making the 750km return trip to get it. Kaleb Halverson decided to start making the trip from New Plymouth to Auckland to deliver Costco's 1kg blocks of butter at $9.99 to customers across the Taranaki region. He only had a few orders at first, but they kept rolling in. 'Butter Boy' Kaleb Halverson loads up on the 1kg blocks on his round trips to Costco in Auckland. Photo: Supplied Halverson makes the trip every few weeks, with the next trip set for May 29, and he told Checkpoint the idea started out as an idea from his mum. "After she made a trip up [to Costco] herself and came back and just thought why not get groceries from there and bring them back for everyone else." He brings back everything the store has to offer, but said butter is definitely top of the list. "It's our hot item at the moment every order has butter." Other popular products are cleaning products and snacks. At the moment he is just servicing the Taranaki region with orders made through his website. Halverson does the orders on top of his full-time job, so the 10-hour round trip is done all on a day off. "We wake up at 4am, pack the car with a bunch of chilly bins, drive up four and a-half hours. "We go and we buy what people have ordered, spend quite a few hours in Costco looking for everything, pack the car and just head back." While he has only done a few trips so far, on the last one he brought back 160 blocks of butter, storing it in chilly bins and chilly bags. Now renting a van, Kaleb said they can do 300 blocks with a limit of 15 blocks per customer and a fee of $2 a block which makes it $12 a kg. He said they were losing out on money on their last trip, so they had upped the service fee from $10 to $40 to cover the cost of petrol and van hire. Halverson told Checkpoint it was still economical for customers to beat the rising cost of supermarket groceries. "It seems to be worth it for people because we've got quite a few orders. "It's unaffordable at the moment just everything here." Kaleb said he would likely have to leave even earlier for his next trip to Costco, as customers were queueing to get their hands on the $9.99 1kg block before the store even opened. Rob Hamlin, a senior lecturer at Otago University, said it was not a price that any retailer supplied by Fonterra could match. Photo: Supplied/John Paul R. Bicerra "The price charged by Costco for packed and processed New Zealand butter at retail is only marginally more than the current price being achieved by Fonterra at auction for its unprocessed milk solids as a bulk unprocessed export commodity." The butter is supplied by Westland Milk Products, which is owned by Yili Group. He said butter was either a "whopping" loss leader for Costco or Yili was trying to undercut the market. Costco declined a request for comment and Westland did not respond. Retail consultant Chris Wilkinson of First Retail Group said Costco knew it had to have a pricing advantage to maintain its value proposition for shoppers. "So achieve that through a pack size that no other retailer offers, and by making a little margin off a lot of volume. "Also, as a global retailer they will be one of the world's largest purchasers of dairy product which will afford them better deals than any Australasian retailer could hope for. They are trading on the world market." He said the pack size was probably not ideal for many households. "And the fact that you still have to spend your $70 to get your membership each year‚Ä¶ all these things need to be considered." Chris Schulz, a senior investigative journalist at Consumer NZ, said it looked likely that the Costco butter was a loss leader. "The retailer's Facebook page is flooded with people speculating when the butter might be back on shelves, debating when to visit, and showing off when they do get it. "With butter costing at least $17 per kilo elsewhere else, Costco's pricing makes them look like the 'good guys' in contrast to our supermarket duopoly. Once they're in store, I'm sure many people are picking up roast chickens, cheese, and giant tubs of biscuits too." Fonterra said it could not comment on the pricing models of other retailers and consistent rises in global dairy commodity prices, could lead to an increase in the wholesale price of products like butter and cheese. "We are committed to keeping prices as low as possible, but they may sometimes need to be adjusted to reflect the increased costs."

Title: Eamon Ryan: Why has it taken so long to develop a greenway for Dublin Bay?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/05/20/eamon-ryan-why-has-it-taken-so-long-to-develop-a-greenway-for-dublin-bay/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
For more than 30 years, people have been campaigning for a safe walking and cycling route around Dublin Bay. It could transform our city, connecting northside and southside and restore the environment I grew up in, where children were much more free to wander and explore. It has been championed by many organisations and has a variety of names: the Sutton to Sandycove cycleway, the Coastal Trail or Dublin Bay Greenway. But its history tells a sad story of a lack of political will that is stopping us from fulfilling the true potential of our city. I remember in the mid 1990s heading out to Bull Island on a protest cycle organised by the Dublin Cycling Campaign. We were full of hope, only to be frustrated when a local resident opposing the plans had the ear of an influential councillor, and progress was delayed for years. Now the northside section is introduced, I don‚Äôt think a single person would want us to go back. Around the same time, we argued with D√∫n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to compulsory purchase a sliver of land beside Blackrock Dart station to remove one of the worst bottlenecks on the route. We were told it would take too long, and asked to be patient and allow an alternative approach to see the light of day. We are still waiting for that to this day. Fifteen years ago, things changed for the better when, despite budgetary hard times, money was allocated for the first proper greenway between Newport and Achill. It was built quickly and at low cost because local people wanted their children to be able to meet their neighbours without having to navigate the dangerous main road. A few years later, the 46km Waterford greenway became a similar success story and every council started to consider what might be possible. Under the last government, they were allocated the staff and funding to develop their plans. Transport Infrastructure Ireland was given the responsibility of connecting up a national greenway network, and the National Transport Authority had the key role of approving projects and allocating budgets. Their orders were to prioritise local needs, deliver at speed and avoid over-engineering solutions in order to keep costs down. During Covid, the best example came when the mix of a visionary community group, an enthusiastic council and a great local authority official built out the coastal cycle route between Blackrock and Sandycove. They did it in record time and at minimal cost, transforming D√∫n Laoghaire for the better. It would make you cry. Half a century to deliver a three-metre track along the 22km it takes to get around the bay However, things fell back again when Dublin City Council tried to emulate the same approach in Sandymount, only for the High Court to stop the trial. What made it worse was the chilling effect the decision had in every council across the country and that it took four years for the Court of Appeal to reverse the judicial decision in April. At last, it seemed that the Strand Road section was ready to be built. With Dublin Port also promising a safe route from Clontarf to the East link bridge by next year, an end-to-end Dublin Bay Greenway finally seemed to be at hand. However during the interim period, some Dublin City Councillors appear to have lost their nerve. They and some residents are arguing we should await the introduction of flood protection works before building the cycle path, which will likely delay things for another 20 years. It would make you cry. Half a century to deliver a three-metre track along the 22km it takes to get around the bay ‚Äì and all that delay because our political system is so attentive to local opposition, while the silent majority opinion that wants change remains by its very nature unheard. Public officials and regulators read the political temperature in a similar way and hold back on making hard decisions. Whatever you do, do nothing, becomes the order of the day. But what happened in D√∫n Laoghaire shows what is possible. The Dublin authorities are starting to deliver other game changing pathfinder projects and slowly but surely are improving things along the canals, Liffey, Tolka and Dodder. By joining up these various initiatives, we can reach a tipping point where Dublin once again becomes a great city to cycle and walk around and the perfect place to raise a child and call your home. Recent developments in Limerick, where a cycleway will connect the three universities, and on the Waterford Quay ‚Äì where a sustainable transport bridge is about to be installed, which will link the existing greenway to the Waterford to New Ross greenway ‚Äì give similar cause for hope. But you cannot force local authorities to make the necessary decisions. However, greater targeting of the active travel budget can change political dynamics. Those councils willing to build with ambition, speed and low-cost solutions should get most of the funding. Those who don‚Äôt should be asked to come up with more ambitious greenway plans and a plan to make it happen quickly. ¬© 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The Perils of Founder Worship

In the world of startups, founders are often elevated to near mythical status ‚Äì the force poised to disrupt entire industries. This adulation can grant founders extraordinary latitude in corporate control, especially in innovative and unregulated sectors like tech or crypto. However, when this reverence turns into ‚Äúfounder worship,‚Äù especially under the guise of doing good, it blinds investors and stakeholders to the absence of basic corporate governance. The consequences can be disastrous. The rise and fall of FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried (‚ÄúSBF‚Äù) offer a cautionary tale ‚Äì one where charisma, weak governance, and the veneer of altruism obscured its lack of corporate discipline. It is a stark illustration of what can happen when governance norms are subordinated to a visionary founder. At the heart of the FTX scandal lies a troubling paradox: The ‚Äúdo-gooderism‚Äù that made SBF a household name and the darling of the venture capital world also amplified founder exceptionalism and deferred governance in the name of innovation. In essence, FTX highlights the dangerous interplay between founder worship and a specific kind of moral narrative that led to a company operating without fundamental corporate safeguards and meaningful checks on the founder‚Äôs authority. The rise of effective altruism (‚ÄúEA‚Äù), a philosophical and social movement that emphasizes evidence-based philanthropy and the strategic use of wealth to maximize social good, permeates elite universities and the tech ecosystem. SBF‚Äôs association with EA lent him credibility and moral capital, particularly among sophisticated investors like Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, and Thoma Bravo LP. In theory, EA is aligned with ethical principles ‚Äì encouraging rich individuals to donate substantial portions of their income to causes that yield the greatest impact. The reality, however, was that EA served as a moral halo for SBF, evidence of his integrity and commitment to the greater good. SBF‚Äôs disheveled appearance reinforced the impression that he was intensely focused on building the first one trillion-dollar startup solely for EA goals. This impression created trust in SBF, which substituted for governance. FTX‚Äôs legitimacy was bolstered not by its compliance with best practices but by its founder‚Äôs supposed noblesse oblige, which was based on his commitment to EA. Venture capital-backed startups operate in a unique legal environment where private ordering allows early-stage companies to structure governance, allocate rights, and implement oversight according to their own preferences. The flexibility accorded to private companies contrasts with the discipline expected of public companies, where ownership and control are clearly separated and heavily regulated. In many ways, this flexibility allows startups to move fast, take risks, and innovate. Over time, oversight mechanisms such as investor board seats, staged financings, and protective provisions typically create checks. However, when a founder commands cultural and financial capital, as did SBF, these checks may be non-existent. Enamored by mission-driven founders, investors sometimes abdicate their responsibility to control and manage the startups through the board of directors and to vote on corporate policies. The promise of massive returns can distract the most seasoned venture capitalists to the extent that they ignore red flags. By deferring or waiving such checks, a company whose corporate governance is based on private ordering can falter or even collapse. In the case of FTX, a founder-centric structure, coupled with mythical ‚Äúdo gooderism,‚Äù became a shield against scrutiny and ultimately led to the company‚Äôs demise and SBF‚Äôs criminal conviction. FTX was not subject to even the most basic corporate controls. Financial audits, effective board oversight, and internal compliance mechanisms were absent. Investors overlooked these red flags based on SBF‚Äôs visionary status and mission-driven narrative. The failure was structural. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with believing in a founder‚Äôs mission, the law must be agnostic to motives, and governance safeguards must be applied at the appropriate times. As FTX shows, private ordering has its natural limits. Faith in founders is no substitute for the timely implementation of legal guardrails to ensure startups do not engage in crime or fraud. By cloaking SBF in moral credibility, he was allowed to operate with little to no constraints, which ultimately led to the implosion of FTX. To prevent the next FTX, we should tighten the boundaries of private ordering. There are several reforms worth considering: It is tempting to dismiss FTX and SBF as anomalies in an otherwise functional private ordering system. But the conditions that enabled FTX‚Äôs meteoric rise and precipitous fall are embedded in the culture of venture-backed startups where there is a bias toward disruption over discipline. Startups cannot be allowed to circumvent legal norms just because they are mission-driven. Founder worship should not override the legal structures that protect investors, employees, and the public. The FTX saga underscores that private ordering has limits. Ultimately, its success depends on the timely implementation of corporate governance measures to ensure legal accountability.

Fan, the Therese Maynard Chair in Business Law at LMU Loyola Law School, Los Angeles and affiliate professor at LMU‚Äôs College of Business Administration, and Xuan-Thao Nguyen, Pendleton Miller Chair in Law and the Director of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law.

By tapping the innovation of vLLM and the proven capabilities of Kubernetes, llm-d paves the way for distributed, scalable and high-performing AI inference across the expanded hybrid cloud, supporting any model, any accelerator, on any cloud environment and helping realize a vision of limitless AI potential. Brian Stevens senior vice president and AI CTO, Red Hat While training remains vital, the true impact of gen AI hinges on more efficient and scalable inference - the engine that transforms AI models into actionable insights and user experiences. According to Gartner, ‚ÄúBy 2028, as the market matures, more than 80% of data center workload accelerators will be specifically deployed for inference as opposed to training use.1‚Äù This underscores that the future of gen AI lies in the ability to execute. The escalating resource demands of increasingly sophisticated and larger reasoning models limits the viability of centralized inference and threatens to bottleneck AI innovation with prohibitive costs and crippling latency. Red Hat and its industry partners are directly confronting this challenge with llm-d, a visionary project that amplifies the power of vLLM to transcend single-server limitations and unlock production at scale for AI inference. Using the proven orchestration prowess of Kubernetes, llm-d integrates advanced inference capabilities into existing enterprise IT infrastructures. This unified platform empowers IT teams to meet the diverse serving demands of business-critical workloads, all while deploying innovative techniques to maximize efficiency and dramatically minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) associated with high-performance AI accelerators. llm-d delivers a powerful suite of innovations, highlighted by: This new open source project has already garnered the support of a formidable coalition of leading gen AI model providers, AI accelerator pioneers, and premier AI cloud platforms. CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research and NVIDIA are founding contributors, with AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda and Mistral AI as partners, underscoring the industry‚Äôs deep collaboration to architect the future of large-scale LLM serving. The llm-d community is further joined by founding supporters at the Sky Computing Lab at the University of California, originators of vLLM, and the LMCache Lab at the University of Chicago, originators of LMCache. Rooted in its unwavering commitment to open collaboration, Red Hat recognizes the critical importance of vibrant and accessible communities in the rapidly evolving landscape of gen AI inference. Red Hat will actively champion the growth of the llm-d community, fostering an inclusive environment for new members and fueling its continued evolution. The future of AI must be defined by limitless opportunity, not constrained by infrastructure silos. Red Hat sees a horizon where organizations can deploy any model, on any accelerator, across any cloud, delivering an exceptional, more consistent user experience without exorbitant costs. To unlock the true potential of gen AI investments, enterprises require a universal inference platform - a standard for more seamless, high-performance AI innovation, both today and in the years to come. Just as Red Hat pioneered the open enterprise by transforming Linux into the bedrock of modern IT, the company is now poised to architect the future of AI inference. vLLM‚Äôs potential is that of a linchpin for standardized gen AI inference, and Red Hat is committed to building a thriving ecosystem around not just the vLLM community but also llm-d for distributed inference at scale. The vision is clear: regardless of the AI model or the underlying accelerator or the deployment environment, Red Hat intends to make vLLM the definitive open standard for inference across the new hybrid cloud.

NVIDIA (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA‚Äôs Santa Clara office ‚Äúlaunching‚Äù into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA‚Äôs growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA‚Äôs ecosystem partners and described the industry‚Äôs opportunity as ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù and ‚Äúonce in a lifetime.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,‚Äù he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his "AI Factory" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about "AI Factories" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: "massively parallel architectures."I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled "Get Your MPA in Deep Learning." Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or "in parallel," without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the ‚ÄúMPAs‚Äù faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year "We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more."The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen‚Äôs long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse ‚Äúdigital twins‚Äù to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between ‚Äúagentic AI‚Äù and ‚Äúphysical AI‚Äù is mind-blowing. Agents are ‚Äúessentially digital robots,‚Äù Huang said, able to ‚Äúperceive, understand and plan.‚Äù To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world‚Äôs most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night..."AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúThese factories are essentially what we build today.‚Äù"They‚Äôre not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.‚ÄùI admit, "tokens" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink ‚Äúspine‚Äù and said ‚ÄúThis moves more traffic than the entire Internet." NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he‚Äôs not talking about Bitcoin.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with ‚ÄúLong‚Äù in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with ‚ÄúShort‚Äù in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day‚Äôs return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day‚Äôs returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day‚Äôs return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day‚Äôs returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses.

Each Fund with ‚ÄúShort‚Äù in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day‚Äôs return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day‚Äôs returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day‚Äôs return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day‚Äôs returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price.

Title: NVIDIA "AI Factories" -- More Than Clever Marketing?

NVIDIA (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA‚Äôs Santa Clara office ‚Äúlaunching‚Äù into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA‚Äôs growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA‚Äôs ecosystem partners and described the industry‚Äôs opportunity as ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù and ‚Äúonce in a lifetime.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,‚Äù he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his "AI Factory" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about "AI Factories" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: "massively parallel architectures."I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled "Get Your MPA in Deep Learning." Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or "in parallel," without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the ‚ÄúMPAs‚Äù faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year "We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more."The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen‚Äôs long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse ‚Äúdigital twins‚Äù to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between ‚Äúagentic AI‚Äù and ‚Äúphysical AI‚Äù is mind-blowing. Agents are ‚Äúessentially digital robots,‚Äù Huang said, able to ‚Äúperceive, understand and plan.‚Äù To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world‚Äôs most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night..."AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúThese factories are essentially what we build today.‚Äù"They‚Äôre not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.‚ÄùI admit, "tokens" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink ‚Äúspine‚Äù and said ‚ÄúThis moves more traffic than the entire Internet." NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he‚Äôs not talking about Bitcoin. Just released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys. They deem these tickers "Most Likely for Early Price Pops." Since 1988, the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of +23.0% per year. So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention.

He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA‚Äôs Santa Clara office ‚Äúlaunching‚Äù into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA‚Äôs growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA‚Äôs ecosystem partners and described the industry‚Äôs opportunity as ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù and ‚Äúonce in a lifetime.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,‚Äù he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his "AI Factory" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about "AI Factories" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: "massively parallel architectures."I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled "Get Your MPA in Deep Learning." Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or "in parallel," without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the ‚ÄúMPAs‚Äù faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year "We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more."The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen‚Äôs long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse ‚Äúdigital twins‚Äù to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between ‚Äúagentic AI‚Äù and ‚Äúphysical AI‚Äù is mind-blowing. Agents are ‚Äúessentially digital robots,‚Äù Huang said, able to ‚Äúperceive, understand and plan.‚Äù To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world‚Äôs most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night..."AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúThese factories are essentially what we build today.‚Äù"They‚Äôre not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.‚ÄùI admit, "tokens" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink ‚Äúspine‚Äù and said ‚ÄúThis moves more traffic than the entire Internet." NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016.

Title: The Business Roundtable is MIA Against Trump‚Äôs Attacks

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump recently attacked Walmart, the biggest private sector employer in the United States and the largest retailer in the world. Douglas McMillon, CEO of Walmart warned that the Trump Administration‚Äôs tariffs could drive cost increases. In response, President Donald Trump took to social media. ‚ÄúWalmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,‚Äù seethed the President. ‚ÄúBetween Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‚ÄòEAT THE TARIFFS,‚Äô and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I‚Äôll be watching, and so will your customers!!!‚Äù Advertisement Advertisement The rebuke comes the very same week that Trump chided revered Apple CEO Tim Cook for manufacturing in India and is merely the latest in a long line of attacks on some of America‚Äôs most iconic businesses. So far during his second term, Trump has lashed out at companies such as Amazon, Bank of America, and Boeing. And organizations including AT&T, Harley-Davidson, and Merck have not been immune to Trump‚Äôs wrath. However, business leaders are yet to collectively, and definitively, stand up to him. Many completely non-political CEOs saw their firms suffer Trump-initiated stock plunges as they made prudent decisions on how to guide their companies around reckless universal trade sanctions. As Trump‚Äôs tariff tantrums threaten to plunge the American economy off a cliff‚Äîamidst significant price increases, large layoffs, plummeting business and consumer confidence, and frozen capital investments across industries‚ÄîCEOs know they need to speak truth to power. But we‚Äôve heard from dozens of Fortune 100 CEOs that they are having a hard time breaking through to President Trump, and conveying the very real dangers facing their businesses, their shareholders, their employees, and their communities. Furthermore, even though 90% of CEOs agree that tariffs are backfiring, they are fearful that if they speak out on their own, they will turn into the next targets of a capricious, vindictive President‚Äîas Walmart found out the hard way. Trump fears collective action, and relies on pitting rivals against one another through a divide-and-conquer approach. When business groups stand by in passive inaction when individual CEOs get pummeled, they cede the moral and strategic imperative to Trump‚Äôs impulsive whims‚Äîultimately leaving business leaders twisting in the wind. Some trade groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Chamber of Progress‚Äîalong with other specialized industry groups from the automotive sector to the pharmaceutical industry‚Äîhave tried to pick up the pieces. However, there are many who wonder why the Business Roundtable, a D.C.-based lobbying firm and association of more than 200 leading CEOs, seems to be missing in action. Indeed, why have they not played a greater role in catalyzing collective action beyond putting out perfunctory statements and purported behind-the-scenes lobbying? This muted response follows other high-profile disappointments from the Business Roundtable in the Trump era, including during his first term. In August 2017, following Trump‚Äôs horrifying defense of neo-Nazis who attacked peaceful counterdemonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., the American business community stood together. The highly-regarded CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier led the charge. In his resignation letter he wrote, ‚ÄúAs C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.‚Äù The son of a well-read custodian, Frazier grew up in North Philadelphia and became one of few black Fortune 500 chief executives. Trump predictably attacked him, which immediately backfired. Over the next several days, CEOs who had once shunned politics came to Frazier‚Äôs vocal defense, including the heads of Walmart, Intel, BlackRock, and IBM. When Frazier exited the President‚Äôs Business Advisory Group, he set off a high-profile stampede of exits. Frazier‚Äôs peer CEOs walked out in solidarity, triggering the disbanding of the two of President Trump's business advisory councils: the Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum. At the time, many CEOs were frustrated that the Business Roundtable remained relatively passive‚Äîespecially amidst an era of perceived antitrust politicization, with Trump deputies holding up the Time Warner-AT&T deal on specious grounds for 18 months. Similarly, when in November 2020, President Trump refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat, 22 CEOs, frustrated with inaction by the Business Roundtable, asked me to convene an immediate Zoom call for 100 of the nation‚Äôs largest CEOs. All showed up‚Äîfrom pharma to finance, advertising to airlines, consumer goods to consulting. During this ‚ÄúChamber of Conscience‚Äù meeting, these business leaders stood up for the importance of certified elections and also certified the truth‚Äîmeeting for four sessions through the presidential transition under the banner of Business Leaders for National Unity. That silence of the Business Roundtable is a far cry from why it was created. I personally knew the highly engaged, politically diverse founding generation of Business Roundtable members‚Äîranging from Reginald Jones of GE, Clifton Garvin of Exxon, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, George Weyerhaeuser of his eponymous timberland firm, Al Casey of American Airlines, Roger Smith of GM, Jim Burke of Johnson & Johnson, and Roy Vagelos of Merck‚Äîand they set up the Business Roundtable explicitly as a vehicle for collective action for CEOs to tackle public policy issues. As Trump attacks our nation‚Äôs most iconic enterprises, the Business Roundtable needs to return to its founding principles, purpose, and moral clarity so that CEOs are not left dangling in the wind all alone and defenseless while Trump picks them off individually. CEOs grappling with how to break through to a mercurial President as they watch their enterprises and the broader economy teeter off the ledge know there is strength in collective action‚Äîlest they become Trump‚Äôs next target. ¬© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

Title: 'Deeply painful': Nvidia CEO says a new chip ban has cost it $15 billion

President Donald Trump‚Äôs escalating trade war has cost Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) $15 billion in business, the company‚Äôs CEO said Monday. Jensen Huang made the comments during an interview with tech analyst Ben Thompson at the Computex trade show in Taipei. He said that America‚Äôs restrictions against exporting its H20 chips in China has had an unprecedented impact on the firm. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve written off ‚Äî I think it‚Äôs $5.5 billion. No company in history has ever written off that much inventory, so this additional ban on Nvidia‚Äôs H20 is deeply painful,‚Äù Huang said. He continued: It‚Äôs ‚Äúenormously costly. Not only am I losing $5.5 billion, we wrote off $5.5 billion, we walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably ‚Äî what is it? ‚Äî $3 billion worth of taxes.‚Äù Nvidia designed the H20 chip to comply with the Biden administration‚Äôs export rules. But those rules became even stricter under Trump and barred Nvidia from selling the chips in China, even after the company pared down their capabilities. While this is the first time Huang has cited a dollar amount publicly, it shouldn‚Äôt come as a huge surprise. Wall Street analysts had estimated that Nvidia would suffer a hit of between $10 and $16 billion as a result of the ban. Nvidia is the world‚Äôs most valuable chipmaker with a market capitalization of about $3.3 trillion. But its stock is down 2.1% so far this year amid the ongoing trade war. Meanwhile, while the U.S. limits its tech exports to the country, Chinese tech firms have put renewed focus on manufacturing chips in-house. Xiaomi said Monday thatit will invest at least $6.9 billion over the next decade to develop its own chips. In April, Huawei announced that it was getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia. Beijing has slammed the U.S. approach and Trump‚Äôs attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. Earlier this month, China‚Äôs foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries ‚Äúat the expense of China,‚Äù framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. ‚ÄîCatherine Baab contributed to this article.

Title: AI and Work (Some Predictions)
URL: https://calnewport.com/ai-and-work-some-predictions/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T17:41:52Z
Full Content:
One of the main topics of this newsletter is the quest to cultivate sustainable and meaningful work in a digital age. Given this objective, it‚Äôs hard to avoid confronting the furiously disruptive potentials of AI. I‚Äôve been spending a lot time in recent years, in my roles as a digital theorist and technology journalist, researching and writing about this topic, so it occurred to me that it might be useful to capture in one place all of my current thoughts about the intersection of AI and work. The obvious caveat applies: these predictions will shift ‚Äî perhaps even substantially ‚Äî as this inherently unpredictable sector continues to evolve. But here‚Äôs my current best stab at what‚Äôs going on now, what‚Äôs coming soon, and what‚Äôs likely just hype. Let‚Äôs get to it‚Ä¶ When generative AI made its show-stopping debut a few years ago, the smart money was on text production becoming the first killer app. For example, business users, it was thought, would soon outsource much of the tedious communication that makes up their day ‚Äî meeting summaries, email, reports ‚Äî into AI tools. A fair amount of this is happening, especially when it comes to lengthy utilitarian communication where the quality doesn‚Äôt matter much. I recently attended a men‚Äôs retreat, for example, and it was clear that the organizer had used ChatGPT to create the final email summarizing the weekend schedule. And why not? It got the job done and saved some time. It‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear, however, that for most people the act of writing in their daily lives isn‚Äôt a major problem that needs to be solved, which is capping the predicted ubiquity of this use case. (A survey of internet users found that only around 5.4% had used ChatGPT to help write emails and letters. And this includes the many who maybe experimented with this capability once or twice before moving on.) The application that has instead leaped ahead to become the most exciting and popular use of these tools is smart search. If you have a question, instead of turning to Google you can query a new version of ChatGPT or Claude. These models can search the web to gather information, but unlike a traditional search engine, they can also process the information they find and summarize for you only what you care about. Want the information presented in a particular format, like a spreadsheet or a chart? A high-end model like GPT-4o can do this for you as well, saving even more extra steps. Smart search has become the first killer app of the generative AI era because, like any good killer app, it takes an activity most people already do all the time ‚Äî typing search queries into web sites ‚Äî and provides a substantially, almost magically better experience. This feels similar to electronic spreadsheets conquering paper ledger books or email immediately replacing voice mail and fax. I would estimate that around 90% of the examples I see online right now from people exclaiming over the potential of AI are people conducting smart searches. This behavioral shift is appearing in the data. A recent survey conducted by Future found that 27% of US-based respondents had used AI tools such as ChatGPT instead of a traditional search engine. From an economic perspective, this shift matters. Earlier this month, the stock price for Alphabet, the parent company for Google, fell after an Apple executive revealed that Google searches through the Safari web browser had decreased over the previous two months, likely due to the increased use of AI tools. Keep in mind, web search is a massive business, with Google earning over $175 billion from search ads in 2023 alone. In my opinion, becoming the new Google Search is likely the best bet for a company like OpenAI to achieve profitability, even if it‚Äôs not as sexy as creating AGI or automating all of knowledge work (more on these applications later). The other major success story for generative AI at the moment is computer programming. Individuals with only rudimentary knowledge of programming languages can now produce usable prototypes of simple applications using tools like ChatGPT, and somewhat more advanced projects with AI-enhanced agent-style helpers like Roo Code. This can be really useful for quickly creating tools for personal use or seeking to create a proof-of-concept for a future product. The tech incubator Y Combinator, for example, made waves when they reported that a quarter of the start-ups in their Winter 2025 batch generated 95% or more of their product‚Äôs codebases using AI. How far can this automated coding take us? An academic computer scientist named Judah Diament recently went viral for noting that the ability for novice users to create simple applications isn‚Äôt new. There have been systems dedicated to this purpose for over four decades, from HyperCard to VisualBasic to Flash. As he elaborates: ‚ÄúAnd, of course, they all broke down when anything slightly complicated or unusual needs to be done (as required by every real, financially viable software product or service).‚Äù This observation created major backlash ‚Äî as does most expressions of AI skepticism these days ‚Äî but Diament isn‚Äôt wrong. Despite recent hyperbolic statements by tech leaders, many professional programmers aren‚Äôt particularly worried that their jobs can be replicated by language model queries, as so much of what they do is experience-based architecture design and debugging, which are unrelated skills for which we currently have no viable AI solution. Software developers do, however, use AI heavily: not to produce their code from scratch, but instead as helper utilities. Tools like GitHub‚Äôs Copilot are integrated directly into the environments in which these developers already work, and make it much simpler to look up obscure library or AI calls, or spit out tedious boilerplate code. The productivity gains here are notable. Programming without help from AI is rapidly becoming increasingly rare. Language model-based AI systems can respond to prompts in pretty amazing ways. But if we focus only on outputs, we underestimate another major source of these models‚Äô value: their ability to understand human language. This so-called natural language processing ability is poised to transform how we use software. There is a push at the moment, for example, led by Microsoft and its Copilot product (not to be confused with GitHub Copilot), to use AI models to provide natural language interfaces to popular software. Instead of learning complicated sequences of clicks and settings to accomplish a task in these programs, you‚Äôll be able to simply ask for what you need; e.g., ‚ÄúHey Copilot, can you remove all rows from this spreadsheet where the dollar amount in column C is less than $10 dollars then sort everything that remains by the names in Column A? Also, the font is too small, make it somewhat larger.‚Äù Enabling novice users to access to expert-level features in existing software will aggregate into huge productivity gains. As a bonus, the models required to understand these commands don‚Äôt have to be nearly as massive and complicated as the current cutting-edge models that the big AI companies use to show off their technology. Indeed, they might be small enough to run locally on devices, making them vastly cheaper and more efficient to operate. Don‚Äôt sleep on this use case. Like smart search, it‚Äôs also not as sexy as AGI or full automation, but I‚Äôm increasingly convinced that within the next half-decade or so, informally-articulated commands are going to emerge as one of the dominate interfaces to the world of computation. One of the more attention-catching storylines surrounding AI at the moment is the imminent arrival of so-called agents which will automate more and more of our daily work, especially in the knowledge sectors once believed to be immune from machine encroachment. Recent reports imply that agents are a major part of OpenAI‚Äôs revenue strategy for the near future. The company imagines business customers paying up to $20,000 a month for access to specialized bots that can perform key professional tasks. It‚Äôs the projection of this trend that led Elon Musk to recently quip: ‚ÄúIf you want to do a job that‚Äôs kinda like a hobby, you can do a job. But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.‚Äù But progress in creating these agents has recently slowed. To understand why requires a brief snapshot of the current state of generative AI technology‚Ä¶ Not long ago, there was a belief in so-called scaling laws that argued, roughly speaking, that as you continued to increase the size of language models, their abilities would continue to rapidly increase. For a while this proved true: GPT-2 was much better than the original GPT, GPT-3 was much better than GPT-2, and GPT-4 was a big improvement on GPT-3. The hope was that by continuing to scale these models, you‚Äôd eventually get to a system so smart and capable that it would achieve something like AGI, and could be used as the foundation for software agents to automate basically any conceivable task. More recently, however, these scaling laws have begun to falter. Companies continue to invest massive amounts of capital in building bigger models, trained on ever-more GPUs crunching ever-larger data sets, but the performance of these models stopped leaping forward as much as they had in the past. This is why the long-anticipated GPT-5 has not yet been released, and why, just last week, Meta announced they were delaying the release of their newest, biggest model, as its capabilities were deemed insufficiently better than its predecessor. In response to the collapse of the scaling laws, the industry has increasingly turned its attention in another direction: tuning existing models using reinforcement learning. Say, for example, you want to make a model that is particularly good at math. You pay a bunch of math PhDs $100 an hour to come up with a lot of math problems with step-by-step solutions. You then take an existing model, like GPT-4, and feed it these problems one-by-one, using reinforcement learning techniques to tell it exactly where it‚Äôs getting certain steps in its answers right or wrong. Over time, this tuned model will get better at solving this specific type of problem. This technique is why OpenAI is now releasing multiple, confusingly-named models, each seemingly optimized for different specialties. These are the result of distinct tunings. They would have preferred, of course, to simply produce a GPT-5 model that could do well on all of these tasks, but that hasn‚Äôt worked out as they hoped. This tuning approach will continue to develop interesting tools, but it will be much more piecemeal and hit-or-miss than what was anticipated when we still believed in scaling laws. Part of the difficulty is that this approach depends on finding the right data for each task you want to tackle. Certain problems, like math, computer programming, and logical reasoning, are well-suited for tuning as they can be described by pairs of prompts and correct answers. But this is not the case for many other business activities, which can be esoteric and bespoke to a given context. This means many useful activities will remain un-automatable by language model agents into the foreseeable future. I once said that the real Turing Test for our current age is an AI system that can successfully empty my email inbox, a goal that requires the mastery of any number of complicated tasks. Unfortunately for all of us, this is not a test we‚Äôre poised to see passed any time soon. The Free Press recently published an article titled ‚ÄúAI Will Change What it Means to Be Human. Are We Ready?‚Äù. It summarized a common sentiment that has been feverishly promoted by Silicon Valley in recent years: that AI is on the cusp of changing everything in unfathomably disruptive ways. As the article argues: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asserted in a recent talk that GPT-5 will be smarter than all of us. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei described the powerful AI systems to come as ‚Äúa country of geniuses in a data center.‚Äù These are not radical predictions. They are nearly here. But here‚Äôs the thing: these are radical predictions. Many companies tried to build the equivalent of the proposed GPT-5 and found that continuing to scale up the size of their models isn‚Äôt yielding the desired results. As described above, they‚Äôre left tuning the models they already have for specific tasks that are well-described by synthetic data sets. This can produce cool demos and products, but it‚Äôs not a route to a singular ‚Äúgenius‚Äù system that‚Äôs smarter than humans in some general sense. Indeed, if you look closer at the rhetoric of the AI prophets in recent months, you‚Äôll see a creeping awareness that, in a post-scaling law world, they no longer have a convincing story for how their predictions will manifest. A recent Nick Bostrom video, for example, which (true to character) predicts Superintelligence might happen in less than two years (!), adds the caveat that this outcome will require key ‚Äúunlocks‚Äù from the industry, which is code for we don‚Äôt know how to build systems that achieve this goal, but, hey, maybe someone will figure it out! (The AI centrist Gary Marcus subsequently mocked Bostrom by tweeting: ‚Äúfor all we know, we could be just one unlock and 3-6 weeks away from levitation, interstellar travel, immortality, or room temperature superconductors, or perhaps even all four!‚Äù) Similarly, if you look closer at AI 2027, the splashy new doomsday manifesto which argues that AI might eliminate humanity as early as 2030, you won‚Äôt find a specific account of what type of system might be capable of such feats of tyrannical brilliance. The authors instead sidestep the issue by claiming that within the next year or so, the language models we‚Äôre tuning to solve computer programming tasks will somehow come up with, on their own, code that implements breakthrough new AI technology that mere humans cannot understand. This is an incredible claim. (What sort of synthetic data set do they imagine being able to train a language model to crack the secrets of human-level intelligence?) It‚Äôs the technological equivalent of looking at the Wright Brother‚Äôs Flyer in 1903 and thinking, ‚Äúwell, if they could figure this out so quickly, we should have space travel cracked by the end of the decade.‚Äù The current energized narratives around AGI and Superintelligence seem to be fueled by a convergence of three factors: (1) the fact that scaling laws did apply for the first few generations of language models, making it easy and logical to imagine them continuing to apply up the exponential curve of capabilities in the years ahead; (2) demos of models tuned to do well on specific written tests, which we tend to intuitively associate with intelligence; and (3) tech leaders pounding furiously on the drums of sensationalism, knowing they‚Äôre rarely held to account on their predictions. But here‚Äôs the reality: We are not currently on a trajectory to genius systems. We might figure this out in the future, but the ‚Äúunlocks‚Äù required will be sufficiently numerous and slow to master that we‚Äôll likely have plenty of clear signals and warning along the way. So, we‚Äôre not out of the woods on these issues, but at the same time, humanity is not going to be eliminated by the machines in 2030 either. In the meantime, the breakthroughs that are happening, especially in the world of work, should be both exciting and worrisome enough on their own for now. Let‚Äôs grapple with those first. #### For more of my thoughts on AI, check out my New Yorker archive and my podcast (in recent months, I often discuss AI in the third act of the show). For more on my thoughts on technology and work more generally, check out my recent books on the topic: Slow Productivity, A World Without Email, and Deep Work. I agree with natural language commands to be an awesome use-case that people are sleeping on! I have two examples of messing around with ai where I realized if they just got a little bit better at this, it would change everything. First, ai can already identify information in photos. I uploaded a picture of myself to ChatGPT and it started describing how I look. That was a neat trick. But once you can upload screenshots and it can read, transcribe, or act on every piece of information in the photo? Hey here is a screenshot of my spreadsheet, tell me how to fix it. Hey here is a screenshot of a web design that I like, please convert it into code for me. Second, using Cursor.ai IDE, I can ask the agents how to use the program and where things are in the program and of course it can write code, save files, delete files, make directories, prompt commands, and be a search engine all in one. I didn‚Äôt know where some of the stuff in the program was and it just told me where it was. I didn‚Äôt know how everything worked in the program and it just told me how it works. And then of course it also codes and makes commands for everything I ask. So imagine a future where in every single program you use on the computer, you can quickly screenshot it and ask how to do something or how to fix something and it tells you exactly how to do it, or just does it for you. Now I feel like all the talk about real agents is kind of hyped up? Like just because my IDE can do IDE tasks for me people seem to think agents are going to do my taxes for me and answer all my emails for me automatically. But I think that‚Äôs kind of just a dream. ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù seems to just be the new term for a long complicated process that had been automated. But I bet instead of the ‚Äúagent‚Äù figuring all that out for itself, it‚Äôs going to happen the old fashioned way, where a bunch of engineers work very hard to automate a task. You know, like we‚Äôve been doing for decades already. The photo analysis example is a great one. I think of that as part of the general idea of a super search, where now, the sources for its answer isn‚Äôt just the web, but also other things, like photos, or files on your local machine, etc. Sort of like a Google for everything which is, it seems to me, likely where the bulk of the money is actually waiting in the AI race. I agree that superintelligence in 2030 is very unlikely, and it‚Äôs good to communicate that. But I think superintelligence in 2040 is totally in the territory of ‚Äúmaybe, maybe not, who knows‚Äù, and by not emphasizing or mentioning that, you‚Äôre burying the lede. Anything that humans, and groups of humans, and societies of humans, can do, can also be done by code running on chips. After all, the human brain is a machine that runs an algorithm. No one knows the algorithm, but as soon as someone figures it out, they could run it on chips, like any other algorithm. Then we‚Äôd get AIs that can autonomously found and run billion-dollar companies, that can invent science and technology and language from scratch, and all the other crazy sci-fi-sounding stuff. And there could be hundreds of millions of such AIs, thinking much faster than humans, etc. Why do I say that ‚Äúsuperintelligence by 2040‚Äù is in ‚Äúmaybe, maybe not, who knows‚Äù territory? Well, LLMs didn‚Äôt exist as recently as 2018. The entirety of deep learning was a backwater as recently as 2012. You can say that LLMs are not on the path to superintelligence, and as it happens, I‚Äôll agree with you. But 15 years is evidently more than enough time for the AI research community to have pivoted to something entirely different and poured billions of dollars, and tens of thousands of person-years, into polishing and optimizing it. As an analogy, suppose a giant fleet of alien ships were definitely due to arrive on Earth at some point, but we didn‚Äôt know when, and 15-40 years seemed like a reasonable guess. But some people were going around saying the aliens would definitely arrive in <5 years. Then it would be good to correct those people! But it would be bad to imply that therefore we shouldn‚Äôt be thinking about and preparing for the alien invasion right now. The death of Moore‚Äôs Law (measuring transistors) was the birth of LLM scaling / virtual quantity (measuring virtual parameters). The death of LLM scaling / virtual quantity will be virtual quality. The manifestation of the thing that is manifesting has been going on for 70+ years and there have been dozens of barriers that were said to be impassible, but the manifestation has always found a new thing. Now that the manifestation has manifested the ability to create PhD‚Äôs out of thin air to work for its manifestation, now is when you are going to doubt it ?? Humanity is a small thing, and the physical universe is a shallow one. Now some wave from a bigger pond is washing into ours. Sadhguru has a nice take on this current affair https://youtu.be/uGwKU1jaDsY?si=J29PtlB8BuB8iTnx&t=2525 What I am most anxious to see play out is how the next generation of youth engage with Ai tools. The kids who are under 12 today, how will they perform in a world of automation having never known anything other than Ai ubiquity? As a parallel example, take social media. When Facebook launched, a generation of Xennials and first-wave Millennials initially used it as a tool to complement their pre-existing social lives (think wall posts and group events). In other words, when a generation of people with pre-established social skills adopt a new comms tech/device, they see it as complementary to their social world. They lived through the transition. It‚Äôs not until later that we see Gen Z struggling with social media, struggling to establish social skills through the devices and platforms. Why? Because Gen Z didn‚Äôt grow up in a world without them. They didn‚Äôt understand that those social apps were never meant to create social skills and connections, but only to complement the skills and connections you already had. So going back to Ai, many of the people adopting Ai tools and praising their capabilities‚Äìthose people already had critical thinking skills and domain expertise in the first place! They are using it to complement their pre-existing work! What is completely unpredictable is how the untrained, unknowledgeable generation of youth coming up next will be able to perform in a world in which whatever skills and knowledge they manage to pick up in school are basically deemed low value because, well, ‚ÄúAi can already do that‚Äù.

Title: The 6 Groceries Smart Meal Planners Always Buy in Bulk
URL: https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/the-6-groceries-smart-meal-planners-always-buy-in-bulk/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T17:28:00Z

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement We asked experts about the best foods to stock up on to save money and trips to the supermarket. We spoke with a meal planning expert to find out which foods are smartest to buy in bulk. Grocery prices continue to be a major concern for many Americans. A recent survey by CNET confirms that rising food costs remain the top source of sticker shock‚Äîand I can relate. Over time, we've explored various strategies to stretch your grocery budget, from using food-saving apps like Flashfood, to comparing name brands versus store brands, and even asking whether shopping at Trader Joe's really saves money. Another tried-and-true strategy? Buying in bulk. Stocking up on everyday staples at warehouse stores like Costco can lead to significant savings. In fact, after crunching the numbers, I found that the average person could potentially save around $1,000 a year by buying in bulk. But bulk shopping isn't always simple. You'll need to think about storage space, shelf life and whether you'll actually use what you buy. As Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, puts it: "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: A great deal isn't a deal if you end up throwing half of it away. Read more: Here's What an Expert Told Me About Food Expiration Dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $8, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $13 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $23, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

Additionally, it responds instantly to any accident or special incident. - David Barber√° Costarrosa, Beeping Fulfilment The distributed decision-making of honeybees is a strong example of biological intelligence. Through decentralized communication, bees make complex collective decisions, such as choosing their new hive. AI and robotics algorithms draw inspiration from nature‚Äôs teamwork, demonstrated by swarm intelligence, which provides efficient solutions to real-world problems. - Roshan Mahant, LaunchIT Corp. Ants build cities, farm aphids and coordinate like tiny logistics pros‚Äîall without a boss. That decentralized brilliance inspired algorithms behind things like traffic flow and delivery routing. Turns out, a little chaos with clear rules scales beautifully. Nature‚Äôs ‚Äúdumb‚Äù systems often outsmart centralized control‚Äîsometimes the smartest move is letting go (strategically). - Joel Frenette, TravelFun.Biz Mycorrhizal networks‚Äîthe ‚Äúwood-wide web‚Äù‚Äîfascinate me. Through fungal connections, trees share resources and warnings, showing a form of collective intelligence. This challenges brain-centered definitions of intelligence and reveals the deep interdependence in ecosystems‚Äîan insight vital for sustainability. - Mohit Menghnani, Twilio Tesla‚Äôs self-driving cars are a powerful example of living intelligence, learning and evolving with real-time data. Their neural network adapts continuously, making decisions that improve over time. This dynamic AI system is transforming transportation and holds broad implications for industries like healthcare, manufacturing and logistics, offering new potential for automation and efficiency. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The human brain‚Äôs ability to recognize patterns and make decisions is a prime example of living intelligence that has deeply influenced the field of artificial intelligence. The brain‚Äôs ability to process complex data through interconnected neurons, for instance, has inspired the development of neural networks, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition and natural language processing. - Udit Mehrotra, Amazon Urban crows in Japan drop nuts onto crosswalks, timing traffic to crack shells and safely retrieve food‚Äîan elegant display of living intelligence improvising and adapting to an urban environment.

The system enables customers to purchase items without waiting in lines by integrating AI technology with sensors and computer vision. The retail industry is being transformed through this seamless shopping experience toward fully autonomous and personalized, frictionless retail commerce. - Amit Ojha One real-world example of living intelligence is autonomous threat detection in financial networks using AI and behavioral analytics. I have seen systems flag and isolate anomalies in real time, without human intervention. The broader impact is clear: It proves that living intelligence can adapt, learn continuously and defend complex environments with speed and precision. - Srikanth Bellamkonda Over 10 years ago, Zappos impressed me with a smart checkout prompt: After I ordered shoes, its system suggested rubber boots because of the rain forecast around my delivery date. It blended personal context with weather data‚Äîa great early example of living intelligence, long before the likes of ChatGPT normalized the use of AI. - Agur J√µgi, Pipedrive A standout example of living intelligence is Costa Group‚Äôs use of computer-vision-powered robotic pollinators in tomato greenhouses. In place of bees, these AI-driven robots improved yield by up to 15%. This showcases how smart automation can solve ecological and regulatory challenges, opening doors for sustainable, tech-enabled agriculture worldwide. - Tarun Eldho Alias, Neem Inc. Humans are being inspired by slime mold's strategic mastery. Physarum polycephalum is a brainless single-celled organism that can solve mazes and optimize nutrient pathways, challenging our notions of intelligence. Its ability to make decisions and adapt to complex environments suggests cognition may be more distributed than we think. It‚Äôs inspiring developments in decentralized computing, robotics and urban planning. - Cristian Randieri, Intellisystem Technologies An AI tool that analyzes credit risk adapts to real-time life events like layoffs or health bills. Analyzing nontraditional signals can redefine lending fairness. This living intelligence bridges empathy and economics, hinting at a future where automated finance tools react with humanlike instinct. - Jitender Jain

Title: Big Tech's next AI bet is a 'watershed moment,' analyst says ‚Äî and a $1 trillion opportunity

The Middle East could rapidly become the next major frontier for artificial intelligence, and U.S. tech giants are lining up to cash in. In what Wedbush analysts are calling a ‚Äúwatershed moment‚Äù for Big Tech, recent developments in the region mean the AI boom might be rapidly shifting its center of gravity. A wave of investment in AI infrastructure across Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is signaling an acceleration in U.S. tech companies‚Äô expansion abroad. According to a Monday note from analysts led by Dan Ives, the region is poised to become one of the most important global markets for AI over the next decade, potentially adding over $1 trillion. ‚ÄúWe believe the market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years,‚Äù the note said, ‚Äúand this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names in our view.‚Äù Wedbush wrote that it is becoming ‚Äúcrystal clear‚Äù that the ‚ÄúAI Revolution has found its next major area of penetration...the Middle East.‚Äù This inflection point comes on the heels of President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent high-profile visit to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, which focused heavily on U.S. involvement in the region‚Äôs ambitious AI infrastructure plans. Among the standout deals: Humain, a Saudi-backed AI startup, announced it will deploy 18,000 of Nvidia‚Äôs (NVDA-1.54%) cutting-edge AI chips to power a 500-megawatt data center ‚Äî one of the largest of its kind. ‚Äú[That announcement] is the start of a new era of growth for the US tech sector and a gamechanger for the industry,‚Äù the note said. ‚ÄúRiyadh and UAE will be a major buyer of AI chips, software, autonomous/robotics, and datacenters over the next decade.‚Äù For decades, the Gulf region has leveraged its oil wealth to diversify into new markets: finance, tourism, and energy-transition technologies. But this focus on AI might mark its most ambitious pivot yet. Governments in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi aren‚Äôt just buying chips ‚Äî they‚Äôre buying a future in which the Middle East becomes a global AI hub. At the core of this strategy is a growing alliance between Gulf governments and U.S. technology companies. Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%), Palantir (PLTR+1.01%), and Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) are all positioning themselves in the region to be key players in what could be full-throttle AI buildout. The sharp pivot to the Middle East comes amid tensions between the U.S. and China. While Saudi Arabia is rolling out the red carpet for Nvidia‚Äôs latest-generation chips, China is seeing growing restrictions even on underpowered GPUs such as the H20, as the U.S. attempts to restrain the country‚Äôs domestic AI ambitions. This divergence is shaping up to be a central theme in the larger AI race. Wedbush characterized the Trump administration‚Äôs positioning as a ‚Äúglobal game of high-stakes poker‚Äù to isolate China while turbocharging U.S. influence in the Gulf through technology. ‚ÄúChina is clearly taking notice and this adds to the drama of the broader US/China tariff/trade talks over the coming months,‚Äù Wedbush said. The note said these developments are a ‚Äúbullish indicator that further shows the US tech‚Äôs lead in this 4th Industrial Revolution.‚Äù And at the center of it all is Nvidia ‚Äî and the ‚ÄúGodfather of AI,‚Äù as Wedbush calls CEO Jensen Huang ‚Äî cementing its position not just as a hardware company, but as a geopolitical force shaping the future of artificial intelligence.

Title: AvalonBay braces for signs of trouble in DC rental market

Let Multifamily Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. CEO Ben Schall also said the softness in the REIT‚Äôs expansion markets could provide opportunities to add assets. On AvalonBay Communities' first-quarter earnings call earlier this month, CEO Ben Schall wasted little time before addressing some of the volatility in the current economy. ‚ÄúRecognizing that we are in a period of heightened uncertainty regarding the impact of policy actions on the broader economy, I want to start by emphasizing that we are very well positioned, given our portfolio makeup, our unique set of strategic capabilities and our preeminent balance sheet, to continue to deliver superior earnings growth for shareholders,‚Äù Schall said on the REIT‚Äôs earnings call. AVB, whose home is in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Arlington, Virginia, has a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the localized impacts of the Trump administration's policies, specifically those limiting federal funding and mandating government layoffs. AVB Chief Operating Officer Sean Breslin said the D.C. Metro area continues to perform as expected, and occupancy and availability align with last year's levels. Lease breaks have also fallen year over year over the previous few months. But there are some signs of trouble. ‚ÄúOver the last few months, we've started to hear from prospects and residents about the level of uncertainty in the job market, but to date, the velocity of activity and pricing in the region has not been impacted,‚Äù Breslin said. ‚ÄúAbout 12% of our resident base is employed by the government, so we're certainly monitoring the pace of leasing, renewal acceptance and other metrics very closely.‚Äù AVB covered more than just its home market in its earnings release and call. Here‚Äôs more on what‚Äôs happening in its established and expansion regions. AVB is projecting that new deliveries will fall to 80 basis points of existing stock in 2026, which is roughly 45,000 units across its coastal established markets, according to Schall. That level of new deliveries hasn‚Äôt been seen in 20 years. ‚ÄúOur established regions are benefiting from several tailwinds, including strong occupancy and very limited new deliveries this year and in 2026, which should support healthy pricing power,‚Äù Schall said. In Seattle, return-to-office mandates from Amazon, Microsoft and others; relatively strong job growth; and limited new supply in suburban markets have helped AVB. The REIT‚Äôs properties are more than 96% occupied across the Northern California region, which is about 50 basis points higher than last year. ‚ÄúNorthern California, specifically San Jose and San Francisco, continues to improve and at a pace that's slightly ahead of our original expectations,‚Äù Breslin said. ‚ÄúPerformance in San Jose picked up at the end of last year, but San Francisco really started to gain momentum at the beginning of this year.‚Äù As other REITs have noted, Los Angeles is more challenging. While the metro‚Äôs availability and occupancy are in line with last year's, according to Breslin, AVB‚Äôs year-to-date asking rent growth is below historical norms at just 3%. ‚ÄúWe'll need to see better job growth in LA, which has been weak recently, to experience stronger performance throughout the remainder of this year,‚Äù Breslin said. Unlike its established regions, supply continues to be a concern in AVB‚Äôs coastal markets. ‚ÄúWhile we are pleased with the portfolios we have curated in our expansion regions, we do expect these markets to continue to face operating softness until deliveries decline and market occupancies rebuild,‚Äù Schall said. ‚ÄúOn the flip side, this softness provides opportunities as we execute on our longer-term portfolio optimization goals, selectively increasing our allocation to our chosen expansion regions.‚Äù In Q1, AVB announced it acquired eight properties in Texas from entities associated with Little Rock, Arkansas-based owner BSR Real Estate Investment Trust. The deal closed last week. ‚ÄúThese are all relatively simple walk-up garden assets in suburban submarkets in our target geographies,‚Äù Matthew Birenbaum, AvalonBay‚Äôs chief investment officer, said on the earnings call. ‚ÄúAnd that doesn't happen all that often. So, mostly what we've done until this point has been buying kind of one-offs, and that's still kind of the base case assumption.‚Äù Like other trades, AVB sold assets from its established regions and redeployed that capital to the expansion regions in the Texas deals. SOURCE: AvalonBay ‚ÄúYou think about where rents in these markets have traveled over the last three years,‚Äù Breslin said. ‚ÄúYou look at the basis at which we can enter these markets and the Texas transaction being a good example of that at $230,000 a door, and we're thinking about long-term both earnings and value creation.‚Äù AVB will also continue to grow from developments with $3 billion of projects match funded and construction costs substantially locked in. ‚ÄúAs these projects lease up this year and next, they will produce a meaningful incremental stream of earnings that is unique to AvalonBay,‚Äù Schall said.

If you missed Nvidia‚Äôs (NVDA-1.54%) keynote at Computex 2025, here‚Äôs the short version: AI is no longer just a tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs the infrastructure of the future. Robots, desktops, smart cities, physics engines, and even national computing grids ‚Äî all of it, Nvidia says, will be built on artificial intelligence. Speaking in Taipei at Asia‚Äôs largest electronics expo, CEO Jensen Huang laid out a sweeping vision of the company‚Äôs future ‚Äî one where Nvidia isn‚Äôt just enabling AI, it‚Äôs helping build a world run by it. Leading the announcements was the DGX Spark, a compact AI supercomputer built for individual developers, researchers, and students. Think of it as a desktop-sized version of Nvidia‚Äôs massive Blackwell-based systems, with enough power to train and fine-tune large AI models locally ‚Äî no cloud access required. It‚Äôs the plug-and-play engine for what Huang called ‚ÄúAI-native‚Äù users ‚Äî those who want high-performance AI development at their fingertips. Major OEMs such as Dell (DELL-3.07%), ASUS, Lenovo, MSI, and Gigabyte are already lined up to offer Spark systems tailored for different segments of the market. That‚Äôs just one node in Nvidia‚Äôs broader push toward what Huang calls ‚ÄúAI factories‚Äù ‚Äî purpose-built computing environments where massive amounts of data are processed and AI-based systems are created, refined, and deployed. To support this expansive vision, Nvidia launched something Huang said was ‚Äúvery special‚Äù and ‚Äúone incredible ingredient‚Äù that has been missing: NVLink Fusion, an initiative that allows its GPUs to work seamlessly with third-party CPUs and custom AI chips. That means companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM+0.20%), Fujitsu, Marvell (MRVL-1.67%), and Alchip Technologies can plug into Nvidia‚Äôs ecosystem ‚Äî a notable shift for a company long known for its tightly integrated stacks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let all of our partners price it for themselves, but one thing‚Äôs for sure: Everybody can have one for Christmas,‚Äù Huang said. But this wasn‚Äôt just a cloud-computing conversation. It was one about bringing AI into the physical world. Nvidia doubled down on ‚Äúphysical AI‚Äù ‚Äî the idea that machines should understand and interact with the laws of the real world. Huang talked about Isaac Groot N1 (announced in March), which is a foundational model for robotics that gives humanoid robots the ability to reason, plan, and perceive their surroundings. ‚ÄúThe age of generalist robotics has arrived with breakthroughs in mechatronics, physical AI, and embedded computing ‚Äî just in time as labor shortages limit worldwide industrial growth,‚Äù Huang said. One challenge in robotics today is data scarcity, especially high-quality, physical interaction data. Nvidia hopes to answer this problem with Cosmos, a photorealistic simulator that creates synthetic data by observing human behavior in virtual environments. Isaac Groot N1, combined with Cosmos, means developers could now create massive amounts of training data in virtual worlds before rolling out systems in the real one. Developers can now use Groot Dreams ‚Äî a tool built on Cosmos ‚Äî to create ‚Äúfuture world states,‚Äù Huang said, by prompting the model with new tasks and images. This makes it possible to simulate millions of training scenarios before deploying robots in the real world. To help ground those dreams in physical reality, Nvidia will use the recently announced Newton, an open-source physics engine built in collaboration with Google DeepMind (GOOGL-1.57%) and Disney Research (DIS-1.33%) that will be open sourced in July. It‚Äôs designed to help AI systems understand real-world dynamics such as gravity, collisions, and torque ‚Äî bridging the gap between code and physical context. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible what it can do,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs completely GPU accelerated. It‚Äôs differentiable, so you could learn from experience. It is incredibly high fidelity.‚Äù Meanwhile, Nvidia is planting deeper roots in Asia with Nvidia Constellation, a new AI-focused hub in Taipei‚Äôs Beitou Shilin Science Park. It‚Äôs a strategic play ‚Äî tapping into Taiwan‚Äôs world-class semiconductor ecosystem while deepening Nvidia‚Äôs presence in the global AI supply chain. Taipei‚Äôs mayor, Chiang Wan-an, attended Huang‚Äôs keynote and later told reporters that the city fully supports Nvidia‚Äôs plans and is ready to offer whatever help is needed. One of the most strategically significant announcements came near the close of Huang‚Äôs keynote: a joint effort to build a national AI supercomputer in Taiwan. Nvidia will partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.63%) (TSMC), Foxconn, and the Taiwanese government to create a cutting-edge AI system for the island. This project aims to integrate AI deeply into urban infrastructure, transforming cities such as Taipei into smart ecosystems powered by advanced computing. The initiative underscores Nvidia‚Äôs goal of embedding AI ‚Äî and thus, its products ‚Äî into the fabric of daily life, from autonomous vehicles to intelligent public services. Huang‚Äôs overall message was unmistakable: AI is no longer just software. It‚Äôs infrastructure. It‚Äôs automation. It‚Äôs everywhere. And Nvidia wants to not only build just the silicon ‚Äî it wants to build but the systems, the software, and the global footprint to power it all. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: China's Xiaomi will spend $7 billion on homegrown chips amid the trade war

China‚Äôs Xiaomi will invest at least $6.9 billion over the next decade to develop its own semiconductor chips, the company announced Monday. CEO Lei Jun made the announcement in a post on the Chinese social media site Weibo. He said the tech giant is ‚Äúwell aware of the difficulty of chip manufacturing,‚Äù but it has ‚Äúformulated a long-term and continuous investment plan: at least ten years of investment, at least 50 billion yuan, steady and steady, step by step.‚Äù The first chip, the Xring 01, will be unveiled at a company event on May 22. Xiaomi previously started making its own chips beginning in 2014, unveiling them three years later, but the project was eventually scrapped due to a number of setbacks. The new chip initiative began in 2021, Lei wrote Monday. ‚ÄúXiaomi has always had a ‚Äòchip dream‚Äô because, in order to become a great hard-core technology company, chips are a peak that must be climbed and a tough battle that cannot be avoided,‚Äù he said. The company will manufacture integrated chips for use with its own smartphones. Apple (AAPL-0.39%) popularized the so-called system-on-a-chip (SoC) process, which combines essential functions on a single circuit to save space and power. Apple‚Äôs in-house chip designs have helped it remain dominant in the tech space. Xiaomi has relied on San Diego-based Qualcomm (QCOM+0.20%) and Taiwan‚Äôs MediaTek for chips, according to Business Insider. Qualcomm will reportedly continue to do so, yet stock was down about 1% Monday morning. The move makes Xiaomi the latest Chinese tech firm to focus on developing its own chips amid the U.S.-China trade war. In April, Huawei announced that it was getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%). In addition to the tariffs placed on China by President Trump last month, the U.S. has been restricting chipmakers from selling certain chip technologies to Chinese firms for years in an effort to curb the country‚Äôs advancements with AI chip technology. The approach has hurt business for U.S. chip makers such as Nvidia, which previously sold components to many Chinese firms.

May 19, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company‚Äôs senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance‚Äôs Medicaid members. What‚Äôs more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance‚Äôs rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now ‚Äúexpecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúseeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.‚Äù On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, ‚Äúdue to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.‚Äù On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Big Tech's great flattening is happening because it's out of options

Welcome back! In case you missed it, our new newsletter, Tech Memo, written by the great Alistair Barr, launched on Friday. Check out the first edition here. And if you aren't already, subscribe here. In today's big story, we're looking at Big Tech's obsession with cutting out middle managers and flattening their orgs. What's on deck Markets: When companies like Facebook and Zillow IPO, they turn to this man Tech: How one of the hottest coding startups almost died. Business: Gen Z is turning to blue-collar jobs. But first, no longer stuck in the middle. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Technology can quickly become outdated, but it's a job title in tech that's an endangered species: the middle manager. Big Tech is flattening its ranks to thin out layers of management in a bid to reduce bureaucracy, writes Emma Cosgrove, Tim Paradis, Eugene Kim, and Ashley Stewart. Middle managers have had to keep their heads on a swivel for a while. At the end of last year, BI's workplace expert Aki Ito detailed Corporate America falling out of love with the role. But the tech industry has taken the trend into overdrive, as is often the case. From Microsoft to Intel and Amazon, companies are shedding managers to make themselves as quick and lean as possible. The biggest immediate impact of flattening orgs is managers overseeing more workers. Some argue that will limit micromanagement. Others say you'll burn out the managers who are left behind. Big Tech is willing to take its chances, though. As Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last fall: "I hate bureaucracy." "The goal again is to allow us to have higher ownership and to move more quickly," Jassy added. Big Tech's middle-management purge speaks to a larger trend: Let the stars shine and get rid of anyone else. Part of tech companies' efficiency push is to identify top performers and weed out underachievers. With that approach, you could argue there is less of a need for managers. No weak links in the chain means managers don't have to do as much hand-holding. Get out of the way and let your top performers do what they do best. This isn't a foolproof strategy, though. Someone being extremely capable at their job doesn't always correlate with them being an easy employee to manage. In fact, sometimes the opposite can be true. But what other options do these tech giants have? The pressure from startups like OpenAI and Anthropic is undeniable. Their smaller size also gives them a massive leg up to move quickly. And when it comes to AI, speed is the name of the game. Meanwhile, middle managers seem to only be slowing companies down. 1. Trump's "Big, beautiful bill" could cause some big chaos. Market pros say the president's tax bill would add $4 trillion to the US deficit, stoking mayhem in the bond market. That means another Trump vs. bond market showdown could be headed our way. 2. Bankers tell startups wanting to go public: "Go, go, go." Startups like Hinge Health put their IPO plans on hold when Trump introduced sweeping tariffs. Now that the stock market has recovered, bankers are telling companies to go public while they still can. 3. This "hick from Ohio" is a big deal for IPOs. Pat Healy could be the forefather of getting stock exchanges to compete for the right to get a company to list with them. From free Davos advertising to NFL star appearances, here's how Healy lands companies major marketing perks. 1. "Appstinence" is a virtue. Raised in the age of the smartphone, a growing cohort of people, mostly millennials and Gen Zers, are opting for dumb tech instead. As the evidence of our collective phone addiction adds up, even tech lovers are embracing the digital detox movement. 2. How Silicon Valley's favorite startup came back from the edge of disaster. StackBlitz was at death's door when Anthropic released its AI model Sonnet 3.5 in 2024. That led StackBlitz to create Bolt.new, a product that could write code based on prompts written in English ‚Äî and the company's gold mine. BI's Alistair Barr has the full story. 3. Is AI coming for teachers? Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn thinks so. On a recent podcast appearance, he told venture capitalist Sarah Guo that schools will still be necessary in an AI-driven future ‚Äî but mostly just for childcare. He thinks AI will do the actual teaching. 1. Gen Z is dyeing white collars blue. The cost of college is skyrocketing, and the white-collar job market is unstable. That's led many young people to turn to trades instead, which can offer six-figure salaries and have a high demand for workers. 2. Selling a merger to Trump? MAGA-ify it. Cable giant Charter is merging with Cox, posing a bigger rival for Comcast. The merger still needs the green light from the Trump administration, and it seems like Charter is leaning into pro-American rhetoric to get it, BI's Peter Kafka writes. 3. LA investor Jessica Mah is in a legal battle with DGV investor Justin Caldbeck and two ex-employees. In a lawsuit, Mah has accused Caldbeck of sexually harassing her, which he denies. The lawsuits against Mah, meanwhile, accuse her of misusing company funds, harassment, and age discrimination, BI's Rob Price reports.

ByVivian Toh ByVivian Toh, Contributor. The U.S. and China strike a 90-day tariff agreement. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty ... More Images) Wall Street and Shanghai markets may have cheered the U.S.-China tariff d√©tente, but beneath the surface optimism lies a profound strategic recalibration of the world‚Äôs most consequential technological rivalry. The May 12 agreement, a 90-day suspension of escalating tariffs, has seen U.S. duties on Chinese imports plummet dramatically, from an aggressive 145% down to a more moderate 30%, while China reciprocated by reducing tariffs on American goods from 125% to 10%. This temporary peace, however, signals not an end to hostilities but a new phase defined by careful maneuvering and intense strategic rivalry, aptly termed "competitive coexistence." Influential Chinese commentator Ren Yi, widely known as Chairman Rabbit, encapsulated Beijing‚Äôs view by describing the tariff truce as a "beautiful counterattack." In a widely circulated WeChat post, Ren portrayed the agreement as a pragmatic victory against the Trump administration‚Äôs "impulsive paper-tiger tactics," underscoring China's long-term strategic acumen and disciplined approach in contrast to America's more reactive stance. His narrative resonated deeply with domestic Chinese audiences, reflecting Beijing‚Äôs confidence in its strategic positioning amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Yet, beyond political narratives, global financial markets have demonstrated notable resilience. After the initial tariff announcement on April 9 triggered widespread anxiety, markets had already begun to recalibrate expectations by the time the two nations officially announced the truce. From April 9 to May 12, technology stocks notably benefited from investor confidence in the resilience and adaptability of major firms. Alibaba led the charge with a remarkable 25.5% rise in its share price, followed closely by Tencent with a 17.3% increase and Baidu‚Äôs 13.3% gain. U.S. tech giants also shared in the relief rally: Meta‚Äôs shares surged by 9.2% and Apple‚Äôs by 6%, although Alphabet‚Äôs stock experienced a modest decline, reflecting lingering investor concerns about its international regulatory exposure and vulnerabilities in key global markets. Share price of U.S. and China tech giants before and after the tariff truce. This market adjustment represents more than mere optimism ‚Äî it highlights a deeper shift in investor psychology. Geopolitical tensions are no longer seen as isolated threats but strategic inflection points demanding corporate agility and adaptability. Investors increasingly expect firms to navigate geopolitical uncertainties effectively, turning potential disruptions into opportunities for strategic recalibration. Central to this recalibration is the intense race for artificial intelligence dominance. American companies like Meta and Microsoft are vigorously expanding AI capabilities through advanced cloud services, partnerships and product innovations. Meta's strong growth reflects increasing demand for its AI-powered ad tools and content creation services, which have significantly enhanced user targeting and engagement. Microsoft, meanwhile, continues to integrate OpenAI‚Äôs cutting-edge technologies into its Azure cloud platform, seeking to set global standards in enterprise AI solutions. Chinese tech giants are equally aggressive, accelerating development of self-contained AI ecosystems in response to tightening U.S. restrictions, including export controls on advanced AI chips and critical technologies. Tencent, for instance, reported robust financial results in Q1 2025, with revenues climbing 13% year-on-year to RMB 180 billion ($25.1 billion). This growth was fueled primarily by its Value-Added Services segment, including blockbuster games such as Honour of Kings and Delta Force, as well as AI-driven marketing enhancements on platforms like Weixin Search. Despite substantial investments in AI, Tencent managed an 18% rise in operating profits to RMB 69.3 billion ($9.7 billion), underlining its capacity to balance strategic investments with profitability. Meanwhile, China‚Äôs strategic pivot toward domestic technological innovation has been particularly evident in AI infrastructure development. Initiatives like Baidu‚Äôs PaddlePaddle and Alibaba‚Äôs ModelScope illustrate a determined push to build sovereign technological stacks capable of competing independently of foreign technologies. The broader geopolitical context, especially U.S. export controls and the rescinding of the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule ‚Äî replaced with targeted restrictions ‚Äî has galvanized China‚Äôs resolve to innovate autonomously. The strategic realignment also underscores broader shifts in global supply chains, with U.S. companies actively diversifying manufacturing and production away from China to hedge against future geopolitical shocks. Apple epitomizes this approach through its accelerated expansion in alternative manufacturing hubs like India and Vietnam ‚Äî a strategy known as ‚ÄúChina+1.‚Äù However, despite these tactical shifts, China‚Äôs entrenched role in global manufacturing, bolstered by its extensive supplier networks, skilled workforce and manufacturing efficiencies, renders complete decoupling unrealistic and economically disruptive. Capital and talent flows have similarly been reshaped by geopolitical tensions. Chinese firms now face increasing obstacles when attempting to access foreign investment or public markets. Heightened scrutiny of researchers‚Äô visas and the politicization of academic collaborations have further complicated talent acquisition. Nevertheless, both China and the U.S. continue to significantly ramp up domestic investments. The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act channels substantial federal funds into semiconductor and AI research, aiming to safeguard technological leadership. China mirrors these efforts with extensive initiatives bolstering technology zones, intensifying public-private partnerships and prioritizing STEM education nationwide. The resulting environment is one of strategic caution combined with sustained competitive aggression ‚Äî a delicate equilibrium captured by the term "competitive coexistence." Companies must adeptly navigate a dual reality of collaboration and competition, reflecting a fragmented yet interconnected global technology landscape. In this new paradigm, the defining contest between the U.S. and China transcends tariff skirmishes. Instead, the battlefield extends to innovation, scalability and influence over international technological standards. This truce thus provides not only temporary economic relief but also a moment of clarity, spotlighting the relentless drive of both superpowers toward long-term technological supremacy. The markets, now more accustomed to such dynamics, perceive geopolitical frictions as persistent realities that demand continuous strategic foresight and adaptability.

Title: Why META Stock Is A Prime Choice In The AI Boom

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/18: In this photo illustration, the Meta AI logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: Why pay a premium of 35 times earnings for Microsoft stock when Meta stock is available at 25 times earnings? This seems particularly questionable when considering the following three key factors: Meta isn't exactly a safe haven investment. To illustrate this, consider how Meta's stock has reacted during past market shocks: it experienced a significant 77% decline during the 2022 inflation shock, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of only 25% for the S&P 500. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Meta‚Äôs stock fell by 35%, while the S&P 500 saw a comparable decline of 34%. These instances suggest that Meta is not a particularly "safe" stock. Also, see Buy or Sell Meta Stock. Furthermore, it has already seen substantial gains this year, rising 7%, and a remarkable 32% in just one month, climbing from around $485 on April 21st to $640 currently. On the other hand, for a more balanced perspective, consider the Trefis High Quality strategy, which has outperformed the market with over 91% returns since its inception, as demonstrated in the HQ performance metrics. Confident in the long-term potential of the AI revolution? Meta Platforms presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its unique position. Unlike companies solely focused on AI development, Meta integrates AI across its massive and growing user base. The daily active people (DAP) across Meta's family of apps have grown by an impressive 16%, from 2.95 billion in 2022 to 3.43 billion currently. This vast engagement provides a distinct advantage in monetizing AI advancements through enhanced advertising, content recommendations, and overall user experience. A substantial portion of the company's revenue is directly generated from ad sales on its key platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, making AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and delivery particularly impactful. Supported by significant investments in AI research and development, and leveraging this unparalleled global social media network, Meta is strategically positioned to capitalize on AI growth, regardless of the dominant technologies that emerge. Despite its compelling advantages, investing in Meta is not without risks. A key concern is the potential for earnings to fall short of expectations or for sales growth to decelerate from 22% in the past year to a possible 15% in the near future. This slowdown could be driven by broader economic headwinds, where businesses might reduce advertising expenditures to preserve capital, particularly in the event of slowing economic growth or a recession. Furthermore, unforeseen or unexpected shocks could negatively impact the stock‚Äôs performance. Consequently, investors should be prepared for the possibility of significant declines, potentially reaching 50% or more. Selling during such downturns could be detrimental to long-term returns. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider consulting a financial advisor with experience navigating multiple bear markets. They can provide insights into strategies like the Trefis HQ strategy and other prudent approaches to potentially capitalize on market downturns. Remember, substantial wealth can be generated in such environments by maintaining a rational perspective. Considering these factors, if you are a long-term investor with a 3-to-5-year horizon and a buy-and-hold strategy, Meta could present an interesting entry point at its current valuation, even after its recent price increase.

Speaking at the Computex trade show, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that Nvidia will work with Taiwan‚Äôs government and Foxconn‚Äôs Big Innovation Group to construct the new system, which will house over 10,000 of Nvidia‚Äôs next-generation Blackwell GPUs. The supercomputer will be deployed at the National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC) and support Taiwan‚Äôs leading academic institutions and Nvidia‚Äôs key chip partner, TSMC, as per a company statement on Monday. ‚ÄúWe are growing beyond the limits of our current office [in Taiwan],‚Äù Huang said, debuting concept footage of the company‚Äôs upcoming ‚ÄúConstellation‚Äù HQ, designed to resemble a spacecraft landed in Taipei‚Äôs Beitou district. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes tech firms to onshore manufacturing, rolling back Biden-era export restrictions while cracking down on AI chip sales to China. Nvidia has pledged to invest $500 billion in U.S. infrastructure, but Monday‚Äôs announcements show the company‚Äôs deep dependence on Taiwan‚Äôs supply chain and scientific institutions. According to Nvidia, the new system will deliver more than eight times the AI performance of the existing Taiwania 2. It will feature HGX H200 nodes, Blackwell Ultra-based B300 systems, and GB200 NVL72 racks, all connected via Nvidia‚Äôs Quantum InfiniBand networking. ‚ÄúThe new NCHC supercomputer will drive breakthroughs in sovereign AI, quantum computing, and advanced scientific computation,‚Äù said NCHC Director General Chau-Lyan Chang. Among the projects it will power TAIDE, a national effort to build large language models tuned to Taiwanese culture and language; a generative AI development platform called Taiwan AI RAP; and simulations in climate modeling, quantum chemistry, and epidemic prevention. Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA-Q platform has already enabled researchers to run a record-breaking 784-qubit quantum simulation, according to the statement. A new hybrid quantum-classical computing system is also in development. The Taiwan rollout follows Huang‚Äôs recent trip through the Gulf with President Trump, where Saudi Arabia committed to a $600 billion investment package spanning AI, energy, and infrastructure. As part of that initiative, Nvidia agreed to supply at least 18,000 Blackwell GPUs to power ‚ÄúHumain,‚Äù a state-backed Saudi AI firm developing a 500-megawatt data center. The company also unveiled NVLink Fusion, a new effort to let rival AI chips connect directly to Nvidia‚Äôs platform, aimed at locking its GPUs into the backbone of next-gen AI systems. ‚ÄúNothing gives me more joy than when you buy everything from Nvidia ... but it gives me tremendous joy if you just buy something from Nvidia,‚Äù he said. Nvidia (NVDA) is currently trading at $135.40, up 0.42% on the day, per Google Finance data.

Title: Hired-Hand Billionaires 2025: These 48 Executives Got Rich Working For Others
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2025/05/19/hired-hand-billionaires-2025-these-48-executives-got-rich-working-for-others/

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. Most billionaires got rich by building businesses or inheriting big bucks from someone who did. Yet a small but growing group of current and former American executives have managed to amass three-comma fortunes as very well-paid employees. Altogether, Forbes found a record 48 of these hired-hand billionaires in 2025, up from 29 a year ago. And that count is sure to keep climbing thanks to soaring share prices and sky-high executive pay packages. The average annual compensation of the ten highest-paid CEOs in America shot up more than sevenfold from $46 million per year in 2010 to a peak of $330 million per year in 2021, according to data firm Equilar. Most Americans build their wealth through a salary or hourly wage, but top execs are often paid in stock options and other share awards that vest over several years and are often tied to performance. And that‚Äôs increasingly the case, with the average equity component of CEO pay packages growing from 54% in 2012 to 66% in 2023, per executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy. That‚Äôs helped the best-paid CEOs in the U.S. keep getting richer, even as the average pay of the top ten chief executives has actually fallen post-Covid, to a still-enviable $125 million per year in 2023, the most recent year for which full data is available. Because the stock market has continued to climb, with the S&P 500 up nearly 370% since 2010 and nearly 25% since 2021, the value of the shares many of these executives were awarded in the past has skyrocketed, helping the rich get richer and making more companies big enough to birth non-founder billionaires than ever before. Back in 2010, only seven of America‚Äôs 403 billionaires were hired-hands, accounting for just 2% of the country‚Äôs richest people. That included six former executives who are also on this year‚Äôs list: Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and Eric Schmidt of Google, the two richest hired-hands by far today, as well as Jeff Skoll and Meg Whitman of eBay, John Brown of medical equipment maker Stryker and Hamilton ‚ÄúTony‚Äù James of Blackstone. (The seventh, former Cisco CEO John Morgridge, has since fallen from the billionaire ranks.) Fifteen years later, hired-hand billionaires are still relatively rare, but their numbers have increased at a rate that outpaces the incredible growth of America‚Äôs three-comma club overall, suggesting that the ten-figure fortunes minted by these current and former non-founder executives aren‚Äôt just the result of a rising tide lifting all boats. Today, 5% of America‚Äôs nearly 900 billionaires are hired-hands, up from 4% when Forbes last counted them in February 2024, when there were nearly 760 U.S. billionaires. There are 18 newcomers in this year‚Äôs group, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, FICO CEO William Lansing, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell, former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel, longtime Nvidia director Harvey Jones and Howard Lutnick, who left his role as chairman and CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald to become President Trump‚Äôs secretary of commerce in February. AMD CEO Lisa Su is the only hired-hand on last year‚Äôs list who failed to make the cut this year, as shares of the chipmaker she runs have cratered by nearly 30% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, early Uber employee Ryan Graves and Bob Muglia, the former CEO of cloud-based database software firm Snowflake, have regained their billionaire status and returned to this year‚Äôs ranking after failing to make the 2024 list of hired-hands. Here are a few of the most notable newcomers on this year‚Äôs hired-hands list (net worths are as of May 13, 2025): Born and raised in Russia, Shikin joined marketing software and mobile game maker AppLovin as vice president of engineering when the company was founded in 2012. He was promoted to chief technology officer in 2020 and helped take the company public a year later. Shikin owes a big chunk of his fortune to a performance-based share award he was granted in 2023 that could only be fully unlocked if AppLovin‚Äôs stock price soared sixfold in five years. The company hit that once unfathomable goal by the third quarter of 2024, and the company‚Äôs market capitalization has skyrocketed by another 370% since to $125 billion, amid a frenzy for anything remotely AI-adjacent. Shikin owns a nearly 1% stake in AppLovin between his stock and options that is worth $1.6 billion. He is one of eight AppLovin billionaires, including fellow hired-hand Herald Chen. Winkelried joined Goldman Sachs in 1982 and rose to president and co-chief operating officer in 2006, alongside President Trump‚Äôs future chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn. When Winkelried retired three years later, he walked away with 1.5 million Goldman shares that would be worth nearly $900 million today with the bank‚Äôs shares soaring nearly sixfold since the end of March 2009, plus options to acquire another 1.1 million shares (though Forbes assumes that Winkelried likely diversified his holdings along the way, and a spokesperson declined to comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2015 to become co-CEO of TPG alongside the private equity giant‚Äôs billionaire cofounder Jim Coulter. Winkelried was promoted to sole CEO in 2021, when Coulter stepped back into his current role as executive chair, and the pair helped take TPG public in 2022 with the firm‚Äôs other billionaire cofounder David Bonderman (d. December 2024). TPG‚Äôs stock has soared by more than 50% since the IPO, and the 5% stake Winkelried has earned so far for his 10 years of service to the firm is now worth more than $950 million. Culp joined Danaher, the industrial conglomerate founded by billionaire brothers Mitchell and Steven Rales, in 1990 and rose to president and CEO in 2001. By the time he retired 14 years later, Culp had helped boost the company‚Äôs stock price by more than 500% and netted nearly $230 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting stock along the way. That left him with 1.7 million split-adjusted shares that would be worth nearly $350 million today with Danaher‚Äôs stock up more than 200% since, plus options to acquire another 2.9 million split-adjusted shares (though Forbes assumes that Culp likely diversified his holdings along the way, and his spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2018 to lead the turnaround of troubled General Electric as chairman and CEO. He has broken up the bloated conglomerate into three separate public companies after spinning off its healthcare business as GE HealthCare in 2023 and its energy business as GE Vernova in 2024. Shares of the original company, now known as GE Aerospace, have nearly quadrupled since Culp took over as CEO, earning him shares of all three companies that are worth more than $400 million combined. After nearly a decade at Google, Arora left for Japanese investment giant Softbank in 2014, where he was promoted to president and chief operating officer a year later and touted as the likely successor to the firm‚Äôs billionaire founder Masayoshi Son. Things didn‚Äôt go as planned, and Arora resigned from his executive roles in 2016, though he remained at the company as an advisor for another year. He ended up cashing out at least $360 million (before tax) during his short stint at Softbank between his lucrative pay package and resignation agreement. He spent a year angel investing, then joined cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks as chairman and CEO in 2018. The firm, which was founded by an Israeli-American entrepreneur named Nir Zuk, who now serves as chief technology officer, in 2005 has seen its stock price soar nearly sixfold since Arora took over, making both him and Zuk billionaires. Arora has netted nearly $800 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting shares over the past two and a half years, leaving him with stock and options worth another $340 million. Brown is the longest-serving CEO of Motorola after the firm‚Äôs cofounder Paul Galvin (d. 1959) and his son Bob Galvin (d. 2011). Brown joined Motorola in 2003 and was promoted to chief executive in 2008. He spun off the company‚Äôs struggling legacy smartphone business as a separate public company called Motorola Mobility in 2011, and the Razr maker was acquired by Google for $12.5 billion a year later. (It‚Äôs now part of Lenovo.) Then, through a series of more than 50 acquisitions, Brown has transformed the company now known as Motorola Solutions into a nearly $70 billion (market capitalization) behemoth in the market for mission-critical public safety communications, 911 command center solutions and video security. The firm‚Äôs stock has soared more than sixfold since Brown took over, and he‚Äôs netted more than $700 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling shares along the way. He still owns Motorola Solutions stock and options worth a further $600 million. Baratta and Chae are two of five hired-hand billionaires from Blackstone, the nearly $180 billion (market capitalization) alternative asset management giant cofounded by billionaires Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson (d. 2018). Baratta joined Blackstone in 1998 and moved to London in 2001 to help build the firm‚Äôs European private equity business. He has served as global head of private equity since 2012. Chae joined Blackstone in 1997 and ran its international private equity business before being promoted to chief financial officer in 2015 and vice chairman in January. Blackstone‚Äôs stock is up nearly 15% over the past year, and Baratta and Chae each own shares worth nearly $1 billion. With Microsoft stock at an all-time high, the software giant‚Äôs chairman and CEO is a billionaire for the first time. Nadella joined the tech giant in 1992 and rose to CEO in 2014, when America‚Äôs richest hired-hand billionaire, Steve Ballmer, retired that year. Nadella was named chairman in 2021, replacing veteran tech exec and investor John Thompson, who had assumed the role from Microsoft‚Äôs billionaire cofounder Bill Gates in 2014. Nadella has made Microsoft a major player in the AI boom, investing more than $10 billion in OpenAI since 2019 and leading the development of Microsoft‚Äôs own suite of AI-powered tools called CoPilot. He owns just 0.01% of the $3.4 trillion (market capitalization) company‚Äôs stock, but that‚Äôs just enough to make him a billionaire‚Äîwhen combined with his more than $600 million in (pretax) share sales.

May 19, 2025 05:20 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that the Elevance Health class action lawsuit ‚Äì captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., No. 25-cv-00923 (S.D. Ind.) ‚Äì seeks to represent purchasers of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) common stock and charges Elevance Health as well as certain of Elevance Health‚Äôs executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-elevance-health-inc-class-action-lawsuit-elv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Elevance Health class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than July 11, 2025. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Elevance Health operates as a health benefits company. Among other things, the cost of providing health benefits to members is driven by the level of care a patient requires, often referred to as ‚Äúacuity,‚Äù and the members‚Äô utilization of the health benefits, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the class period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Medicaid redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance Health‚Äôs Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs; and (ii) this shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance Health‚Äôs rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 17, 2024, Elevance Health revealed that it was now ‚Äúexpecting second half utilization to increase in Medicaid‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúseeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment as well as some elective procedures.‚Äù On this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 6%, according to the complaint. Then, on October 17, 2024, the Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that Elevance Health announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that Elevance Health had missed consensus earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, ‚Äúdue to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.‚Äù Elevance Health further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that on this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 11%. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Elevance Health common stock during the class period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. An investor‚Äôs ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit.

A rally across all market indices, as China-focused tariffs were reduced, helped lift the CE 100 Index 5% higher in a week that saw almost all pillars advance, with the exception of the ‚ÄúBe Well‚Äù segment. In the Shop vertical, up 7%, Shopify surged 20.3% to take the lead among gainers for the week. Shopify‚Äôs first-quarter earnings results showed double-digit growth in gross merchandise volumes (GMV) and a continued movement toward streamlined checkout online and further inroads made in offline commerce. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still early to assess the full impact of the current trade environment,‚Äù Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said on the conference call with analysts. He added that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre, of course, monitoring for potential slowdowns, but our data through April shows little evidence of that.‚Äù The company‚Äôs earnings results noted that revenues were up 27% to $2.4 billion; GMV surged 22% to $74.8 billion. Offline GMV increased 23% and B2B GMV delivered triple-digit growth, up 109% from the year-ago first quarter, Finkelstein said. Tencent took the Pay and Be Paid segment up 6.9%. In its own quarterly report, Tencent‚Äôs CEO noted that its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities had ‚Äúcontributed tangibly‚Äù to its gaming and advertising businesses. Revenue was up 13% year over year to 180 billion yuan ($25 billion). ‚ÄúWe also stepped up our spending on new AI opportunities, such as the Yuanbao application and AI in Weixin,‚Äù CEO Ma Huateng said, referring to the company‚Äôs super app. Domestic Games revenues were 42.9 billion yuan, representing a 24% year-over-year increase from last year. Tencent shares were 18% higher. Also within the payments sphere, Affirm‚Äôs stock gained 13.2%. Affirm is partnering with Costco to offer online shoppers the option to pay over time for transactions. Customers, if approved, will be able to select monthly Affirm payment plans when shopping on Costco‚Äôs website. Also within the payments pantheon, PayPal‚Äôs stock was up 2.7%. The company‚Äôs shares rose in the wake of news that AI search company Perplexity has launched a partnership with PayPal. The collaboration will see Perplexity use PayPal to power agentic commerce on its Perplexity Pro platform. Beginning this summer, U.S. consumers can check out instantly using PayPal or Venmo when they ask Perplexity to look for products, book travel or purchase tickets, per the announcement. As for the payment networks themselves, Visa and Mastercard gained a respective 3.6% and 2.6%. As detailed by PYMNTS, a group of trade associations representing European retailers reportedly asked the European Commission to take action against Mastercard and Visa under European Union antitrust rules, alleging that the companies charge high fees and don‚Äôt provide transparency on those fees. In a letter, the associations also called for price controls on interchange fees, transparency and nondiscriminatory obligations for International Card Schemes, and a tool for regulators to scrutinize ICSs‚Äô actions.

Title: Legendary investor Ron Baron shares the early contrarian lesson that's helped him return 1,843% over 22 years
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ron-baron-shares-the-first-investing-lesson-he-ever-learned-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-19T08:00:02Z
Full Content:
It's hard to imagine Ron Baron, the billionaire founder of Baron Capital, knowing little about investing. Baron is one of the most successful investors of his time, amassing more than $41 billion in assets under management since 1982. His Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) is up 1,843% since launching in May 2003, trouncing the S&P 500's 536% return and beating 99% of similar funds over the last 5-, 10-, and 15-year periods, according to Morningstar data. But like all of us, he was once a beginner, too. After studying chemistry and then attending law school, Baron finally decided he wanted to work in finance. With no job offer, he moved into a friend's basement in New Jersey until he could find work. His engineer parents weren't happy. But his uncle bought him a copy of Joseph E. Granville's "A Strategy Of Daily Stock Market Timing For Maximum Profit." Reading it, Baron learned his first major lesson about investing: taking a contrarian approach to prevailing market consensus can pay off. "What made sense in this book, which was not intuitive, was that when news was really bad, you're supposed to invest, you're supposed to buy things," Baron told the Economic Club of New York on May 13. "And when news was really good, you're supposed to sell things." Essentially, don't chase returns on the back end of rallies when all the good news is already priced in. It's time-tested advice that many investing legends espouse. Warren Buffett's famous mantra was to "be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful." Sir John Templeton wrote: "Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell." Investor sentiment has been all over the place in recent weeks. After President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement, investors became exceptionally bearish on stocks. A month ago, CNN's Fear and Greed Index was in "Extreme Fear" territory. But the outlook has improved as Trump has started to back off from his trade war. Right now, "Greed" is the dominant feeling among investors. Today, Baron is uber-bullish on Tesla, saying he believes its share price will grow 10x from current levels. The stock makes up 35% of his Baron Partners Fund. While Baron doesn't trade short-term macro developments, instead betting on companies he thinks will outperform over the long term, he still applies the lesson he learned early in his career by being ahead of the consensus on the stocks he buys and seeing future outcomes that no one else sees. "It's about being the opposite of what everyone else says," he said. And when things are going awry in markets and the economy, Baron stays cool and thinks about the big picture. "I just figure like John Lennon that in the long run, everything's going to work out. And if it doesn't work out, it's not the end yet," he said. "Sooner or later, everything works out. Man causes problems and then fixes the problems." Where Big Tech secrets go public ‚Äî unfiltered in your inbox weekly. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down.

With four additional iQPS missions planned for 2025 and two more in 2026, Rocket Lab is set to play a crucial role in expanding iQPS' satellite constellation. The next mission under this contract is scheduled to launch as early as June 2025, further demonstrating Rocket Lab's commitment to frequent, reliable, and precise orbital deployments. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, stated, "Another fantastic launch by the Electron team to flawlessly deliver another iQPS mission to orbit. Constellation deployment requires a reliable rocket with pinpoint orbital deployment accuracy that allows for the seamless integration of the latest spacecraft to the constellation - and that's exactly the service Electron continues to provide as the global leading launcher for small satellite missions. With another mission lined up with iQPS in just a few short weeks, we're looking forward to supporting their constellation with multiple missions this year and next." iQPS CEO, Dr. Shunsuke Onishi, commented, "We are truly delighted to have successfully launched our 10th satellite, 'WADATSUMI-I,' into orbit just two months after the launch of our QPS-SAR-9 'SUSANOO-I.'

Title: Baxter & Bailey bring The Design Laundry to Barcelona

With humour, honesty and a few disaster stories, Baxter & Bailey's OFFF talk celebrated the messy side of creativity and why embracing mistakes might be the best design tool of all. With humour, honesty and a few disaster stories, Baxter & Bailey's OFFF talk celebrated the messy side of creativity and why embracing mistakes might be the best design tool of all. Baxter & Bailey could've taken the safe route for their Friday evening talk at OFFF. They could've showcased slick work for the Royal Parks, the Royal Mail, or the London Soundtrack Festival. Instead, they pulled back the curtain on what really goes on behind the pristine curtain of the design industry, revealing a tangle of mistakes, mishaps and moments of pure chaos. "We live in a world where everything we see is finished, polished and presented, which can be quite a daunting prospect for young designers entering the industry," they explained. "It's a nice reminder that even the most experienced designers mess up sometimes." With that, Matt and Dom launched into an hour of confession, comedy, and collective therapy. It was an airing of creative dirty laundry, shared in the spirit of learning and laughter. Baxter & Bailey started with their own biggest fumbles, warming the crowd up for what was to come. Dom kicked things off with a tale from a night train journey in Russia en route to a crucial pitch for a telecoms giant. Sharing a cabin with a snoring stranger called Constantin from Moscow, he awoke to find his roommate enjoying breakfast in nothing but his pants. In the panic to flee, Dom left his carefully crafted presentation boards on the train. "What I learnt from that mistake was: even if you wake up and the first thing you see is an old Russian man's crotch, keep cool, don't panic and remember what you're doing," Dom told the crowd. Matt followed with a story from a concept presentation a decade ago. Just a few minutes in, the client's top boss entered the boardroom, watched in silence‚Ä¶ then stood up, gave a thumbs down, and stuck out his tongue with a rude noise of disapproval. "I still cringe every time I hear that story," said Dom. The pair soon revealed they weren't alone in their confessions. Before the talk, they'd floated the idea to British design legend Rian Hughes, who not only approved but offered his own disaster story. On screen, Rian recalled his first job interview at a Camden agency. Lost, rain-soaked, and 45 minutes late, he finally arrived with his portfolio strapped to a trolley. As he lifted it onto the table, he noticed something brown on his sleeve and realised he'd rolled the trolley through dog poo. One side of his portfolio was covered, and so was the director's mahogany table (not to mention the stench). "Despite this auspicious beginning, I got the job," said Rian. "But I don't recommend it as an interview technique ‚Äì and the job was shit anyway. I lasted three months." With proof of concept secured, Baxter & Bailey launched The Design Laundry, a growing archive of creative calamities submitted by designers across the industry. The idea is that people share their worst moments, get them out in the open, and maybe learn something in the process. Here are just a few they aired at OFFF. Jamie Ellul, founder of Supple Studio, joined in from the remote countryside to share his cautionary tale. Early in his solo career, he landed a job designing a brochure for an accountancy firm. "I think it might have actually looked worse than it did in the beginning when I was finished," Jamie admitted. He sent the final artwork to print, then forwarded the printer's quote to the client before hopping on a train. Following weeks of radio silence, the client finally replied: 'Hi Jamie, I've been wondering how to respond to your email, having seen your note to the printer below on the email chain'. That note read: 'Please don't judge me‚Äîthis is the shittest thing I've ever designed'. Cue laughter from the crowd ‚Äì and a lesson in double-checking email chains. As Matt and Dom pointed out, email fails were the most common type of submission. We've all been there. Next up: Francis Jackson, formerly of MetaDesign and OPX and now a psychotherapist, shared her story in a letter. Years ago, she worked with The King's Trust on a beautifully designed book promoting the value of art in the built environment, Art in the Public Environment. The problem was that a glaring typo was revealed by none other than the King of England himself after hundreds of printed copies went out across the country. What the front cover actually said was: 'Art in the Pubic Realm'. When the King was handed a copy while visiting the offices, he swiftly returned it, eyebrows raised. I'm sure Francis was hoping for the ground to open up beneath her at that moment! Daljit Singh, co-founder of pioneering digital agency Digit, appeared onscreen in sunglasses, mid-holiday, to recount a transatlantic disaster. After landing in the UK from New York in 2007, Daljit got a message: Gene Simmons (yes, from KISS) wanted to meet him. Being a huge fan, he turned around, caught the next flight back, and headed straight to the hotel. But as he flew, doubt crept in, and he asked himself: could it be a prank? He'd played an elaborate hoax on his friend Simon not too long ago, so when told to ask for "Simon Smith" at reception (apparently Gene's alias), his suspicions grew. Still, he went upstairs, knocked on the door, and shouted, "Simon, come out, you massive tosser." None other than Gene Simmons opened the door. "You English guys have got such strange senses of humour," he said, before ushering Daljit in. The meeting lasted three awkward minutes. They didn't get the job. After airing these disasters, Matt and Dom returned to each story to highlight the learning points. Jamie reminded us to treat every job (and every email) with care. Francis' typo showed that even major mistakes fade with time. Daljit's story offered a reminder not to let doubt derail bold decisions. The laundry pile grew with more stories, laughs, and stains, and the pair could've gone all night. Luckily, this won't be the last spin cycle for The Design Laundry. Dom and Matt are bringing the idea to future events and inviting more submissions through their website. Because if creativity is a messy process, there's no shame in airing a little dirty laundry.

May 19, 2025 00:25 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA TAIPEI, Taiwan, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- COMPUTEX -- NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.5, the first update to NVIDIA‚Äôs open, generalized, fully customizable foundation model for humanoid reasoning and skills; NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams, a blueprint for generating synthetic motion data; and NVIDIA Blackwell systems to accelerate humanoid robot development. Humanoid and robotics developers Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Fourier, Foxlink, Galbot, Mentee Robotics, NEURA Robotics, General Robotics, Skild AI and XPENG Robotics are adopting NVIDIA Isaac‚Ñ¢ platform technologies to advance humanoid robot development and deployment. ‚ÄúPhysical AI and robotics will bring about the next industrial revolution,‚Äù said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. ‚ÄúFrom AI brains for robots to simulated worlds to practice in or AI supercomputers for training foundation models, NVIDIA provides building blocks for every stage of the robotics development journey.‚Äù New Isaac GR00T Data Generation Blueprint Closes the Data Gap Showcased in Huang‚Äôs COMPUTEX keynote address, NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams is a blueprint that helps generate vast amounts of synthetic motion data ‚Äî aka neural trajectories ‚Äî that physical AI developers can use to teach robots new behaviors, including how to adapt to changing environments. Developers can first post-train Cosmos Predict world foundation models (WFMs) for their robot. Then, using a single image as the input, GR00T-Dreams generates videos of the robot performing new tasks in new environments. The blueprint then extracts action tokens ‚Äî compressed, digestible pieces of data ‚Äî that are used to teach robots how to perform these new tasks. The GR00T-Dreams blueprint complements the Isaac GR00T-Mimic blueprint, which was released at the NVIDIA GTC conference in March. While GR00T-Mimic uses the NVIDIA Omniverse‚Ñ¢ and NVIDIA Cosmos‚Ñ¢ platforms to augment existing data, GR00T-Dreams uses Cosmos to generate entirely new data. New Isaac GR00T Models Advance Humanoid Robot Development NVIDIA Research used the GR00T-Dreams blueprint to generate synthetic training data to develop GR00T N1.5 ‚Äî an update to GR00T N1 ‚Äî in just 36 hours, compared with what would have taken nearly three months of manual human data collection. GR00T N1.5 can better adapt to new environments and workspace configurations, as well as recognize objects through user instructions. This update significantly improves the model‚Äôs success rate for common material handling and manufacturing tasks like sorting or putting away objects. Early adopters of GR00T N models include AeiRobot, Foxlink, Lightwheel and NEURA Robotics. AeiRobot employs the models to enable ALICE4 to understand natural language instructions and execute complex pick-and-place workflows in industrial settings. Foxlink Group is using them to improve industrial robot manipulator flexibility and efficiency, while Lightwheel is harnessing them to validate synthetic data for faster humanoid robot deployment in factories. NEURA Robotics is evaluating the models to accelerate its development of household automation systems. New Robot Simulation and Data Generation Frameworks Accelerate Training Pipelines Developing highly skilled humanoid robots requires a massive amount of diverse data, which is costly to capture and process. Robots need to be tested in the physical world, which can present costs and risk. To help close the data and testing gap, NVIDIA unveiled the following simulation technologies: Foxconn and Foxlink are using the GR00T-Mimic blueprint for synthetic motion manipulation generation to accelerate their robotics training pipelines. Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Fourier, Mentee Robotics, NEURA Robotics and XPENG Robotics are simulating and training their humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab. Skild AI is using the simulation frameworks to develop general robot intelligence, and General Robotics is integrating them into its robot intelligence platform. Universal Blackwell Systems for Robot Developers Global systems manufacturers are building NVIDIA RTX PRO‚Ñ¢ 6000 workstations and servers, offering a single architecture to easily run every robot development workload across training, synthetic data generation, robot learning and simulation. Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro announced NVIDIA RTX PRO-powered servers, and Dell Technologies, HPI and Lenovo announced NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell-powered workstations. When more compute is required to run large-scale training or data generation workloads, developers can tap into NVIDIA Blackwell systems like GB200 NVL72 ‚Äî available with NVIDIA DGX‚Ñ¢ Cloud on leading cloud providers and NVIDIA Cloud Partners ‚Äî to achieve up to 18x greater performance for data processing. Developers can deploy their robot foundation models to the NVIDIA Jetson Thor platform, coming soon ‚Äî enabling accelerated on-robot inference and runtime performance.

By Pete Hammond Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic Like Jacques Tati, Woody Allen and Luis Bu√±uel, there can be no mistaking a movie directed and written by Wes Anderson. An auteur in the truest sense of the word, he is as much a painter with words and visuals that put us unquestionably into part of a brain that sees the world the way he wants to see it. There‚Äôs his Oscar-winning masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel; animated gems Isle of Dogs and my favorite Wes movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox; and a string of beloved film comedies including The Royal Tannenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, Moonrise Kingdom and so many more including his 2024 Oscar-winning short The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. It is good to report that the filmmaker is back in style with his latest, The Phoenician Scheme, after stumbling a bit through the overly narrated and artificial (even for Anderson) Asteroid City, the most recent of his films to debut in Cannes, just as his latest world builder, The Phoenician Scheme, did Sunday night in Competition. This one is particularly refreshing in that, instead of focusing on a number of characters, here it is Benicio Del Toro‚Äòs Zsa-Zsa Korda, a shady, uber-wealthy industrialist who dominates the proceedings much the way we saw in other Anderson riffs like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Sure, there are the usual starry cameos running through the story, but it is all in the service of Zsa-zsa, a man who dominated the business world and global economy in Europe in the early 1950s in much the same way we see Elon Musk now, an equally shady rich guy whose track record is spotty at best. In fact, there also are sly comparisons we could make even to Donald Trump with this man, whose enemies are doing everything to bring down his empire where he is accused of swindling banks, skipping tariffs, filing frivolous lawsuits ‚Äî you name it, he‚Äôs done it.

May 18, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, May 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (‚ÄúElevance‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (NYSE: ELV). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Elevance and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 11, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (‚ÄúCEO‚Äù) Gail Boudreaux revealed that ‚Äú[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,‚Äù and Chief Financial Officer (‚ÄúCFO‚Äù) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now ‚Äúexpecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.‚Äù Kaye elaborated that the Company was ‚Äúseeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.‚Äù On this news, Elevance‚Äôs stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company‚Äôs ‚Äúthird quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.‚Äù Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) from $37.20 to ‚Äúapproximately $33‚Äù‚Äîdespite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that ‚Äúwe experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter‚Äù and ‚Äúsaw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.‚Äù On this news, Elevance‚Äôs stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, May 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (‚ÄúElevance‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company‚Äôs guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now ‚Äúexpecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.‚Äù In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company‚Äôs full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, ‚Äúdue to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.‚Äù Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance‚Äôs conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Elevance Health class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/ELV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).
